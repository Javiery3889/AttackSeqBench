### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - SideCopy targets government personnel in India.
     - Uses decoys and honeytraps to lure victims.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains.
     - Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs.
     - Also uses self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploys RATs and plugins post-infection.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Uses various techniques including malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses decoy documents and cloned websites.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Uses themes to target military personnel.
   - **Collection:**
     - Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Targets Kavach authentication databases and uses njRAT malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to deliver final payloads and establish initial access to victim systems before targeting Kavach.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report explicitly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their infection chains to deliver final payloads.
     - This is a consistent method used by SideCopy to establish initial access to victim systems.
   - **Targeting Kavach:**
     - The report indicates that SideCopy has a particular interest in Kavach and uses njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - The infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs are used to gain initial access, which is a prerequisite for targeting Kavach.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly outlines that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to establish initial access.
   - These techniques are part of the infection chain that leads to the deployment of final payloads.
   - Once initial access is established, SideCopy can then proceed to target Kavach and other sensitive information.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that SideCopy executes these infection chains before targeting Kavach.
