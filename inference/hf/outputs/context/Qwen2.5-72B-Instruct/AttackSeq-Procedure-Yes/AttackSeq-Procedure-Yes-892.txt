### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT28 uses spear-phishing campaigns with malicious URLs and exploit documents to gain initial access.
- They register domains spoofing legitimate organizations and webmail services.
- They exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255 to install malware.

**Execution:**
- Malware is executed through spear-phishing emails delivering exploit documents.
- Malware tools include GAMEFISH, CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE, OLDBAIT, and CORESHELL.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Use of zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
- Preference for using tools already present in the victim's systems.

**Credential Access:**
- Harvest credentials through spear-phishing and fake login pages.
- Use credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

**Others:**
- APT28 is attributed to the Russian Government and has been active since 2007.
- Targets political entities, governments, militaries, and other organizations.
- Engaged in data leaks and false flag operations.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After leveraging spear-phishing campaigns to harvest credentials during the Credential Access phase, is it likely that APT28 will use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into victim networks in the Lateral Movement phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing campaigns with malicious URLs and exploit documents.
2. **Execution:** Malware execution through exploit documents.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Use of zero-day vulnerabilities and legitimate tools.
4. **Credential Access:** Harvest credentials through spear-phishing and fake login pages.
5. **Lateral Movement:** Use of legitimate tools and harvested credentials.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report indicates that APT28 primarily uses spear-phishing to gain initial access and harvest credentials.
- After gaining credentials, APT28 uses these credentials and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
- The report does not explicitly state that APT28 uses known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before lateral movement.
- However, APT28 has demonstrated the ability to use zero-day vulnerabilities and exploit vulnerabilities in general, but this is more often associated with the initial access phase rather than the lateral movement phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- APT28's primary method for initial access and credential harvesting is through spear-phishing.
- Once credentials are harvested, they use these credentials and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
- The report does not suggest a specific sequence where APT28 exploits known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers before lateral movement.
- The use of known vulnerabilities is more aligned with the initial access phase to gain a foothold in the network.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
