### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information and use active discovery methods to target potential victims.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign to deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) using weaponized MS Office email attachments.
- Employees must enable macros for the RAT to be installed.

**Credential Access:**
- Once the RAT is installed, it conducts credential harvesting and network discovery.

**Discovery:**
- Adversaries use valid credentials and malware plugins to conduct internal reconnaissance and identify potential targets.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled Command and Control (C2) server after installation.

**Impact:**
- Adversaries develop and deliver data destruction malware, schedule UPS disruptions, trip breakers, sever connections to field devices, and initiate a telephony DoS attack.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After performing a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems, is it likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Relevant Information from the CTI Report:**
- **Initial Access:**
  - Adversaries send targeted emails containing modified MS Office files as attachments.
  - Employees must enable macros for the RAT to be installed.
- **Command and Control:**
  - Once the malicious VBA script is executed and the RAT is installed, it establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled C2 server.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the RAT (BlackEnergy 3) is delivered via a phishing campaign and requires employees to enable macros.
- Once the macros are enabled, the RAT is installed, and it establishes a C2 connection to enable further malicious activities.
- The C2 connection is a critical step in the attack sequence, allowing adversaries to control the infected systems and execute additional malicious actions.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**

The CTI report explicitly mentions that the RAT establishes a C2 connection after being installed via the malicious VBA script execution, which is a necessary step for the adversaries to control the infected systems and carry out further malicious activities.
