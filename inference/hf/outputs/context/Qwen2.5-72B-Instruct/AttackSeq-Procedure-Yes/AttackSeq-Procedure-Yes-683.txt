### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** The worm executed malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, to maintain control and spread.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed drivers and modified system files to ensure it ran at startup.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It used MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities to gain SYSTEM privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Stuxnet used rootkit techniques, digital certificates, and function hooking to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** It exploited MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities to spread across the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Stuxnet is likely to communicate with its C&C servers using encrypted channels after exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report confirms that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - **C&C Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of encrypted channels for C&C communication. However, it is common for sophisticated malware to use encryption to avoid detection and ensure secure communication.
   - **Sophistication of Stuxnet:** Given the advanced nature of Stuxnet, including its use of zero-day vulnerabilities, rootkits, and digital certificates, it is reasonable to assume that it would also use encrypted channels for C&C communication to maintain stealth and security.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** Stuxnet's initial access and execution phases are well-documented and involve sophisticated techniques.
   - **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** The malware ensures persistence and gains high-level privileges, indicating a high level of sophistication.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Stuxnet employs multiple techniques to evade detection, including rootkits and digital certificates.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The use of known vulnerabilities for lateral movement is confirmed.
   - **C&C Communication:** While not explicitly stated, the sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it would use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure secure command and control.
