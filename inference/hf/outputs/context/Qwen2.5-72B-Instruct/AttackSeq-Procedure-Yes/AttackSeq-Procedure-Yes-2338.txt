### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Phishing email impersonating a senior partner of the Brazilian law firm 'Veirano Advogados'.
- Email contained a PowerPoint add-in document with a '.ppa' extension.
- The '.ppa' file included an auto-open VBA macro.

**Execution:**
- VBA macro used 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
- The dropper concealed VBScript code in an invisible blog post.
- The script stored a base64 encoded version of the 'RevengeRAT' payload in the registry.
- The script decoded and executed the payload.
- Another VBScript was created to download a new payload from 'hxxp://cdtmaster.com[.]br'.

**Persistence:**
- Malware established persistence by creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with the URL 'hxxps://pocasideiascdt.blogspot[.]com/' every two hours.

**Others:**
- 'Document.exe' file with a Pokemon Megaball icon hosted at 'cdtmaster.com[.]br'.
- 'Document.exe' deployed and ran the 'Outlook.exe' payload.
- 'Outlook.exe' opened a listening TCP socket on localhost.
- Common TTPs with previous reports, such as shared infrastructure and popular RATs.
- Domain 'cdtmaster.com[.]br' hosted other suspicious files, including a variant of 'njRAT'.
- Indicators of compromise included various URLs and IP addresses.
- Yara rules provided for detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After establishing persistence through a scheduled task that executes 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours, is it likely that RevengeRAT will establish communication with its command and control (C2) servers and send victim machine information to domains such as 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net' while the attacker's infrastructure is identified to be located in Canada and Brazil?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper.
- The dropper stores and executes the 'RevengeRAT' payload.
- Persistence is established through a scheduled task.
- The 'Outlook.exe' payload opens a listening TCP socket on localhost.
- The domain 'cdtmaster.com[.]br' is used for downloading payloads.
- Common TTPs with previous reports, including shared infrastructure and popular RATs.

**Relevance to the Question:**
- The report confirms that the malware establishes persistence and downloads and executes the 'RevengeRAT' payload.
- The 'RevengeRAT' is a known Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that can establish communication with C2 servers.
- The report does not explicitly mention the specific C2 domains 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net'.
- The report does mention that the attacker's infrastructure is located in Brazil, which aligns with the use of Brazilian domains.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The malware is capable of establishing communication with C2 servers.
  - The use of dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains like 'duckdns.org' and 'ddns.net' is common in C2 infrastructure.
  - The attacker's infrastructure being in Brazil and Canada is consistent with the use of Brazilian domains.
- **B: No**
  - The report does not explicitly mention the specific C2 domains.
  - However, the behavior of 'RevengeRAT' and the use of DDNS domains are plausible.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the capabilities of 'RevengeRAT' and the common use of DDNS domains in C2 infrastructure, it is likely that the malware will establish communication with C2 servers and send victim machine information to the specified domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
