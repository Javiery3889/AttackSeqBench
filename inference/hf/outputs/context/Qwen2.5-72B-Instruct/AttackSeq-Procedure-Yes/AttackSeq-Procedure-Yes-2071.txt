### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Whitefly uses spear-phishing emails with a dropper to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The dropper executes a loader (Trojan.Vcrodat) that uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs and establish communication with a C&C domain.
   - **Persistence:** Whitefly maintains long-term access using tools like a simple remote shell and Termite.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Whitefly exploits a known Windows vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Whitefly uses search order hijacking and custom malware to remain undetected.
   - **Credential Access:** Whitefly uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using stolen credentials, Whitefly compromises additional machines.
   - **Collection:** Whitefly aims to steal large volumes of sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Whitefly exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using stolen credentials for lateral movement, Whitefly is likely to use publicly available tools and exploit vulnerabilities to discover and control more systems before employing tools to facilitate the collection of large volumes of sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that Whitefly uses stolen credentials to compromise additional machines on the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Whitefly uses publicly available tools (Mimikatz) and exploits vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-0051) to gain higher privileges and remain undetected.
   - **Collection:** The report indicates that Whitefly's objective is to steal large volumes of sensitive information, which involves remaining in the network for extended periods and using tools to facilitate data theft.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After compromising additional machines using stolen credentials, it is logical for Whitefly to continue using publicly available tools and exploiting vulnerabilities to discover and control more systems. This aligns with the group's goal of maintaining long-term access and exfiltrating large volumes of information.
   - The use of tools like Mimikatz and the exploitation of vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-0051) are consistent with the group's tactics for privilege escalation and defense evasion.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (using stolen credentials for lateral movement, then using publicly available tools and exploiting vulnerabilities to discover and control more systems, and finally employing tools for data collection) is a plausible and logical progression based on the CTI report.
