### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery. Once a server is compromised, they further penetrate the internal network using manual online hacking and an automated USB infection mechanism.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan consists of a main executable and a DLL file. The DLL is dynamically loaded and unloaded as needed.
   - **Persistence:** The Explosive Trojan can be installed with various service names and paths. It uses files and directories to store keylog data and other extracted information.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan avoids detection by frequently checking AV results, changing versions, and monitoring memory consumption. It also detaches suspicious API activities to a separate DLL.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** The campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework for control, including C&C servers, static update servers, and dynamic update servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Explosive Trojan is likely to use writable mass storage devices infected through a configurable USB infection option for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement via USB:** The report mentions an automated USB infection mechanism for further penetration into the internal network. This suggests that the attackers use USB devices for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** The report clearly states that the campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework for control, which includes C&C servers, static update servers, and dynamic update servers.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions. However, it is logical to assume that after gaining initial access and establishing persistence, the attackers would use the USB infection mechanism for lateral movement before setting up the multi-tiered server backend for command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Persistence:** The attackers gain initial access through web server vulnerabilities and establish persistence using various service names and paths.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions an automated USB infection mechanism, which is a plausible method for lateral movement within the network.
   - **Command and Control:** After gaining control of multiple systems, the attackers set up a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described in the CTI report, it is likely that the Explosive Trojan will use writable mass storage devices infected through a configurable USB infection option for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
