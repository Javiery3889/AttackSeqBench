### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email campaign that delivered a URL leading to an archived payload containing an executable and a decoy PDF.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and began sending commands to gather system information, take screenshots, and execute system commands.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking was used for persistence, and a custom backdoor was installed.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Files and processes were deleted and security tools were disabled.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumpers were used to target browsers and email clients to retrieve credentials.
   - **Collection:** The malware scanned for files with specific extensions on local, network, and removable drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server was established using common ports and encrypted data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were prepared and sent to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment, including registry keys enumeration and running process listing, after performing defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report states that the Sednit group deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Information Gathering:** The report mentions that the operators gathered system information, network scanning, and executed various system commands to collect data from the victim's computer. This includes taking screenshots and gathering system information, which can be inferred to include registry keys enumeration and running process listing.
   - **File Scanning:** The report also states that the malware scanned for files with specific extensions on local, network, and removable drives.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the report suggests that after performing defense evasion, the Sednit group indeed gathered information about the victim's computer and environment. This information gathering is a crucial step in understanding the victim's system and identifying valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - The report explicitly mentions that the operators gathered system information and executed various system commands, which aligns with the actions of enumerating registry keys and listing running processes.
