### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which opens a decoy file and runs the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks, use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating processes, gathering browser data, keylogger information.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication, implementing fallback channels, downloading additional files for execution.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to automatically copy data from all drives in a compromised system to a removable drive if a specific file is present on that drive during its exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report does not explicitly state that Machete automatically copies data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present. However, it does mention that Machete copies files from local systems and removable media.
   - **Conditional Copying:** The question introduces a condition (if a specific file is present on the removable drive). The report does not provide any information about conditional copying based on the presence of a specific file.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that Machete is capable of copying files from local systems and removable media, but it does not specify any conditional behavior based on the presence of a specific file on the removable drive.
   - The exfiltration process described in the report is more general and does not include the specific condition mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide evidence to support the claim that Machete automatically copies data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present on that drive during its exfiltration phase. The report only mentions general data collection and exfiltration activities without any conditional behavior based on the presence of a specific file.
