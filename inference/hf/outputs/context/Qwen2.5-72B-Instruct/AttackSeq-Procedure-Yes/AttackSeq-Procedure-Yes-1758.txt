### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email.
- The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

**Execution:**
- Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- On July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed.
- On July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload for the attack.

**Persistence:**
- Shuckworm established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes.
- These tasks ensured that their backdoor would remain active even after system reboots.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Shuckworm utilized mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
- They used scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection and maintain their foothold.

**Collection:**
- Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.
- It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has been tracking Shuckworm's cyber-espionage activities against Ukraine.
- Shuckworm, also known as Gamaredon or Armageddon, has been active since at least 2013.
- The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) reported that Shuckworm has been using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks.
- Symantec's investigation revealed seven files used by Shuckworm in their attacks, all of which are 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries.
- The IOCs from the investigation showed patterns such as C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers and suspected malicious files found in specific directories with names starting with the letter 'd'.
- The SSU report from November 2021 attributed over 5,000 attacks to Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After executing VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and deploying additional variants of Pterodo, is it likely that Shuckworm will establish command and control by using HTTP requests and interacting with C&C servers such as deep-pitched.enarto.ru before downloading additional payloads?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Opening of a malicious document (phishing email) → Execution of Pterodo backdoor.
2. **Execution:** Execution of VBS scripts and HTA files → Creation of scheduled tasks → Execution of additional Pterodo variants → Installation of VNC client.
3. **Persistence:** Creation of scheduled tasks to execute VBS files.
4. **Defense Evasion:** Use of mshta.exe and scheduled tasks to evade detection.
5. **Collection:** Deployment of multiple VBS backdoor variants and execution of VBS scripts.

**Contextual Information:**
- Shuckworm has been using C&C servers and living-off-the-land tools.
- IOCs show patterns of C&C IPs and malicious files.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions the use of C&C servers and the establishment of command and control, which is a common next step after gaining initial access and executing initial payloads.
- The use of HTTP requests to interact with C&C servers is a typical method for maintaining command and control and downloading additional payloads.
- The specific C&C server mentioned (deep-pitched.enarto.ru) aligns with the pattern of C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that Shuckworm uses C&C servers and living-off-the-land tools.
- After executing VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and deploying additional variants of Pterodo, it is logical for Shuckworm to establish command and control.
- The use of HTTP requests to interact with C&C servers and download additional payloads is a common and expected step in the attack chain.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
