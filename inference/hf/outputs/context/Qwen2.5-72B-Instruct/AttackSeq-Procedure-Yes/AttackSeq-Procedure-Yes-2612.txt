### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers use fake mobile applications (e.g., ISIS branded wallpaper changer, ANF Kurdistan news updates, fake Vidogram) to entice victims.
- These applications are designed to appeal to specific groups (Kurdish and Turkish natives, ISIS supporters, Iranian citizens).

**Collection:**
- The malware embedded in these applications collects various types of data:
  - Contact lists
  - Phone call records
  - SMS messages
  - Browser history and bookmarks
  - Geo-location
  - Photos
  - Surrounding voice recordings
- The collected data is sent back to the attackers' command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Others:**
- The operation has affected around 240 users, primarily Iranian citizens.
- The attackers document the campaign meticulously, including application names and code names.
- The number of people affected is much higher due to the harvesting of contact lists and recording of phone calls and SMS details.
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) include hashes and IP addresses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After leveraging mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information such as contact lists and geo-location from victims during the Collection phase, is it likely the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware collects a wide range of data from the victims' devices.
- The collected data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report explicitly states that the collected data is sent back to the C&C servers using HTTP POST requests, which is an application layer protocol.
- **B: No**
  - This answer is incorrect because the report clearly indicates that the data is sent using HTTP POST requests, which is an application layer protocol.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the collected data is sent back to the C&C servers using HTTP POST requests.
- HTTP POST is an application layer protocol.
- Therefore, it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
