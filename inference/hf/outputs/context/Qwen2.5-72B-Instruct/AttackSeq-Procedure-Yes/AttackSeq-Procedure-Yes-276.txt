### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
- The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
- The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services and redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker.
- The VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time.
- The malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components.
- The final Bandook payload is signed with valid certificates to appear trustworthy.

**Command and Control:**
- The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process.
- The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and awaits further commands.
- The communication protocol with the C&C server uses AES encryption.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access, is it likely that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malicious Word document inside a ZIP file.
   - Document contains encrypted script data and an external template.
   - External template is downloaded and redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker.
   - VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Execution:**
   - 'fmx.ps1' is a PowerShell script.
   - 'sdmc.jpg' contains base64 encoded PowerShell code.

**Contextual Information:**
- The VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops the files.
- The 'fmx.ps1' script is likely to be the primary script that executes the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly state that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
- However, it is logical to infer that 'fmx.ps1' would decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' as part of the initial execution process.
- The report focuses on the initial access and the initial execution of the dropped files, but does not mention a subsequent download of a zip file.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.
- It is reasonable to assume that 'fmx.ps1' is designed to decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' as part of the initial execution process.
- The report does not mention any additional steps involving the download of a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
