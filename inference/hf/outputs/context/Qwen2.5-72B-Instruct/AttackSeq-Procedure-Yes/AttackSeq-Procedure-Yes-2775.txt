### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Dragonfly campaign conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
   - **Resource Development:** They created or gained user accounts and used remote-desktop protocol to operate stealthily.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
   - **Execution:** They used backdoor malware embedded within trusted software.
   - **Persistence:** They created or gained user accounts and used remote-desktop protocol.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They incorporated code from TeamViewer into their backdoor and used self-deleting code.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used remote-desktop protocol to move laterally.
   - **Impact:** They have the ability to take offensive disruptive and destructive action.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence during the defense evasion tactic, the Dragonfly group likely focused on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic before using the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the Dragonfly attackers used self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that they used remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention a discovery phase where they gather system information, but it is a logical step in the attack chain. Discovery is often necessary to understand the environment and identify targets for lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement:** The use of self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence is a clear defense evasion tactic. After evading detection, it is logical for the attackers to gather system information to understand the environment and identify targets for lateral movement.
   - **Windows Systems:** The report does not specify the operating system, but given that remote-desktop protocol (RDP) is commonly used on Windows systems, it is reasonable to assume that the Dragonfly group targeted Windows systems.
   - **Discovery Phase:** While not explicitly mentioned, the discovery phase is a critical step in the attack chain. Attackers need to gather information about the network and systems to effectively move laterally.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The Dragonfly group likely focused on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic before using the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems.
