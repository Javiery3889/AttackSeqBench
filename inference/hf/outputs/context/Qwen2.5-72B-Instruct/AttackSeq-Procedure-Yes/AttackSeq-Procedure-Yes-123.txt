### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Exploiting public-facing applications (e.g., FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection).
- Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Deploying custom malware, including the .NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper'.
- 'IPsec Helper' is registered as a service for persistence.
- Capabilities: Exfiltrate data, deploy additional malware, execute commands, upload files, update configuration based on C2 commands.

**Persistence:**
- Deploying webshells.
- Registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Using obfuscated webshells (variations of ASPXSpy).
- 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic.
- Leveraging compromised accounts and offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Awaits commands for updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction after the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- 'IPsec Helper' is a versatile backdoor that can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.
- The backdoor can send recon information and download files.
- Agrius uses a variety of tools and techniques for persistence, defense evasion, and lateral movement.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.
- However, the backdoor's capabilities suggest that it can be used to deploy additional malware.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The backdoor 'IPsec Helper' has the capability to download and execute additional malware.
  - Agrius has a history of using various tools and techniques for data exfiltration and persistence.
  - The deployment of wipers and data destruction malware is a plausible next step in a cyber attack, especially if the initial objectives (recon, data exfiltration) have been achieved.

- **B: No**
  - The report does not explicitly state that Agrius deploys 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.
  - However, the absence of this information does not rule out the possibility, given the backdoor's capabilities and the group's history.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the capabilities of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and the group's history of using various tools and techniques, it is plausible that Agrius would deploy additional malware, including wipers, for data destruction after achieving initial objectives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
