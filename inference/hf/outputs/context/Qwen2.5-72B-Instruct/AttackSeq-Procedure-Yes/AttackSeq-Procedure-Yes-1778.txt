### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** The malware gains initial access through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses Base64 encoding and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. It also gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sayad malware will collect keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media before uploading the encrypted data to a malicious web server during the exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the malware collects a wide range of information, including system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. It also gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report mentions that the malware uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - **Additional Data Collection:** The report does not explicitly mention the collection of keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, or data from removable media. However, the malware's capability to collect a wide range of information suggests that it might have the ability to collect additional data types.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware is designed to gather a comprehensive set of information from the compromised host.
   - While the report does not explicitly state the collection of keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, or data from removable media, the malware's broad data collection capabilities and the lack of specific exclusion of these data types make it plausible that the malware could collect such data.
   - The exfiltration phase involves uploading the collected and encrypted data, which could include the additional data types mentioned in the question.
