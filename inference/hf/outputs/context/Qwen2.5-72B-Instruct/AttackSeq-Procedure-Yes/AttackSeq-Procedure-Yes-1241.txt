### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The malicious Office document's Macro executes only if a disk serial number is detected.
     - The Macro downloads an image from Google Drive, which contains a base64-encoded binary appended at the end, separated by the string '****'.
     - The binary is an AutoIT script that downloads a new file from Google Drive.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The final payload, JhoneRAT, creates persistence by adding an entry named 'ChromeUpdater' to the 'Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - JhoneRAT avoids execution on virtual machines by checking for disk serial numbers.
     - The Python bytecode header is removed to hinder analysis.
   - **Discovery:**
     - JhoneRAT checks the system's keyboard layout to target specific Arabic-speaking countries.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - JhoneRAT uses cloud services for command and control activities.
     - It checks for new commands in tweets from the handle @jhone87438316 every 10 seconds.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - JhoneRAT exfiltrates screenshots via ImgBB and sends command execution feedback to Google Forms.
     - It can also download files encoded in base64 from Google Drive.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will execute a Macro to download a base64-encoded binary before achieving persistence by creating a 'ChromeUpdater' entry in the Windows registry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Sequence:**
     - The Macro in the malicious Office document executes first.
     - The Macro downloads an image from Google Drive, which contains a base64-encoded binary.
     - The binary is an AutoIT script that downloads a new file from Google Drive.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The final payload, JhoneRAT, creates persistence by adding an entry named 'ChromeUpdater' to the registry.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the Macro executes first and downloads the base64-encoded binary.
   - After the binary is executed, the final payload, JhoneRAT, is delivered.
   - JhoneRAT then creates persistence by adding the 'ChromeUpdater' entry to the registry.
   - Therefore, the sequence of events is:
     1. Macro execution
     2. Downloading the base64-encoded binary
     3. Persistence creation
