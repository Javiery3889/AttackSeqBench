### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd binary and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary at /system/bin/netd and checks if init is the parent process.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware scrapes files containing credentials and uses tcpdump to monitor network traffic.
   - **Collection:** The netd component collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses SCP, Tor hidden services, and SSH for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The netd component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using Tor and SSH.
   - **Impact:** The malware impacts the netd service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel's netd component will list installed packages as part of its software discovery before collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Persistence:** The malware replaces the legitimate netd binary and persists by ensuring it is executed by init.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Collection:** The netd component collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Software Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention that the malware lists installed packages as part of its software discovery process. The focus is on collecting specific files and communication data.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the malware's actions, including execution, persistence, privilege escalation, and collection of specific files and communication data.
   - The report does not mention any activity related to listing installed packages or performing software discovery.
   - Given the focus on collecting specific files and communication data, it is less likely that the malware would engage in listing installed packages as part of its software discovery before collecting files.
