### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Whitefly uses spear-phishing emails with a dropper to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The dropper executes a loader (Trojan.Vcrodat) that uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs and establish communication with a C&C domain.
   - **Persistence:** Whitefly maintains long-term access using tools like a simple remote shell and Termite.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Whitefly exploits a known Windows vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Whitefly uses search order hijacking and custom malware to remain undetected.
   - **Credential Access:** Whitefly heavily relies on Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Whitefly maps the network and infects further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - **Collection:** Whitefly steals large volumes of sensitive information over extended periods.
   - **Command and Control:** Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Whitefly exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Whitefly will compromise additional machines using stolen credentials after the discovery phase to expand their control within the organization.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that Whitefly maps the network and infects further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that Whitefly heavily relies on Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that Whitefly uses stolen credentials to compromise additional machines and escalate privileges within the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After the discovery phase, where Whitefly maps the network and infects further computers, it is logical that the group would use the stolen credentials to compromise additional machines. This aligns with the report's description of Whitefly's use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials and the subsequent use of these credentials to expand their control within the organization.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report supports the idea that Whitefly would use stolen credentials to move laterally and gain deeper access to the network.
