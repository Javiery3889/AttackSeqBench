### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Regin can use various methods, including spoofed websites, web browser exploits, and application exploits. It was also observed to originate from Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin's execution involves a multi-staged architecture:
     - **Stage 0:** Dropper installs Regin.
     - **Stage 1:** Loads a kernel driver.
     - **Stage 2:** Another kernel driver that extracts, installs, and runs Stage 3.
     - **Stage 3:** Kernel mode DLL that loads Stage 4.
     - **Stage 4:** User-mode orchestrator and multiple kernel payload modules, stored in EVFS containers.
     - **Stage 5:** Main Regin payload, injecting files into services.exe.
   - **Persistence:** Not explicitly detailed, but the multi-staged architecture and use of kernel drivers and EVFS suggest long-term persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses encrypted data blobs and advanced techniques to remain hidden.
   - **Credential Access:** Capable of stealing passwords and monitoring network traffic.
   - **Collection:** Extensive capabilities including RAT features, capturing screenshots, controlling mouse, gathering computer information, stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, and crawling the file system.
   - **Command and Control:** Extensive and bidirectional, using various encrypted transport protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization before employing its extensive remote access Trojan capabilities to capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization:**
     - The CTI report does not explicitly mention Regin gathering information on processes and memory utilization as a specific step before employing its RAT capabilities.
   - **Remote Access Trojan Capabilities:**
     - The report clearly states that Regin has extensive RAT capabilities, including capturing screenshots and crawling through the file system.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report describes the execution and collection capabilities in a general sense but does not provide a specific sequence of actions that Regin follows after injecting files into services.exe.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Execution and Injection:**
     - Regin's execution process involves multiple stages, with Stage 5 injecting files into services.exe.
   - **Collection Capabilities:**
     - After injection, Regin's collection capabilities are extensive and include capturing screenshots and crawling through the file system.
   - **Process and Memory Utilization:**
     - While Regin is capable of advanced techniques, the report does not specify that it gathers information on processes and memory utilization as a prerequisite step before employing its RAT capabilities.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided in the CTI report, Regin is likely to employ its extensive remote access Trojan capabilities to capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection without explicitly gathering information on processes and memory utilization as a prerequisite step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
