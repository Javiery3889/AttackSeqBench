### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved through PowerShell commands that downloaded malicious payloads from URLs hosted on compromised servers.
   - **Execution:** The execution phase involved PowerShell commands that initiated the download of a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems. The script checked the Windows version and applied hotfixes for vulnerabilities, then used the PowerSploit module to reflectively load an exploit bundle binary with the target vulnerability and an MSI command as arguments. As a failover, it used the Tater module to launch the MSI command.
   - **Persistence:** The MSI package installed by PurpleFox ensured persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations from the registry and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory. It modified registry values under 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager' to allow for file rename operations upon system restart, effectively replacing sens.dll with the malware to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
   - **Command and Control:** The new .NET backdoor, named FoxSocket, leveraged WebSockets to establish a robust and secure command-and-control (C&C) channel with its servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PurpleFox is likely to remove old PurpleFox-related registry keys before leveraging rootkit drivers to hide the registry keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Phase Details:**
     - The report explicitly states that the MSI package installed by PurpleFox "ensured persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations from the registry and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory."
     - It also mentions that it "modified registry values under 'HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager' to allow for file rename operations upon system restart, effectively replacing sens.dll with the malware to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS)."
   - **Rootkit Drivers:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of rootkit drivers to hide registry keys. However, the removal of old registry keys is a clear step in the persistence mechanism.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that PurpleFox removes old PurpleFox-related registry keys as part of its persistence mechanism.
   - The use of rootkit drivers to hide registry keys is not mentioned, but the removal of old keys is a necessary step to ensure that the new persistence mechanism is not detected.
   - Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that PurpleFox would remove old registry keys before any additional steps to hide them, if such steps were taken.
