### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing email containing trojaned Microsoft Word documents.
   - **Execution:** The 'Surtr' malware injects itself into a new explorer or iexplore process.
   - **Persistence:** 'Surtr' adds registry keys to ensure it runs on startup and stores C2 information.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) and evades detection by padding the resource section.
   - **Discovery:** 'Surtr' lists file directories, contents, and USB drives, views web cache, executes remote commands, and logs keystrokes. It creates folders to store temporary information.
   - **Others:** The malware can download additional components like 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0' and has been used in conjunction with Gh0st RAT derived 'LURK0' malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if 'Surtr' is likely to connect to a C2 server and download a stage two component to a specific directory after discovering file directories and creating temporary folders.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:** The report states that 'Surtr' has the capability to list file directories and contents, and it creates folders to store temporary information.
   - **C2 Communication and Downloading Components:** The report mentions that 'Surtr' can download additional components like 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0'. This implies that 'Surtr' has the capability to connect to a C2 server and download additional components.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that after discovering file directories and creating temporary folders, the malware would connect to the C2 server to download additional components.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:** 'Surtr' discovers file directories and contents and creates temporary folders.
   - **C2 Communication:** Given the malware's capabilities, it is likely to connect to the C2 server.
   - **Downloading Components:** The report mentions that 'Surtr' can download additional components, which suggests that it would do so after establishing a connection to the C2 server.
