### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The attackers deployed updated versions of their malware, Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe.
- Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications.
- Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns to potentially evade detection.

**Command and Control:**
- The updated Aumlib malware sample (hash: 832f5e01be536da71d5b3f7e41938cfb) was downloaded from URLs such as status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js or status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/css.css.
- The new Ixeshe sample (hash: aa873ed803ca800ce92a39d9a683c644) contains encoded data with victim information and a campaign tag.

**Others:**
- APT12 has been silent since January after an expose and has now re-emerged with improved malware.
- The changes in their TTPs suggest a deliberate evolution in response to external pressures.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that APT12 will:
- Encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware.
- Employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic.
- Do these as part of defense evasion before connecting to specific URLs such as status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js during command and control.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications.
- Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns to potentially evade detection.
- Both malware samples are downloaded from specific URLs (e.g., status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js).

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**

**Choice A: Yes**
- This choice aligns with the report's details:
  - Aumlib encoding HTTP communications.
  - Ixeshe exhibiting new network traffic patterns, which could include different encoding patterns.
  - Both actions are part of defense evasion.
  - The URLs mentioned in the report match those in the question.

**Choice B: No**
- This choice does not align with the report's details:
  - The report explicitly states that Aumlib encodes HTTP communications and Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns.
  - These actions are consistent with defense evasion techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that Aumlib encodes HTTP communications and Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns.
- These actions are consistent with defense evasion techniques.
- The URLs mentioned in the question (status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js) are the same as those in the report.
- Therefore, it is likely that APT12 will encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe traffic as part of defense evasion before connecting to the specified URLs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
