### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack used a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
- The exploit involved a heap spray attack and shellcode injection.
- A secondary payload was downloaded from a server.
- The dropper, once executed, deleted itself.

**Execution:**
- The malware's execution involved a two-stage installation.
- The dropper installed the payload as a service.
- The payload accessed an encrypted embedded resource to obtain the C&C server DNS name.

**Persistence:**
- The malware achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names.
- It modified registry keys.
- The dropper decompressed an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 directory and loaded it as a service.
- Registry keys were created and then deleted as part of the process.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The dropper modified the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
- The DLL was loaded into its own svchost.exe process.
- The dropper deleted itself using a dissolving batch file.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after the defense evasion techniques (modifying file-time and loading into svchost.exe), the Aurora malware is likely to communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the Report:**
- The payload accessed an encrypted embedded resource to obtain the C&C server DNS name.
- The report does not explicitly mention the communication protocol or port used for C&C communication.
- The report does not specify the encryption scheme used for C&C communication.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware communicates over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.
  - The report does not provide specific information about the communication port or the encryption scheme.
  - Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which is a common choice for C&C communication to blend in with normal traffic.
  - However, the report does not mention the use of a weak custom encryption scheme.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware does not communicate over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.
  - The report does not provide specific information about the communication port or the encryption scheme.
  - Given the lack of information, it is more prudent to assume that the report does not support the claim of a weak custom encryption scheme.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The report does not explicitly state the communication port or the encryption scheme used by the Aurora malware.
- While port 443 is a common choice for C&C communication, the report does not confirm this.
- The report does not mention the use of a weak custom encryption scheme.
- Therefore, it is more likely that the report does not support the claim in Choice A.

**Final Answer: B: No**
