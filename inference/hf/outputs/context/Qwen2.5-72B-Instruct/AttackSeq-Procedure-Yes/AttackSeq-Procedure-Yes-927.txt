### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan is executed, consisting of a main executable binary and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:** The Explosive Trojan can be installed with various service names and paths, and it uses several files and directories for storing keylog data and other information.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan avoids detection by frequently changing versions, monitoring memory consumption, and detaching suspicious API activities to a separate DLL.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network, and recent versions of the Trojan include a USB infection mechanism.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Volatile Cedar campaign will use a multi-tiered server backend framework, including static and dynamic update servers, for command and control after extracting administrator passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:** The report does not mention a multi-tiered server backend framework during the initial stages of the attack.
   - **Execution and Persistence:** The report describes the use of various service names and paths for persistence, but it does not explicitly mention a multi-tiered server backend.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the Trojan avoids detection by frequently changing versions and monitoring memory consumption, but it does not specify the use of a multi-tiered server backend.
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms that the Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report describes the use of initially infected servers as pivots and a USB infection mechanism, but it does not mention a multi-tiered server backend for command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report focuses on the initial stages of the attack, the persistence mechanisms, and the methods used to avoid detection. It does not provide explicit information about a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.
   - The use of a multi-tiered server backend is a sophisticated method for maintaining command and control, but the report does not indicate that this is a part of the Volatile Cedar campaign's known tactics.
   - Given the focus on avoiding detection and the specific methods described, it is more likely that the campaign uses simpler, more direct methods for command and control rather than a complex multi-tiered server backend.
