### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Execution:** They use JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Persistence:** They use trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and email communications for command and control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** They use process memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** They use native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 would exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories after transferring tools and encoding data for communication during the command and control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - The report states that FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
     - They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
     - They use utilities and libraries to archive collected data.
     - The use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration is not explicitly mentioned, but the report does indicate that they use web shells for initial access and command execution.
   - **Web Shells and JSP Tools:**
     - Web shells are a consistent gateway for FIN13 into victim networks.
     - JSPRAT is used for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
     - Given their use of web shells and JSP tools for initial access and command execution, it is plausible that they would use these tools for exfiltration as well.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FIN13 uses web shells and JSP tools for initial access and command execution.
   - They transfer tools and encode data for communication during the command and control phase.
   - They collect and stage data for exfiltration.
   - Given their use of web shells and JSP tools for other stages of the attack, it is reasonable to infer that they would use these tools for exfiltration as well.
