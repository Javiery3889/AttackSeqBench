### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macros to spread.
   - **Collection:** Searching for sensitive documents, scanning drives, and taking screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:** Using HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that Gamaredon's malware searches for sensitive documents and takes screenshots. This indicates that the group is actively collecting data.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** The report mentions that the group's malware uses both HTTP and HTTPS for C&C. This suggests that the group has the capability to communicate with the C&C server to send and receive data.
   - **Exfiltration:** While the report does not explicitly state that the collected data is automatically uploaded to the C&C server, the combination of the collection and C&C capabilities strongly implies that the group would have the means to exfiltrate the data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Collection:** The malware is designed to search for and collect sensitive documents and take screenshots.
   - **C&C Communication:** The malware uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Given the group's focus on gathering sensitive information and their use of C&C communication, it is highly likely that the collected data would be exfiltrated to the C&C server.
