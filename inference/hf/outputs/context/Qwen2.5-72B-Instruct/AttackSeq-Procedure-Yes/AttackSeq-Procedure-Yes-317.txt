### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** W32.Flamer used a man-in-the-middle attack against Windows Update to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers disabled unnecessary logging and securely deleted log files regularly. They also configured C&C servers to record minimal information.
   - **Collection:** Data was collected from compromised systems and uploaded to C&C servers, encrypted with a public key.
   - **Command and Control:** C&C servers were managed through a Web application called Newsforyou, which processed client interactions and provided a control panel for attackers.
   - **Exfiltration:** Stolen data was uploaded to C&C servers, archived, and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the C&C servers delivered a module instructing W32.Flamer to self-destruct and remove all traces of the malware from compromised systems as part of the impact phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impact Phase:** The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines the Impact phase as actions that disrupt business processes or deny access to resources. Self-destruction and removal of traces of malware can be considered part of the impact phase, as it can hinder forensic analysis and recovery efforts.
   - **Report Details:** The report does not explicitly mention any self-destruction or removal of traces of the malware. However, the attackers took significant steps to avoid detection and hamper investigations, such as disabling logging and securely deleting log files.
   - **Contextual Information:** The sophisticated nature of the attack and the organized group behind it suggest that they would take additional steps to cover their tracks, including potentially instructing the malware to self-destruct.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not directly state that the C&C servers delivered a module for self-destruction, the context and the sophisticated nature of the attack suggest that such a step is plausible. The attackers' focus on avoiding detection and minimizing traceability aligns with the idea of instructing the malware to self-destruct.
   - However, the report does not provide concrete evidence of this specific action.

### Final Answer
Given the lack of explicit evidence in the report, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
