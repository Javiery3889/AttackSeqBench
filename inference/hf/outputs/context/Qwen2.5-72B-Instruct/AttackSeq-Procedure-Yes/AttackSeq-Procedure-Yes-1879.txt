### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. BLUEAGAVE establishes a local HTTP server.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, certutil, and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Data from network shared drives, archived using utilities.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Web services, web shells, and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to employ network sniffing to obtain credentials after using trojanized KeePass binaries for privilege escalation, before gathering network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log passwords, which is a form of credential harvesting.
   - **Network Sniffing:** The report does not explicitly mention network sniffing as a technique used by FIN13. However, it does mention the use of Mimikatz and ProcDump for credential harvesting, which are more targeted methods.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which includes gathering network and host configuration details.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords, which is a form of credential harvesting.
   - **Network Sniffing:** While network sniffing is a common technique for credential harvesting, the report does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses it. Instead, they use more targeted methods like Mimikatz and ProcDump.
   - **Discovery:** After privilege escalation, FIN13 gathers network and host configuration details using various tools and methods.

Given the information in the report, it is more likely that FIN13 would use targeted methods like Mimikatz and ProcDump for credential harvesting rather than network sniffing. Therefore, the sequence of using trojanized KeePass binaries for privilege escalation, followed by gathering network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance, is more plausible.

### Final Answer: B: No
