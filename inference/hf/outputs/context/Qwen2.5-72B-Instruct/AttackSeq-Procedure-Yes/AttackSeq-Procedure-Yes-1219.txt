### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR before exfiltrating this data to a Dropbox account via the cURL for Windows command-line tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Details from the CTI Report:**
     - The report explicitly states that the attackers used custom malware that employed WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload exfiltrated files to the Dropbox API.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller using Mimikatz for credential theft, the next logical step in the exfiltration process would be to compress the data and then exfiltrate it.
     - The use of WinRAR and cURL for Windows is directly mentioned in the exfiltration section of the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that APT10 used WinRAR to compress the exfiltrated files.
   - The report also mentions that cURL for Windows was used to upload the compressed files to the Dropbox API.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question aligns perfectly with the exfiltration method detailed in the CTI report.
