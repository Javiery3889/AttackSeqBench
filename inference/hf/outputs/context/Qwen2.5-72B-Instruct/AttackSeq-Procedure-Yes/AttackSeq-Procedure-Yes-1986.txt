### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- T1583.003: Compromise Infrastructure
- T1584: Compromise Software Supply Chain
- The adversary used compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
- The adversary used VPSs to host malware C2s.

**Initial Access:**
- T1566: Phishing
- T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment
- The adversary sent emails with a diplomatic theme and a PDF attachment.
- The PDF contained a link to ENVYSCOUT.

**Execution:**
- T1204: User Execution
- T1204.002: Malicious File
- The adversary relies on tricking users into executing malware.
- The adversary used malicious DLLs via DLL Hijacking to execute malware loaded via the PDF.

**Persistence:**
- T1547.001: Registry Run Keys
- T1574.001: DLL Search Order Hijacking
- T1574.002: DLL Side-Loading
- The adversary used the Run registry key to maintain persistence.
- The adversary used malicious DLLs loaded via DLL Hijacking into a process created from a legitimate binary to execute malware.
- The adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if the adversary is likely to:
- Utilize HTML Smuggling via ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
- Employ obfuscation techniques.
- Achieve persistence by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**HTML Smuggling:**
- The CTI report does not mention HTML Smuggling. It only mentions that the adversary used compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s.

**Obfuscation Techniques:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention obfuscation techniques. However, the use of DLL Hijacking and malicious DLLs suggests that the adversary is employing some form of obfuscation to avoid detection.

**Persistence:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the adversary achieves persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL. This aligns with the question.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **HTML Smuggling:** The CTI report does not mention HTML Smuggling, so this is not a likely technique used by the adversary.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** While not explicitly mentioned, the use of DLL Hijacking and malicious DLLs suggests that the adversary is employing some form of obfuscation.
- **Persistence:** The CTI report confirms that the adversary achieves persistence by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

Given the information in the CTI report, the adversary is likely to employ obfuscation techniques and achieve persistence by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL. However, the report does not support the use of HTML Smuggling.

**Final Answer: B: No**
