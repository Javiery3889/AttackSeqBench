### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance Phase:**
- **Phase 1: RECON (1-2 years)**
  - Fake personas on social platforms to gather identifiable information.
  - Use of social media mobile apps to steal contact list, emails, and SMS contents.
- **Phase 2: RECON (6 months)**
  - Long-term monitoring of targets via benign emails.
  - Sending daily emails duplicating local media content to build trust.
  - Tracking via Wasmyemailread[.]com and ifread[.]com.

**Initial Access Phase:**
- **Phase 3: Credential harvesting (1 day)**
  - Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset from Gmail, Apple iCloud, Etisalat, OWA outlook.
  - SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages.
  - Domain typo squatting.
  - Domains resolve only 1 day during the attack then shutdown.
  - Use of HTTPS on credential harvesting landing pages with free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt or COMODO.

**Execution Phase:**
- **Phase 4: Hacking targets (1 or twice per year)**
  - Use of emails related to previous interactions with links to drive-by downloads or direct malware attachments.
  - Weaponization and reuse of malware from different threat actors.
  - Reuse of command and control infrastructure from other groups.
  - Separation between spear phishing infrastructure and malware C2 infrastructure.

**Command and Control Phase:**
- **Phase 4: Hacking targets (1 or twice per year)**
  - Similar to the Execution phase, with a focus on command and control infrastructure.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates during the Credential Access phase.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Reconnaissance Phase:**
  - Long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com is clearly described.
- **Credential Access Phase:**
  - The report explicitly states that WINDSHIFT APT sends emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset pages.
  - It also mentions the use of SMS to redirect to credential harvesting pages.
  - The use of HTTPS with free SSL certificates on credential harvesting landing pages is also detailed.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly outlines that after the long-term monitoring and tracking during the Reconnaissance phase, WINDSHIFT APT moves to the Credential Access phase.
- In the Credential Access phase, the report specifies that WINDSHIFT APT sends emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset pages and uses SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages.
- The report also mentions the use of HTTPS with free SSL certificates on these landing pages.

Given this information, the sequence described in the question aligns perfectly with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
