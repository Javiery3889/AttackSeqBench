### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Persistence:** They use various methods, including trojanized KeePass binaries and malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to extract credentials and certutil for obfuscation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** They dump LSASS process memory and use trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** They gather network and host information using native OS binaries and custom malware.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI and custom web shells for remote command execution.
   - **Collection:** They collect and archive data from network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies and web shells for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including trojanized KeePass binaries and malware like SIXPACK.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report notes that FIN13 uses passive backdoors for stealth, which aligns with the use of BLUEAGAVE.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, it is logical for FIN13 to use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to maintain a low-profile presence and establish a local HTTP server for command execution.
   - Once the initial foothold is established and the passive backdoor is in place, FIN13 can then use other methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and SIXPACK to establish more robust persistence.
