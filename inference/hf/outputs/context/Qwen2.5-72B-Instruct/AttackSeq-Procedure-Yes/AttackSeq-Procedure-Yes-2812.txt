### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The adversary obtained SSH access to the target system.
- Used `wget` to fetch malware samples from the IP address 175.45.250.xxx.
- The malware binary had a date string in its naming convention, suggesting it was compiled on the day it was downloaded.

**Execution:**
- The custom loader loads the Derusbi malware into memory.
- Derusbi drops the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk, loads it into the kernel, and deletes it from disk to avoid detection.
- The client uses Turbo to hide relevant user space processes.

**Persistence:**
- The Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) provides persistence by hiding processes.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Derusbi malware and Turbo kernel module employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques.
- The Turbo LKM modifies the system's global call table to hide processes.
- The LKM disables the CPU's control register zero's (CR0) write protection to modify the system call table.

**Discovery:**
- The Derusbi malware gathers information about the victim host, including the local host name, GCC version, and system information.
- This information is transferred back to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via network beacons.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Derusbi malware gathers system information and beacons this data to the command and control infrastructure via destination port 443, is it likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses network beacons to transfer gathered information to the C2 infrastructure.
- The beacons are sent via destination port 443, which is commonly used for HTTPS traffic.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.
  - Given that the malware uses port 443, which is typically associated with HTTPS, it is plausible that the communication is obfuscated.
  - The use of HTTP POST requests to a specific endpoint (e.g., /photos/photo.asp) is a common technique for C2 communication to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware does not employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and does not include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.
  - This choice is less likely given the use of port 443 and the common practice of obfuscating C2 communications to avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the malware uses port 443 for network beacons, which is typically associated with HTTPS traffic.
- HTTPS traffic is inherently obfuscated, making it a likely choice for C2 communication to avoid detection.
- The use of HTTP POST requests to a specific endpoint (e.g., /photos/photo.asp) is a common technique to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the malware employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
