### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Word document that uses the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Execution:** The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt, which then runs PowerShell. The PowerShell script downloads a string from a URL and executes it as an encoded command. Another Base64 encoded PowerShell command is found in a config.txt file, which downloads a file and creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses.
   - **Command and Control:** The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto the victim's system.
   - **Others:** Additional context about the threat actor and the specific themes used in the attack.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely to observe the document creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence of the malware on the victim's system after using DDE and PowerShell to achieve execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the second PowerShell command, found in the config.txt file, downloads a file and creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - This aligns directly with the question's query about the creation of a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the second PowerShell command, which is Base64 encoded and found in the config.txt file, is responsible for downloading a file and creating a batch file and a registry entry.
   - This step is part of the attack sequence described in the report, specifically under the "Execution" section.
   - The creation of a batch file and a registry entry is a common technique used to ensure persistence, which is a key goal of many malware attacks.
