### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems, which implies a high level of reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained persistence but does not provide specific techniques.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access, implying the use of privilege escalation techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report details several defense evasion techniques, including T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network but does not provide specific techniques.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1568 Dynamic Resolution.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers used Defense Evasion techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls) to avoid detection before employing Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - The report explicitly mentions that the attackers used T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery Techniques:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry, but it is reasonable to infer that the attackers would have used these techniques to understand the environment and gather information necessary for their operations.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - It is logical for attackers to first evade detection to ensure they can operate undetected before performing discovery activities. This sequence aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where attackers first establish a foothold and then gather information about the environment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms the use of T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls for defense evasion.
   - The attackers' focus on information theft and espionage implies the need for discovery activities.
   - The logical sequence of operations would be to first evade detection and then perform discovery to understand the environment.
