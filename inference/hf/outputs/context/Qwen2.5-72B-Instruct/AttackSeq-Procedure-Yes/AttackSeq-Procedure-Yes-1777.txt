### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses Base64 encoding and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Discovery:** Collects system information, running processes, open ports, registered proxies, and data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Sayad malware captures screenshots as part of its data collection efforts before exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the Sayad malware's activities, but it does not explicitly mention capturing screenshots.
   - The report lists the following data collection activities:
     - System information
     - Running processes
     - Open ports
     - Registered proxies
     - Data from browsers, messengers, and other applications
   - The report does not include capturing screenshots in the list of collected data.
   - The focus of the malware seems to be on collecting sensitive information and credentials, which are then exfiltrated to the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a comprehensive list of the data collected by Sayad malware.
   - The absence of screenshot capture in the report suggests that it is not a primary or even a secondary data collection method for this malware.
   - Given the focus on collecting system and application details, credentials, and other sensitive information, it is less likely that the malware would also capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts.
