### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events like COVID-19.
   - **Persistence:** It creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, and changing file system paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It employs numerous tricks to evade detection, such as hooking APIs, checking for loaded modules, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks, checking for debugging tools, and detecting virtual environments.
   - **Credential Access:** It is capable of stealing credentials stored in Google Chrome and data stored in Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The CTI report explicitly states that Grandoreiro is capable of stealing credentials stored in Google Chrome and data stored in Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Information Collection:** The report also mentions that Grandoreiro collects information about the machine, including the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software, as part of its initial reconnaissance and communication with the C&C server.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order in which these actions occur, but it is logical to assume that after gaining initial access and collecting information about the machine, the malware would proceed to steal credentials to further its objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Information Collection:** Grandoreiro gains initial access through spam emails and collects information about the machine, including the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.
   - **Credential Access:** Given that the malware is designed to steal credentials, it is highly likely that it will attempt to steal credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting the initial information.
   - **Logical Sequence:** The sequence of actions (initial access, information collection, and credential access) is a common and logical progression in the lifecycle of a banking trojan like Grandoreiro.
