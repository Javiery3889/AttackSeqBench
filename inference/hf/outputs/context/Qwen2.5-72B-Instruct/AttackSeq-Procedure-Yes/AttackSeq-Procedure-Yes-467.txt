### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
- The attack resembles previous attacks against the global financial network SWIFT.

**Initial Access:**
- Financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails.
- The emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).

**Execution:**
- The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document.
- The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution.
- The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.

**Persistence:**
- Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Bankshot implant is designed to evade detection.
- It contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions.

**Command and Control:**
- The implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files.
- They communicate with three control servers, two of which are Chinese-language online gambling sites.
- The control server strings are hardcoded in the implants' code.

**Others:**
- The campaign has a high chance of success against victims with unpatched Flash.
- Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses and remain undetected on VirusTotal.
- This is the first time Bankshot has been tied directly to financial-related hacking and the first time it has been used since November 2017.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After targeting Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, is it likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on a victim's network.
- It contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions.
- The implant is used to gain access to specific financial organizations and has been connected to a major Korean bank attack.

**Tactic of Resource Development:**
- Resource Development involves establishing resources that can be used to support campaigns, such as developing or acquiring infrastructure, tools, and capabilities.

**Evaluation:**
- The Bankshot implant already has capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems (persistence and command and control).
- The implant also has the capability to wipe files from the targeted system, which is a form of defense evasion and can be used to erase evidence or perform destructive actions.
- However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop these capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development.
- The CTI report does not indicate that the development of these capabilities is part of the Resource Development phase. Instead, these capabilities are already present in the Bankshot implant and are used for persistence, defense evasion, and command and control.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The Bankshot implant already has the capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system.
- These capabilities are used for persistence, defense evasion, and command and control, not specifically for Resource Development.
- Therefore, it is not likely that Hidden Cobra will develop these capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development, as they are already present and used for other purposes.

**Final Answer: B: No**
