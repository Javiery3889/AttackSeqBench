### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading.
- It drops a decoy document, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll, and the PIVY shellcode file as Active.dat in a directory named ActiveUpdate_[0-9]{3}.
- It copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and executes the new file with the path to the DLL.
- It installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.

**Execution:**
- The PIVY variant copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and executes the new file with the path to the DLL to perform its malicious actions.

**Persistence:**
- The PIVY variant installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL and perform its malicious actions.
- The malware's configuration has been modified to confuse some publicly available tools that parse the configuration data.
- The C2s are no longer null-padded, and each hostname ends with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each C2 server.

**Others:**
- PIVY samples were observed targeting Myanmar and several other countries in Asia.
- The targeting of post-election Myanmar appears to be following the same style as what was mentioned in the "Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger" paper by ASERT.
- A possible connection exists given that the C2 for these samples resolved to an IP contained within 103.240.203.0/22, as did a 9002 RAT sample in the Seven Pointed Dagger exploitation campaign.
- A "LURK0" Gh0strat and another PIVY domain were also observed to have resolved to IPs contained within this range, making this subnet more suspicious from a targeted attack perspective.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the PIVY variant evades defenses by using DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL and modifying its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data, is it likely that the malware will communicate with Command & Control (C2) servers such as webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com using application layer protocols?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection.
- The C2 servers are described as having hostnames that end with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each C2 server.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that the C2 servers are no longer null-padded and have a specific structure in their hostnames.
- The question asks if the malware is likely to communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
- Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) are commonly used by malware to communicate with C2 servers.
- The report does not explicitly state that the PIVY variant does not use application layer protocols for C2 communication.
- Given the nature of C2 communication in malware, it is highly likely that the PIVY variant uses application layer protocols to communicate with its C2 servers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection.
- The C2 servers have a specific structure in their hostnames, which is consistent with the use of application layer protocols.
- Malware typically uses application layer protocols for C2 communication to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
- The report does not provide any information suggesting that the PIVY variant does not use application layer protocols for C2 communication.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
