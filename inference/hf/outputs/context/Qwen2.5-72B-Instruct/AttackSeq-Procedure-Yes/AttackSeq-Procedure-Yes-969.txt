### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop a loader.
     - Archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Aria-body loader uses 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Some variants inject themselves into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - C&C servers operate within limited daily windows.
     - Fileless loading techniques and frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:**
     - Aria-body backdoor can create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.
     - Sends collected data to the C&C domain with an XORed password.
     - Listens for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor, after achieving persistence and injecting itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe', is likely to gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Injection:**
     - The report clearly states that the Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key and can inject itself into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Collection Capabilities:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor has the capability to collect OS information, which includes details about the installed software and Windows version.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The collection capabilities of the Aria-body backdoor align with the need to gather information about the victim's machine for discovery purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to establish persistence and inject itself into processes.
   - Once persistence is established and the backdoor is active, it has the capability to collect various types of information, including OS information.
   - Collecting OS information is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
