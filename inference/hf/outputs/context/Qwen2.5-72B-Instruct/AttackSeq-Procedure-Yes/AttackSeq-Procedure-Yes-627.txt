### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The malware is delivered via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
- Upon execution, the HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file.
- Simultaneously, it executes a backdoor in the background.
- The malware installer uses embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload.
- Techniques are employed to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware minimizes the script window and avoids the display of the window taskbar.
- It uses obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files.
- It checks for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence.

**Others:**
- The malware campaign is suspected to be backed by a group with a significant budget.
- The campaign aims to spy on specific individuals opposed to a country's political methods.
- The malware is designed to appear as a common threat but employs sophisticated techniques for spying.
- The campaign has been active since at least 2009.
- The domains used by the malware for command and control have a history of phishing and malware distribution.
- The investigation is ongoing.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering the malware via 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta' and executing the embedded VB Script to drop and open a decoy Microsoft Word file, is it likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malware delivered via 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - Execution of 'Thumoi.hta' drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file.
   - Simultaneous execution of a backdoor in the background.
   - Use of embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Minimizing the script window and avoiding the display of the window taskbar.
   - Obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files.
   - Checking for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
- The CTI report mentions that the malware uses obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files, which aligns with the idea of rewriting itself with a randomized Hex-filename.
- The report also mentions that the malware checks for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence, which suggests that it may move or rewrite itself to a different location to maintain persistence.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the defense evasion techniques described in the report, such as obfuscation and ensuring persistence.
- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described techniques and the overall sophistication of the malware.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the malware uses sophisticated techniques for defense evasion, including obfuscation and ensuring persistence.
- The described techniques of minimizing visibility, avoiding detection, and ensuring persistence strongly suggest that the malware would take steps to rewrite itself and execute in a new process to maintain its presence on the system.
- The use of a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension in the %Temp% folder is a common technique for evading detection and maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
