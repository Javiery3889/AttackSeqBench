### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
     - Initial reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
     - Second spear phish containing a remote template to deliver a payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - Use remote templates in Microsoft Word to load an external template.
   - **Persistence:**
     - POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
     - Use POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make analysis harder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server, sending system information and receiving instructions.
     - Enters a communications loop after a reboot.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Inception attackers are likely to deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.
     - This step is mentioned after the initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make analysis harder suggests that POWERSHOWER is deployed early in the attack.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - Initial Access (exploit CVE-2017-11882) → Deployment of POWERSHOWER → Establishment of Persistence

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the attackers use POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make analysis harder, which suggests that POWERSHOWER is deployed early in the attack.
   - The persistence mechanism is set up by POWERSHOWER, which implies that POWERSHOWER must be deployed before the persistence is established.
   - The sequence of events in the report supports the idea that POWERSHOWER is deployed before the persistence is set up.
