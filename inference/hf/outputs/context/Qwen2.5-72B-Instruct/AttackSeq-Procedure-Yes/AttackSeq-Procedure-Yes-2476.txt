### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Acquired domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org).
     - Developed capabilities including Graphite malware and Empire tools.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx).
     - Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Executed malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects.
     - Created a local account (net user /add user1).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel.
     - Used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.
     - Employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) for client execution before using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions the use of reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report indicates the use of multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel and the use of an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report aligns with the question. The attackers first exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability to gain initial access, and then used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to execute the malicious payload.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute the Empire stager is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it is a common technique for executing stagers and maintaining command and control.
