### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government.
- The attack exploited an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) using a link to a Flash exploit hosted on `rpt.perrydale[.]com` and `report.perrydale[.]com`.
- The domains resolved to a Ukrainian IP 194.44.130.179, likely through DNS hijacking.
- The exploit files were located at `rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf` and `report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf`.
- The exploit retrieved a secondary payload, `b.gif`, from the same domains.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malicious Flash file `show.swf` attempted to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode to install a payload.
- The payload was embedded in an animated GIF image, `b.gif`.
- The payload was not weaponized as it lacked an encrypted payload, possibly due to UPS's tactic of serving payloads only within limited time windows and to specific victim profiles.

**Others:**
- The attack shares similarities with a previous targeted attack attributed to the APT group known as UPS or APT3.
- The ActionScript classes and log messages in the malicious Flash files indicate attribution to UPS.
- The payload extraction and decryption technique from an animated GIF image was also used in the CVE-2015-3113 attacks.
- The shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 were found to be 99% similar.
- The attacks demonstrate how APT groups like UPS quickly leverage new vulnerabilities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the spear-phishing attack exploits the Adobe Flash vulnerability through the links `rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf` and `report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf` for initial access, is it likely that the Flash exploit `show.swf` will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image `b.gif`?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spear-phishing attack with a link to a Flash exploit.
   - The Flash exploit is hosted on `rpt.perrydale[.]com` and `report.perrydale[.]com`.
   - The exploit files are `rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf` and `report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf`.

2. **Execution of Shellcode:**
   - The Flash file `show.swf` attempts to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode.

3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The shellcode is used to install a payload.
   - The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image, `b.gif`.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report clearly states that the Flash file `show.swf` attempts to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode.
  - The shellcode is used to install a payload, which is embedded in an animated GIF image, `b.gif`.
  - This sequence aligns with the typical TTPs of APT groups like UPS, which use sophisticated techniques to evade defenses.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the Flash exploit does not execute shellcode or that the payload is not embedded in an animated GIF image, which contradicts the information provided in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the Flash file `show.swf` attempts to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode.
- The shellcode is used to install a payload, which is embedded in an animated GIF image, `b.gif`.
- This sequence is consistent with the TTPs of APT groups like UPS, which use sophisticated techniques to evade defenses.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
