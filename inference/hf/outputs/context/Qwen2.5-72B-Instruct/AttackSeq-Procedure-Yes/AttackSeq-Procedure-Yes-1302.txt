### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
   - **Command and Control:** The stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043, T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SWEEDâ€™s malware, `educrety.exe`, will drop a PE file before using credential dumping techniques to search for OS credentials in registry keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Software Packing and File Deletion:** The report mentions that the threat used T1045 (Software Packing) and T1107 (File Deletion) for defense evasion. This aligns with the question's mention of software packing and file deletion.
   - **Dropping a PE File:** The report mentions a dropped PE file with a specific hash, indicating that the malware does indeed drop a PE file.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The report does not explicitly mention credential dumping techniques, but it does mention the collection of data from the local system (T1005), which could include credentials. Additionally, the use of LokiBot, a known malware that can steal credentials, suggests that credential dumping is a likely part of the attack.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms that the malware drops a PE file and uses software packing and file deletion for defense evasion.
   - The collection of data from the local system and the use of LokiBot suggest that credential dumping is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - Given the context and the known capabilities of the malware, it is reasonable to infer that the malware would drop a PE file and then proceed to search for OS credentials in registry keys.
