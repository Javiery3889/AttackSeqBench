### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader that employs ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
- The script is hosted on Discord CDNs and downloaded from a specific URL.

**Persistence:**
- A VBScript named `Login1.vbs` is placed in the Startup folder.
- This script ensures the execution of `SystemLogin.bat` upon system startup.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The PowerShell script includes an AMSI bypass method.
- Scripts and registry values are obfuscated to evade detection.

**Command and Control:**
- The final PowerShell script leads to njRAT, a remote access tool (RAT).

**Others:**
- Additional context about the threat actor, including their targets and techniques.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN, Blind Eagle will:
- Use PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass.
- Achieve persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report confirms that Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN to execute PowerShell commands.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report mentions that the PowerShell script includes an AMSI bypass method. However, it does not explicitly state that PowerShell is used to load DLLs. The AMSI bypass is a defense evasion technique, but the specific method of loading DLLs is not mentioned.

**Persistence:**
- The report confirms that a VBScript named `Login1.vbs` is placed in the Startup folder to ensure the execution of `SystemLogin.bat` upon system startup.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access:** Confirmed.
- **Defense Evasion:** Confirmed (AMSI bypass), but the specific method of loading DLLs is not mentioned.
- **Persistence:** Confirmed.

The question asks if it is likely that Blind Eagle will use PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass before achieving persistence. While the report confirms the use of PowerShell for AMSI bypass and the placement of a VBScript in the Startup folder, it does not explicitly state that PowerShell is used to load DLLs.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Blind Eagle will use PowerShell for AMSI bypass and achieve persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder. However, the specific method of loading DLLs is not confirmed.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
