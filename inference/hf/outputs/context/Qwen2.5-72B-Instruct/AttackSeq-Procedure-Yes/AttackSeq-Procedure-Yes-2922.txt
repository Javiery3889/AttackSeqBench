### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT41 targets call record information and hotel reservation systems, particularly ahead of Chinese officials' stays.
   - **Initial Access:** APT41 uses spear-phishing emails with .chm files.
   - **Execution:** APT41 deploys various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.
   - **Persistence:** APT41 uses rootkits and MBR bootkits.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT41 uses bootkits for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** APT41 uses credential stealers and keyloggers.
   - **Discovery:** APT41 moves laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, to discover and access game production environments.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until accessing game production environments.
   - **Impact:** APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and has attempted to deploy ransomware in the video game industry for financial gain.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that APT41 collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments after moving laterally within targeted networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevance of Lateral Movement and Discovery:** The report clearly states that APT41 moves laterally within networks and accesses game production environments. This aligns with the question's context.
   - **Objective of APT41:** The report mentions that APT41 is involved in state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated operations. Collecting source code and digital certificates would be valuable assets for both espionage and financial gain.
   - **Impact:** The report mentions that APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and attempts to deploy ransomware in the video game industry. Source code and digital certificates are valuable assets that can be used for further attacks, such as creating more sophisticated malware or selling on the black market.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT41's activities are multifaceted, involving both espionage and financial gain.
   - The group's ability to move laterally and access game production environments suggests a high level of sophistication and a clear objective to gather valuable information.
   - Source code and digital certificates are highly valuable assets in the context of both espionage and financial gain. Source code can be used to understand and exploit vulnerabilities, while digital certificates can be used to sign malware, making it appear legitimate.
   - Given APT41's history of deploying ransomware and manipulating virtual currencies, it is reasonable to infer that they would also collect source code and digital certificates to further their objectives.
