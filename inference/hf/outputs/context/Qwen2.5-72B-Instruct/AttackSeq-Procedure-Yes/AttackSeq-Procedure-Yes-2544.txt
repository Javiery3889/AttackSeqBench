### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda targeted multiple sectors using the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Used PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
   - **Discovery:** Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server and supports a command to send information about current sessions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Milestone backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:** The report explicitly states that the Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** The report mentions that the Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server and supports a command to send information about current sessions.
   - **Exfiltration:** While the report does not explicitly state that the backdoor exfiltrates data after discovery, the combination of discovery capabilities and C2 communication strongly suggests that the backdoor is designed to exfiltrate the discovered data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:** The Milestone backdoor can discover system information and capture the screen.
   - **C2 Communication:** The backdoor communicates with a C2 server and can send information about current sessions.
   - **Logical Inference:** Given that the backdoor has the capability to discover and capture data and can communicate with a C2 server, it is highly likely that it will exfiltrate the discovered data to the C2 server.
