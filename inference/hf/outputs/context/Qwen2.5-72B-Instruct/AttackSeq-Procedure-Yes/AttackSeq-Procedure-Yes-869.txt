### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - GreyEnergy targets energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland.
     - Activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password and credential stealing.
     - Targets ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Modular malware framework with espionage and reconnaissance purposes.
     - Mini backdoor deployed before admin rights are obtained.
     - C&C servers are active Tor relays.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Two infection vectors: spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
     - Lateral movement from compromised web servers to other workstations.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Use of common external tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Deploy internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether GreyEnergy is likely to gain initial access through vectors such as spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that GreyEnergy uses two distinct infection vectors: spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers.
     - These vectors are used to gain initial access to the target network.
   - **Stealth Techniques:**
     - The report mentions that GreyEnergy employs various stealth techniques, including the use of internal C&C proxies and partial AES-256 encryption of modules.
     - These techniques are used to maintain persistence and evade detection after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - GreyEnergy gains initial access through spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers.
   - **Stealth Techniques:**
     - Once initial access is gained, GreyEnergy deploys internal C&C proxies and uses partial AES-256 encryption of modules to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The logical sequence is that GreyEnergy first gains initial access and then employs stealth techniques to maintain and expand its presence in the network.
