### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating hidden directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via a custom TCP-based protocol with compressed and encrypted messages.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The CTI report explicitly states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.
   - **Communication with C&C Servers:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of non-standard ports, but it does indicate that the communication is custom and involves TCP messages, which suggests a high likelihood of using non-standard ports to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration.
   - The use of non-standard ports is a common technique to evade detection and is implied by the custom nature of the protocol.
   - The exfiltration process involves compressed and encrypted TCP messages, which aligns with the question.
