### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign gathered information through job recruitment activities.
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents with a macro were distributed, which injected the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
   - **Execution:** The macro executed shellcode that downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control:** The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with data encrypted and obfuscated.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted and obfuscated before being exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control:** The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with data encrypted and obfuscated.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention that the implant fetches computer name and user name information. However, it is common for malware to gather such information as part of its initial discovery activities to provide context to the attackers.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the Rising Sun implant fetches computer name and user name information, it is a common practice in malware to gather such information. This information is crucial for the attackers to understand the environment they are operating in and to tailor their actions accordingly.
   - The implant's capabilities include executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. Fetching computer name and user name information would be a logical step in the discovery phase to provide context for these actions.
   - Given the sophistication of the implant and its capabilities, it is highly likely that it would perform such discovery activities.
