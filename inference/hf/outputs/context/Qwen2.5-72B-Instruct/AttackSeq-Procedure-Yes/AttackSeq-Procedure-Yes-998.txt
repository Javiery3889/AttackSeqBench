### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing email from UPS.
     - Link to SharePoint URL.
     - Downloaded ZIP file containing a VBS script.
     - VBS script dropped a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Execution:**
     - JavaScript backdoor connected to sephardimension[.]com.
     - Installed CARBANAK RAT on domain controllers.
     - Obfuscated script downloaded and executed, loading a DLL file in memory.
     - CARBANAK RAT connected to 170.130.55[.]85:443 to download anunak_config.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Escalation attempts in Active Directory.
     - Used RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
     - PowerShell RAT connected to hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Deployed Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
     - Lasted about a week.
     - Conducted from a different infrastructure.
   - **Collection:**
     - Exfiltrated data using SmartFTP Client.
     - Connected to an IP address controlled by the attacker.
     - Files exfiltrated listed in "Unlocker-List.txt".
   - **Command and Control:**
     - CARBANAK RAT beaconed to 170.130.55[.]85:443.
     - PowerShell RAT communicated with hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.
   - **Impact:**
     - Deployed RYUK ransomware a week after reconnaissance and data exfiltration.
     - Used batch files to disable protections and security software.
     - Remote code execution using remote WMI command execution and PsExec.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attacker would connect to an IP address controlled by them using the SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data during the third stage of the attack (the Discovery stage).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that during the Discovery stage, the attacker deployed Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - The report also mentions that the data exfiltration was conducted using the SmartFTP Client, which connected to an IP address controlled by the attacker.
   - The Discovery stage is described as lasting about a week and being conducted from a different infrastructure than the first two stages.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Discovery stage involved the use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - The Collection stage, which follows the Discovery stage, involved the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client.
   - The report explicitly states that the SmartFTP Client was used to exfiltrate data to an IP address controlled by the attacker.
   - The use of different infrastructure for the Discovery stage aligns with the attacker's operational security practices, making it plausible that they would use a controlled IP address for exfiltration.
