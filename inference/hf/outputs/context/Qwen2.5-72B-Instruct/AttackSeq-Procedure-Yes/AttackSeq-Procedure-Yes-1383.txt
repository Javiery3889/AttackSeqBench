### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance:**
  - **Tools Used:**
    - **Masscan:** To identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
    - **Shodan and Censys:** To find publicly available resources of medical organizations.
  - **Discoveries:**
    - **Non-trivial Ports and Services:**
      - Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol.
      - Printers with web interfaces without authentication.
    - **Context:**
      - These discoveries suggest that the reconnaissance efforts are successful in identifying various services and devices on the network perimeters.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After identifying potential entry points into medical infrastructure using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance, is it likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the CTI Report:**
  - The report explicitly mentions the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems and printers with web interfaces without authentication.
  - These discoveries are made using the same tools (masscan, Shodan, and Censys) mentioned in the question.
  - The report also highlights the presence of outdated systems and medical devices, which are often part of the network perimeters in medical organizations.

- **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
  - **Choice A: Yes**
    - This choice aligns with the report's findings. The use of masscan, Shodan, and Censys for reconnaissance is likely to uncover various services, including outdated systems and medical devices.
  - **Choice B: No**
    - This choice contradicts the report's findings. The report clearly indicates that such services and devices are discovered during the reconnaissance phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report provides detailed evidence that the use of masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance leads to the discovery of various services and devices on the network perimeters.
  - These discoveries include non-trivial ports, services, and devices, which are often outdated or poorly secured.
  - Therefore, it is highly likely that the reconnaissance efforts will uncover such services and devices.

- **Final Answer:**
  - Final Answer: A: Yes
