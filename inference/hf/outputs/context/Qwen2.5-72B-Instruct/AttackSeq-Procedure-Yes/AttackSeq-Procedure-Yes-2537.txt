### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access through the Log4Shell vulnerability, spawning PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server and supports commands to send session information.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **Others:** Attribution to Deep Panda and Winnti based on the use of Milestone backdoor and Fire Chili rootkit, and the use of stolen certificates and C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Discovery:** The report clearly states that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence and then proceeds with system information discovery and screen capture.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly mention the deployment of the Fire Chili rootkit or the use of DKOM for defense evasion. However, it does mention that the Fire Chili rootkit is associated with Deep Panda and Winnti.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report provides a clear sequence of actions: persistence, privilege escalation, discovery, and command and control. There is no indication that the Fire Chili rootkit is deployed between persistence and discovery.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that the Fire Chili rootkit is deployed after ensuring persistence and before system information discovery and screen capture.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report is logical and does not suggest an additional step of deploying the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion at that specific point.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
