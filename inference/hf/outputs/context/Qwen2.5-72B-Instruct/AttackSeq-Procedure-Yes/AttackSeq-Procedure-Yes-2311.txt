### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and relies on scheduled tasks for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and moves laterally to systems with domain admins logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
   - **Collection:** The adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online, and exfiltrates it via company portals and VPNs.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary will use custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage web services after collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that the adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online, and exfiltrates it via company portals and VPNs.
   - **Exfiltration Method:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of custom-built malware for exfiltration. Instead, it focuses on the use of company portals and VPNs for exfiltration.
   - **Cobalt Strike:** The adversary heavily relies on Cobalt Strike, which has built-in capabilities for data exfiltration. Cobalt Strike can exfiltrate data over various protocols, including HTTPS, which is more common and less likely to raise suspicion compared to custom-built malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary has a well-defined method for exfiltration using Cobalt Strike and company portals/VPNs.
   - There is no mention of custom-built malware in the report.
   - Using Cobalt Strike for exfiltration is more efficient and less likely to be detected compared to custom-built malware.
   - The adversary's focus on using existing tools and methods suggests they prefer to avoid the additional risk and complexity of custom-built malware.
