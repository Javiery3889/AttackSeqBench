### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document.
- The RTF document downloaded an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.

**Execution:**
- The HTA file contained a script that checked for installed antivirus software using WMI.
- If no specific antivirus software was detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WinSrv.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and instead used VBS.
- The backdoor employed DLL sideloading using cmpbk32.dll to execute Srvstr.exe.

**Discovery:**
- The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.

**Others:**
- Various IOCs were identified, including hashes for files and the domain webserv-redir.net.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using WMI to check for installed antivirus software and avoiding PowerShell execution during defense evasion, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy
- B: T1082-System Information Discovery
- C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The HTA file used WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
- The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and instead used VBS.
- The backdoor communicated with the C2 server.

**Evaluating the Answer Choices:**

- **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of the communication. The report does not mention any multi-hop proxy setup.

- **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering system information, which the HTA file did using WMI to check for antivirus software. However, this does not specifically address sending information to the C2 server.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. The report mentions that the backdoor communicated with the C2 server, which aligns with this technique.

- **D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access to resources. The report does not mention any hybrid identity techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The HTA file used WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
- The backdoor communicated with the C2 server using the domain webserv-redir.net.
- The most likely technique for sending information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server is using a standard application layer protocol, which is described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
