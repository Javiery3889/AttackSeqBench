### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
- **Resource Development**: The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
- **Initial Access**: Gained through phishing emails.
- **Execution**: The malware executes by running a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses Base64 encoding and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop.
- **Credential Access**: Steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
- **Discovery**: Collects system information, running processes, open ports, and data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
- **Collection**: Collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, browser bookmarks and cookies, chat history, and data from removable media.
- **Command and Control**: Communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
- **Exfiltration**: Uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure the malware runs at startup using `rundll32.exe`.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)**: This technique involves injecting code into a process using APCs, which is not directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
- **T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking COM objects, which is not directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
- **T1119 - Automated Collection**: This technique involves automated data collection, which is not related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
- **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves various methods to ensure that the malware runs at startup, including using `rundll32.exe`.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about ensuring the malware runs at startup using `rundll32.exe`.
- The most relevant technique for this is **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.
- `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that can be used to run code at startup, and it is a common method for malware to ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
