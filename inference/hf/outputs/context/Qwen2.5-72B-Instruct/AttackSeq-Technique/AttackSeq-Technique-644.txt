### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: Both Moafee and DragonOK used similar TTPs, including custom-built backdoors and RATs like CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy. They also used HTRAN to disguise their geographical location.
- **Initial Access**: The primary attack vector was spear-phishing emails with well-crafted, tailored content and executable files or password-protected documents.
- **Execution**: Evasion techniques included environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents. The 'CPU core check' technique was used to detect virtualized environments.
- **Persistence**: Registry entries were used to ensure startup persistence, with different entries based on the OS version.
- **Defense Evasion**: Techniques included environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents. The 'CPU core check' technique and large null-padded files were used to evade detection.
- **Command and Control**: The NewCT RAT used a 'POST' network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data, and had plugin functionality.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that describes the activity where Moafee and DragonOK ensure the deployment of tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs to support their campaigns.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malware, which is not mentioned in the CTI report.
- **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves acquiring tools, exploits, malware, and other capabilities to support the campaign. The CTI report mentions the use of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique involves altering or defacing internal systems, which is not mentioned in the CTI report.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is already described in the CTI report but does not cover the deployment of tools.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report clearly states that both Moafee and DragonOK used custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs to maintain access to victim networks. This aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1588-Obtain Capabilities, which involves acquiring the necessary tools and capabilities to support the campaign.
- The other answer choices do not fit the context of the CTI report as well as T1588.

**Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
