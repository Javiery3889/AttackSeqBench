### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests the attackers had detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers acquired and parked domains for future use.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access through a compromised software update.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies the attackers maintained their foothold but does not specify techniques.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access but does not specify techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network but does not specify techniques.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1568 Dynamic Resolution.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage, not destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred as the threat actors executed code using system services after gaining initial access through a compromised software update.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying running processes, which is a discovery technique. It is not directly related to executing code using system services.
   - **T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves removing persistence mechanisms, which is not relevant to executing code using system services.
   - **T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:** This technique involves using scripting languages to execute code, but it is not specifically related to system services.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves executing code through system services, which aligns with the question's context of using system services to execute code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gained initial access through a compromised software update (T1195.002).
   - After gaining access, the next logical step would be to execute code to establish a foothold and perform further actions.
   - The technique T1569-System Services is specifically about executing code through system services, which fits the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services
