### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- **T1583.003**: Compromise Infrastructure (Virtual Private Server)
- **T1584**: Compromise Infrastructure (Hosting malware C2s)

**Initial Access:**
- **T1566**: Phishing
- **T1566.001**: Spearphishing Attachment (Emails with a PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT)

**Execution:**
- **T1204**: User Execution
- **T1204.002**: Malicious File (Malicious DLL loaded via DLL Hijacking)

**Persistence:**
- **T1547.001**: Registry Run Keys
- **T1574.001**: DLL Search Order Hijacking
- **T1574.002**: DLL Side-Loading (Malicious DLL loaded via DLL Hijacking into a legitimate binary)

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW (Mark of the Web) after using HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**HTML Smuggling:**
- HTML Smuggling is a technique where attackers embed malicious content within HTML files, which are then used to bypass security controls. This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI report, but it is a plausible method for delivering ENVYSCOUT.

**MOTW (Mark of the Web):**
- MOTW is a security feature that tags files downloaded from the internet to prevent them from being executed without user interaction. To ensure that malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW, attackers often use techniques to subvert trust controls or manipulate file attributes.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware, which is not directly related to bypassing MOTW.
- **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to host malware, which is mentioned in the CTI report but does not directly address bypassing MOTW.
- **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls, which can include manipulating file attributes to avoid security checks, such as removing MOTW.
- **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves using resource forks to hide malicious content, which is not directly related to bypassing MOTW.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **HTML Smuggling** is used to bypass security controls and deliver ENVYSCOUT.
- To ensure that the malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW, the attackers need to subvert trust controls.
- **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves manipulating file attributes and trust mechanisms to avoid security checks.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
