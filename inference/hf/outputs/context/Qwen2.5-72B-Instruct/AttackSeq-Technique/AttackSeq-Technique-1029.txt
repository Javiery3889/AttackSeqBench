### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
- Abusing compromised organization's email accounts to send emails with malicious attachments.

**Execution:**
- Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript).
- Use of rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs.
- Use of CreateProcess to launch additional components.
- User execution of malicious email attachments for initial compromise.

**Persistence:**
- Registering modules as scheduled tasks.
- Using Registry Run keys and the Startup folder.
- Inserting malicious macros into existing documents.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Obfuscation of files or information.
- Modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
- Code signing with valid certificates.
- Deobfuscation and decryption of strings.
- Adding remote templates to documents.
- Using the C# compiler module with an obfuscated downloader.

**Discovery:**
- Backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Injecting malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents.
- Using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets.

**Command and Control:**
- Using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

**Exfiltration:**
- Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
After Gamaredon used its backdoor to automatically list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares?

**Answer Choices:**
A: T1596.002-WHOIS
B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
C: T1119-Automated Collection
D: T1213.001-Confluence

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery Phase:**
- The report states that the backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.

**Exfiltration Phase:**
- The modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1596.002-WHOIS** - This technique involves querying WHOIS databases to gather information about domain names and IP addresses. It is not related to gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, or network shares.
- **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as modifying security settings or bypassing security mechanisms. It is not directly related to gathering sensitive documents.
- **C: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system, which aligns with the backdoor listing interesting files and the modules uploading harvested documents.
- **D: T1213.001-Confluence** - This technique involves using Confluence, a collaboration and documentation tool, which is not relevant to the context of gathering sensitive documents.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.
- The modules then automatically upload these harvested documents to the C&C server.
- The technique that best describes this automated process of collecting and exfiltrating sensitive documents is **T1119-Automated Collection**.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1119-Automated Collection
