### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using a PowerShell one-liner and relies on scheduled tasks for executing batch files.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms but uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin credentials and moves laterally to systems with domain admins logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to hide their activities.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access to accounts.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover accounts and other information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement methods (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM) to move to domain controllers and other systems.
   - **Collection:** The adversary collects data from various sources, including SharePoint, file shares, and email.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's C2 protocol, initially encapsulated in DNS and later in HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and larger amounts using a custom tool to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which MITRE ATT&CK technique facilitated the tactic of gaining access to the victim's VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points after credential stuffing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves the use of legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. The CTI report mentions that the adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access to accounts, which aligns with this technique.
   - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules:** This technique involves hiding email rules to evade detection. The CTI report does not mention any use of email hiding rules.
   - **T1200-Hardware Additions:** This technique involves adding hardware to gain access. The CTI report does not mention any hardware additions.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering system information. While the adversary does perform discovery, this technique is not directly related to gaining access to network entry points.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access to accounts.
   - Once they have valid credentials, they use these to access the victim's VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points.
   - The technique that best describes the use of valid credentials to gain access is T1078-Valid Accounts.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts
