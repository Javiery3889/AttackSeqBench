### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email.
- The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

**Execution:**
- Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence and executed commands via scripts.
- Additional variants of Pterodo were executed on July 16.
- A VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload on July 28.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Shuckworm used mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
- They used scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection and maintain their foothold.

**Collection:**
- Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.
- It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Command and Control:**
- Shuckworm established command and control by communicating with their servers using HTTP requests and downloading additional payloads.
- They used various C&C servers to control the compromised systems and download tools.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has been tracking Shuckworm's activities.
- Shuckworm has been active since at least 2013 and has increased the sophistication of their attacks.
- The SSU reported that Shuckworm has been using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks.
- Symantec's investigation revealed seven files used by Shuckworm, including VBS files, a VNC client, and a Process Explorer binary.
- The IOCs showed patterns such as C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers and suspected malicious files found in specific directories with names starting with the letter 'd'.
- The SSU report attributed over 5,000 attacks to Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Shuckworm utilized malicious documents to execute their Pterodo backdoor and scheduled tasks to support their foothold, which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured the backdoor remained active across system reboots?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
- B: T1098-Account Manipulation
- C: T1204.003-Malicious Image
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Details from the CTI Report:**
- Shuckworm created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- They used VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the backdoor is executed automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This aligns with the report's mention of scheduled tasks and VBS scripts used to maintain persistence.
- **B: T1098-Account Manipulation**
  - This technique involves altering account settings to maintain access. While it can be used for persistence, it is not specifically mentioned in the report.
- **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**
  - This technique involves using malicious images to execute code. It is not mentioned in the report and does not align with the described attack sequence.
- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute code. While it is mentioned in the report, it is not specifically tied to ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that Shuckworm used scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- Scheduled tasks are a common method to achieve boot or logon autostart execution, which ensures that the backdoor remains active across system reboots.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the specific technique used to maintain persistence across reboots.

**Final Answer:**
A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
