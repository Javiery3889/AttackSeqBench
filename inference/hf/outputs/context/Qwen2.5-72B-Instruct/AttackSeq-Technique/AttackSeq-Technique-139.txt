### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The APT-TOCS attack used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
- A binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe".

**Execution:**
- The attack involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities and executing them in memory.
- Communication via Beacon mode, sending network heartbeat packages every 60 seconds, and transmitting data information via the Cookie field.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack pattern included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication to evade detection.

**Lateral Movement:**
- APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network as required.

**Others:**
- APT-TOCS is related to Cobalt Strike and is capable of evading various detection methods.
- The attack is considered an APT due to its targeted nature, anti-detection functions, and ability to conceal itself.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by APT-TOCS to establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs after downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell and maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1654-Log Enumeration** - This technique involves adversaries enumerating log files to find information that might be useful for follow-on objectives. It does not fit the context of establishing secure communication.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While PowerShell is used in the attack, this choice does not specifically address secure communication.
- **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** - This sub-technique involves using symmetric cryptography to protect data in transit. While it could be used for secure communication, the report does not specifically mention symmetric cryptography.
- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications. The report mentions multi-beacon communication and transmitting data information via the Cookie field, which suggests the use of encrypted channels to secure communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The attack involves downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell and maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion.
- The report mentions that the attack pattern includes communication via Beacon mode and transmitting data information via the Cookie field, which implies the use of secure communication channels.
- The most plausible technique for establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
