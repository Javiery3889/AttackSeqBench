### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **T1566 (Phishing):** The attackers used phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit and mailings with attachments containing malicious macros to distribute the Raccoon stealer.

**Execution:**
- **T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter):** The Raccoon stealer, once executed, collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers. It also scans for valid crypto wallets and gains access to configuration files.
- **T1003 (OS Credential Dumping):** The stealer collects account data, which can include credentials.
- **T1082 (System Information Discovery):** The stealer collects system information.

**Command and Control:**
- **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol):** The Raccoon stealer communicated with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection.
- **T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer):** The C&C servers were encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.

**Others:**
- The campaign was divided into four stages based on the tools used.
- Most domains related to the campaign were registered with two registrars: Cloud2m and Host Africa.
- The attackers also distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar using malicious macros and phishing pages.
- The domains used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data were registered during the second wave with the same registrars as the domains discovered while investigating the malicious campaign.
- The attackers experimented with various loaders, including Buer and Smoke loaders.
- The campaign's purpose was to steal payment and user data.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "After the Raccoon stealer was executed to collect data such as system information, account data, and crypto wallet details, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before it bypassed blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **T1566 (Phishing):** This technique is used for initial access, not for communication with C&C servers.
- **T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information):** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It could be relevant for the initial stages of the attack but not specifically for the communication with C&C servers.
- **T1222.001 (Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification):** This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions, which is not directly related to network communication or C&C server interaction.
- **T1010 (Application Window Discovery):** This technique involves discovering application windows, which is not relevant to the communication with C&C servers.

The most relevant technique for the communication with C&C servers is **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)**, which involves using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before the stealer bypassed blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.

Given the context, the most likely technique that occurred before the stealer made network requests to the Telegram channel is **T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information)**. This is because the C&C server addresses were encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel, and obfuscation is a common technique to protect these addresses from detection.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
