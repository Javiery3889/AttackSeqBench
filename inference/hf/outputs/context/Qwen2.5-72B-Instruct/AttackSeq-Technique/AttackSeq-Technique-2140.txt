### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Date:** November 27, 2020
- **Threat Actor:** AridViper (APT-C-23 / GnatSpy)
- **Malware Delivery:** Malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae, likely part of a phishing campaign.
- **Malware Execution:** Once executed, the malware made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

**Others:**
- Passive DNS data revealed that most hostnames are associated with NAMECHEAP-NET in the US, except for camilleoconnell[.]website, which is associated with UCOM ARTERIA Networks Corporation in Japan.
- Use of NameCheap infrastructure has been previously observed in AridViper's activities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before additional C2 domains such as jack-fruit[.]club and camilleoconnell[.]website were identified through pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to establish communication with the initial C2 domain judystevenson[.]info?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1001.001-Junk Data
- B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks
- C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- D: T1566-Phishing

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Phishing Campaign:** Malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae is sent to the target.
2. **Malware Execution:** The target opens the document, and the malware is executed.
3. **C2 Communication:** The malware makes a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the content of the communication. It is not directly related to establishing initial C2 communication.
- **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks:** This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. It is not relevant to the initial C2 communication described in the report.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with the C2 server. The report mentions that the malware made a POST request, which is an application layer protocol.
- **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver the malware. While it is part of the initial access, it is not the technique used to establish communication with the C2 domain.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that the malware, once executed, made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.
- A POST request is an application layer protocol, which aligns with the T1071 technique.
- The other techniques (T1001.001, T1595.001, and T1566) do not directly relate to the establishment of C2 communication.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
