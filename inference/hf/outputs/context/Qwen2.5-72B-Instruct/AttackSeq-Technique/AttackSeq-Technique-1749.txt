### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- TG1021 identified targets using reconnaissance techniques.

**Initial Access:**
- TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

**Execution:**
- TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.

**Persistence:**
- TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) to maintain persistence. They also removed disk-resident tools after use for stealth.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation, including dynamic DLL loading, code injection, and token manipulation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and used in-memory execution to avoid detection.

**Credential Access:**
- TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials and save them in clear text.

**Discovery:**
- TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, loading them directly into memory and deleting output files after use.

**Command and Control:**
- TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, using NodeIISWeb for backdoor functionality.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used during TG1021's lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network, after employing PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance and leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves gathering information about cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the described lateral movement.
- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering identity information, which is more related to credential access rather than lateral movement.
- **C: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the described use of compromised domain credentials and SMB to access shared folders.
- **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which is not relevant to the described IIS server environment.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
  - TG1021 used PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance, which helped in mapping the network and identifying potential targets.
- **Credential Access:**
  - TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials, which were likely used for lateral movement.
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - The use of compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB indicates that TG1021 was moving laterally within the network.
- **Remote Services:**
  - The most relevant technique for this type of lateral movement is T1021-Remote Services, which includes using SMB to access shared resources.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
