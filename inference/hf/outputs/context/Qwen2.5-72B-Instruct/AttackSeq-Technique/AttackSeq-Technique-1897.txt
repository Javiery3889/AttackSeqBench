### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumps LSASS process memory, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when FIN13 targeted web-accessible directories to steal the staged data after collecting and archiving it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which aligns with targeting web-accessible directories to steal data.
   - **T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing input from the graphical user interface, which is not relevant to exfiltrating data from web-accessible directories.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is more related to initial access rather than exfiltration.
   - **T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over USB, which is not relevant to web-accessible directories.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FIN13 collects and archives data from network shared drives.
   - The next logical step is to exfiltrate the data.
   - Given that the data is staged in web-accessible directories, the most plausible technique is exfiltration over web services (T1567).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
