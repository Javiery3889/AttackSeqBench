### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The Inception Framework used RTF files with embedded malware to exploit vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) and gain remote access via spear phishing emails.
- **Weaponized Documents**: These documents contained two separate exploits, triggering the execution of the malicious payload upon opening.
- **Operational Security**: The attackers used a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts to interact with their infrastructure, maintaining a high level of operational security.
- **Malware Sophistication**: The malware was sophisticated, with multiple layers of obfuscation and polymorphic techniques to evade detection.
- **Targeting**: The framework targeted various sectors and used mobile malware disguised as updates for popular messaging applications and MMS phishing content.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files to gain remote access via spear phishing, which ATT&CK technique most likely followed to facilitate communication between the malware and the framework's cloud infrastructure?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1566-Phishing
  - B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path
  - C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy
  - D: T1102-Web Service

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique is used for initial access, which has already been described in the report. It is not relevant for facilitating communication after initial access.
- **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves manipulating the system path to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to communication with a cloud infrastructure.
- **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic, which aligns with the report's mention of a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts. This could be used to maintain operational security and facilitate communication.
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. Given the sophistication of the malware and the use of cloud infrastructure, this is a plausible technique for maintaining communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear phishing emails containing weaponized RTF files that exploit vulnerabilities to gain remote access.
- **Communication**: After gaining access, the malware needs to communicate with the framework's cloud infrastructure. The report mentions a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts, which suggests the use of multi-hop proxies (T1090.003) to maintain operational security.
- **Sophistication**: The malware is sophisticated and uses multiple layers of obfuscation, which aligns with the use of web services (T1102) to communicate with the C2 server, as it can blend in with normal traffic and evade detection.

Given the high level of operational security and the need to maintain communication with the cloud infrastructure, the most plausible technique is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
