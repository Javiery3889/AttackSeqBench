### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
- **Execution**: The threat actors uploaded a variety of tools to the compromised servers, including legitimate applications and post-exploitation tools like Mimikatz. They also uploaded custom backdoors such as HyperBro.
- **Persistence**: The actors installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence. These included the Antak webshell, a variant of the China Chopper webshell, and other related webshells.
- **Defense Evasion**: Emissary Panda used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading, running malicious DLLs with code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks. They also used the China Chopper webshell to maintain access and evade defenses.
- **Credential Access**: The actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials, which were then used to pivot to additional systems within the network.
- **Discovery**: The threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance, identifying vulnerable systems and gathering information to facilitate lateral movement.
- **Lateral Movement**: Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
- **Command and Control**: The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control, configured to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS (hxxps://185.12.45[.]134:443/ajax).

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks: "Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Emissary Panda leveraged Active Scanning to identify systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144 and before gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the report.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. It is more relevant to the Command and Control phase, which occurs after initial access.
- **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities on target systems. The report mentions that Emissary Panda identified systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the report.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Active Scanning (T1595)**: The report states that Emissary Panda identified systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144. This is a clear indication of active scanning.
2. **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)**: After identifying the vulnerable systems, Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers to gain initial access.
3. **Sequence**: The sequence of events is:
   - Active Scanning (T1595) to identify vulnerable systems.
   - Exploiting the identified vulnerability (T1190) to gain initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning
