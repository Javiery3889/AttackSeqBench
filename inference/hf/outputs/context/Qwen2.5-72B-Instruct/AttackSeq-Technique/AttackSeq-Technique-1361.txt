### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **CVE-2015-5119** exploit code was used.
- The exploit was hosted at **www[.]cbppnews[.]com/movie.swf**.
- Upon successful exploitation, a file was saved at **%Temp%/Rdws.exe**.
- **Rdws.exe** was executed and wrote another file at **%TEMP%/adobe.dat**.
- **adobe.dat** was used as a first stage downloader to retrieve a second stage **PlugX** file.
- The **PlugX** file connected to several C2 domains, including **cdn[.]sanecat[.]com**.

**Others:**
- Sakula malware variant has been linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns.
- Sakula and PlugX have been observed using the same C2 infrastructure.
- The malware is likely used by well-resourced operators.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute "%Temp%/Rdws.exe", which subsequently retrieved a second-stage PlugX file, which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated its communication with C2 domains such as inocnation[.]com?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1001.002-Steganography
- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
- D: T1005-Data from Local System

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access** (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)
2. **Execution** (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter)
3. **Persistence** (T1105-Remote File Copy)
4. **Command and Control** (T1071-Application Layer Protocol)

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - Steganography involves hiding data within other files or protocols. The report does not mention any use of steganography.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers. The report mentions that the PlugX file connected to C2 domains, which aligns with this technique.
- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware. While the initial access was through a drive-by compromise, the question is about the communication with C2 domains, not the initial access.
- **D: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system. The report does not mention data collection from the local system in the context of C2 communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that the PlugX file connected to several C2 domains, including **cdn[.]sanecat[.]com**.
- The communication with C2 domains is a key aspect of the Command and Control (C2) phase of the attack.
- The most appropriate ATT&CK technique for this phase, given the context, is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
