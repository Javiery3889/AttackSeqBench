### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- GreyEnergy targets energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland.
- Activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password and credential stealing.
- Targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

**Resource Development:**
- Modular malware framework.
- Mini backdoor deployed before admin rights are obtained.
- C&C servers are active Tor relays for operational security.

**Persistence:**
- Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Stealth techniques: selected modules pushed to selected targets, partial encryption, fileless execution.

**Credential Access:**
- Use of common external tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks to redirect requests to an external C&C server.

**Command and Control:**
- Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

**Others:**
- Linked to BlackEnergy and TeleBots.
- Modern toolkit with a focus on stealth.
- Some samples signed with a stolen certificate from Advantech.
- Deployed an early version of the TeleBots' NotPetya worm.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
After GreyEnergy's operators used spearphishing and the compromise of servers as infection vectors, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they attempted lateral movement to other workstations within the targeted organization's network?

**Answer Choices:**
A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
C: T1217-Browser Information Discovery
D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Sequence of TTPs from the CTI Report:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spearphishing and server compromise.
2. **Persistence:**
   - Securely wipe malware components.
3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Stealth techniques, partial encryption, fileless execution.
4. **Credential Access:**
   - Use of Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
5. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Deploy internal C&C proxies.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. The report does not mention exploiting public-facing applications, so this is unlikely.
- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. The report mentions stealth techniques and wiping malware components, which aligns with this technique.
- **C: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering information from the browser. The report does not mention browser information discovery, so this is unlikely.
- **D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising the supply chain. The report does not mention supply chain compromise, so this is unlikely.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that GreyEnergy uses stealth techniques and wipes malware components to evade detection.
- The technique T1564 (Hide Artifacts) aligns with these actions, as it involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection.
- Before attempting lateral movement, it is logical for the attackers to ensure their presence is hidden to avoid detection and maintain access.

**Final Answer:**
B: T1564-Hide Artifacts
