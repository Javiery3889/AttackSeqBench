### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A watering hole attack targeting iOS users in Hong Kong.
- Malicious links on forums led to legitimate news sites with hidden iframes.
- Exploited vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to download lightSpy malware.

**Execution:**
- lightSpy installs a modular backdoor for remote command execution and file manipulation.
- Capabilities include data exfiltration and full control of the device.

**Collection:**
- Modules collect and exfiltrate various data, including hardware info, contacts, text messages, call history, WiFi info, browser history, and user location.
- Specific modules target data from apps like WeChat, QQ, and Telegram.

**Command and Control:**
- Hardcoded C&C server locations.
- Main control module (light) loads and updates other modules for data extraction and exfiltration.

**Others:**
- Similar campaign targeting Android devices (dmsSpy) in 2019.
- Malicious APKs distributed via Telegram channels.
- Shared domain name (hkrevolution[.]club) suggests the same threat actors.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Once lightSpy established execution to install a modular backdoor for remote command capabilities, which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled the malware to maintain evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- B: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing
- C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
- D: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
- This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
- Not directly related to evasion or exploiting a Safari bug.

**T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing:**
- This technique involves adversaries manipulating DHCP responses to control network configurations.
- Not relevant to exploiting a Safari bug or using a signed Apple developer certificate.

**T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:**
- This technique involves adversaries subverting trust controls to gain access to systems or data.
- Relevant to using a signed Apple developer certificate to evade detection and maintain persistence.

**T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:**
- This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible.
- Not relevant to exploiting a Safari bug or using a signed Apple developer certificate.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks about maintaining evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.
- Exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate are techniques to subvert trust controls.
- T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is the most relevant technique as it involves subverting trust mechanisms, which aligns with using a signed certificate to evade detection.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
