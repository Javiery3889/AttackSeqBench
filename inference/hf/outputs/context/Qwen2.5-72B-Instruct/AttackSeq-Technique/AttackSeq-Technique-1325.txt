### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Credential Access**: The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
- **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
- **Command and Control**: Communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for data exfiltration and updates.
- **Exfiltration**: Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next after CosmicDuke conducts discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including non-English filenames.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery**: The report states that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
- **Next Step**: After discovering and identifying the files, the next logical step would be to gather more information from the victim's system. The options provided are:
  - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is used for persistence, which is already mentioned in the report.
  - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which is not mentioned in the report.
  - **C: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This technique involves persistence at the kernel level, which is not mentioned in the report.
  - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen, which is a method to gather more information from the victim's system.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The discovery phase involves searching for files, which is a form of information gathering.
  - After discovering the files, the next logical step would be to gather more detailed information from the victim's system.
  - Screen capture (T1113) is a method to gather visual information, which can provide additional context and details about the victim's activities and environment.
  - The other options (A, B, C) are either related to persistence or not mentioned in the report, making them less likely to be the next step after discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
