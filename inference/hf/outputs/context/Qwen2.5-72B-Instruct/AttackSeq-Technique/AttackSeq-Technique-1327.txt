### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
     - Malicious Flash objects in PDF files exploit CVE-2011-0611.
     - Executable files are disguised as images or documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
     - Loader compilation dates and updates are noted.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service'.
     - Installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
     - Copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Steals credentials from various software and Windows.
     - Exports certificates and private keys.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
     - Targets non-English filenames, particularly those related to encryption ciphers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates via HTTP GET requests.
     - Uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report details that CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.
   - **Data from Removable Media (T1025):**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's context of gathering information from removable drives.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1127.002-ClickOnce:**
     - This technique involves using ClickOnce deployment to execute malicious code, which is not relevant to gathering data from removable media.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:**
     - This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials, which is not relevant to gathering data from removable media.
   - **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not relevant to gathering data from removable media.
   - **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's context.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media
