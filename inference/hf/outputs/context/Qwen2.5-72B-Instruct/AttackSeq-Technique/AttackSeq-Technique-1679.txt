### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update.
- **Initial Access**: The initial compromise involved SocGholish delivered via compromised websites, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript.
- **Execution**: Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
- **Defense Evasion**: PsExec was used to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
- **Credential Access**: Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and clearing log files.
- **Discovery**: The attackers used commands like whoami, net user, net group, and Get-NetComputer to profile the network.
- **Command and Control**: The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
- **Impact**: The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, encrypting computers and servers.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the attackers executed processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which is the final stage of the attack (Impact). It does not describe the propagation across the network.
- **T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to manipulate victims, which is not relevant to executing processes on remote computers.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute processes on remote computers, which aligns with the propagation across the network.
- **T1583.004-Server**: This technique involves using a server to support the attack, but it does not specifically describe the execution of processes on remote computers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers used Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and clearing log files.
- After gaining credentials and clearing logs, the next logical step is to propagate across the network.
- The report mentions that the attackers used wmic.exe to execute commands on remote computers, which is a form of remote service execution.
- The technique T1021-Remote Services fits this description, as it involves using remote services to execute processes on remote computers.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
