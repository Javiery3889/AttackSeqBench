### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files in specified directories.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after FamousSparrow injected the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes but before they used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves reading data from the local system, which is part of the Collection phase. However, it is not specifically mentioned as occurring between process injection and credential dumping.
   - **T1612-Build Image on Host:** This technique involves building an image on the host, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the report.
   - **T1135-Network Share Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network shares, which is part of the Discovery phase. However, it is not specifically mentioned as occurring between process injection and credential dumping.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is mentioned in the report. The report states that FamousSparrow injected the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes. This is a key step that occurs before using Mimikatz to dump credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the report is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution:** Running commands to download and install SparrowDoor.
     3. **Persistence:** Creating registry entries and installing services.
     4. **Process Injection:** Injecting the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes.
     5. **Credential Access:** Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - The question specifically asks about the technique that occurred after process injection but before credential dumping.
   - The most plausible technique that fits this sequence is **T1055-Process Injection** because it is the step that directly precedes the use of Mimikatz for credential dumping.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection
