### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Credential stuffing or password spraying using previously obtained credentials.
     - Accessing remote services like webmail, VPN, Citrix.
   - **Execution:**
     - Installing Cobalt Strike using PowerShell.
     - Using scheduled tasks to execute batch files.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Loading Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.
     - Searching for VPN and firewall configs for backup access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Password spraying against domain admin accounts.
     - Lateral movement to systems with domain admin logged in.
     - Using tools like NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Clearing Windows event logs.
     - File deletion and timestomping.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Brute force and credential stuffing.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Using tools like PsLogList to export Security Event logs.
     - Identifying privileged users and dumping their credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement methods (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM).
     - Moving to domain controllers.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collecting data from various sources (SharePoint, file shares, email).
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Using C2 channel for small data.
     - Using custom-built malware to exfiltrate large data to cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary established C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike and then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:**
     - This technique involves maintaining a communication channel with the C2 server. However, the question specifies that the C2 communication is already established.
   - **T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials:**
     - This technique involves using additional cloud credentials to maintain access. The question does not mention the adversary obtaining additional cloud credentials.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While the adversary uses PowerShell and batch files, this technique is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. The question mentions that the C2 communication is established through HTTPS encapsulation, which is a form of encrypted communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI report and the question is that the adversary established C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation and then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services. The technique that best fits this sequence is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
