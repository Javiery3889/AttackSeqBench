### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Key Details:**
- **Command and Control (C2):** Binaries receive instructions from C2 servers.
- **DDoS Tool:** KernelBot is used to execute DDoS attacks.
- **Targeting Instructions:** C2 servers provide targeting instructions for the KernelBot network.
- **Encoding:** Configuration files are encoded using single-byte XOR keys.
- **Targets:** Primarily Next Media or Apple daily websites, and the HKGolden forum.

**Attack Sequence in MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:**
1. **Command and Control (C2):** Binaries receive instructions from C2 servers.
2. **Data Encoding:** Configuration files are encoded using single-byte XOR keys.
3. **Execution:** KernelBot implants receive and execute the targeting instructions.
4. **Impact:** DDoS attacks are launched against the specified targets.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
After receiving instructions from C2 servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong?

**Answer Choices:**
A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries
B: T1498-Network Denial of Service
C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood
D: T1590.001-Domain Properties

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Matching the Attack Sequence:**
- **C2 (Command and Control):** The binaries receive instructions from C2 servers.
- **Data Encoding:** Configuration files are encoded using single-byte XOR keys.
- **Execution:** KernelBot implants receive and execute the targeting instructions.
- **Impact:** DDoS attacks are launched against the specified targets.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries:** This technique involves creating autostart entries to ensure persistence. It does not align with the DDoS attack described.
- **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting network availability, which aligns with the DDoS attacks described in the report.
- **C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:** This technique involves exhausting system resources, which is a specific type of DDoS attack. While it is related, the report does not specify this level of detail.
- **D: T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves manipulating domain properties, which is not relevant to the DDoS attack described.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that the KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions from C2 servers and launch DDoS attacks against the specified targets.
- The primary impact of these attacks is to disrupt the availability of the targeted websites, which is a classic Network Denial of Service (NDoS) attack.
- The other answer choices do not align with the described attack sequence and impact.

**Final Answer:**
B: T1498-Network Denial of Service
