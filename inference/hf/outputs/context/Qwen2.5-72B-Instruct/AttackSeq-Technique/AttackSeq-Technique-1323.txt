### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
- **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
- **Credential Access**: The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches removable drives for files.
- **Command and Control**: Communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, FTP, and WebDav.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that follows after CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and configuring a Windows service. Specifically, it mentions that the malware searches hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard**: This technique involves using cloud service dashboards to manage and control cloud resources. It does not fit the context of searching for files on hard drives and network drives.
- **T1055.015-ListPlanting**: This technique involves listing processes to identify potential targets for process injection. It does not fit the context of file searching.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries performing discovery of files and directories on a system. This fits the context of searching for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code. This is already mentioned in the persistence phase and does not fit the context of file searching.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report mentions that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches removable drives for files.
- The question specifically asks about the technique that follows after achieving persistence and involves searching for specific file patterns.
- The most relevant technique that fits this description is **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
