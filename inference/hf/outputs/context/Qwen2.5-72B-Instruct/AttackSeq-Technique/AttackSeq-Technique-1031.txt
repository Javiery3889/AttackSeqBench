### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Key Details:**
- **Defense Evasion:**
  - The Kingslayer backdoor used a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to beacon to www.oraclesoft[.]net only between 1500 to 0000 UTC and on specific days of the week.
  - The backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised between 09 April 2015 to 25 April 2015.
  - The backdoor's unusual beaconing pattern was designed to evade detection.

- **Command and Control:**
  - RSA Research sinkholed the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net to inform the Kingslayer investigation.
  - The Kingslayer backdoor and the secondary malware, dubbed 'K2', used this domain for command and control (C2).
  - K2 beaconed every ten minutes without a defined sleep period.

- **Others:**
  - The Kingslayer campaign was linked to the Codoso and Shell_Crew threat groups.
  - The campaign targeted sysadmins of large enterprises.
  - The backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code.
  - The report includes a Yara signature for detecting Kingslayer artifacts and advises on investigating potential compromises.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before Kingslayer employed a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion using a stolen code signing private key, which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated its deployment into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
- B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
- C: T1021.005-VNC
- D: T1219-Remote Access Software

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Compromise of Alpha's software packaging system (09 April 2015 to 25 April 2015):**
   - This suggests a supply chain compromise where the attackers gained access to the software packaging system and stole a code signing private key.
2. **Deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor:**
   - The backdoor was signed with the stolen code signing private key, making it appear legitimate.
3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The backdoor used a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to evade detection.
4. **Command and Control:**
   - The backdoor and secondary malware used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:**
  - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not mentioned in the report. The report focuses on software compromise.
- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:**
  - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain, which aligns with the report's mention of the compromised software packaging system and the stolen code signing private key.
- **C: T1021.005-VNC:**
  - This technique involves using VNC for remote access, which is not mentioned in the report.
- **D: T1219-Remote Access Software:**
  - This technique involves using remote access software, which is not the primary method described for deploying the backdoor.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that the Kingslayer backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised.
- This indicates a supply chain compromise where the attackers gained access to the software packaging system and used it to sign their malware, making it appear legitimate.
- The use of a stolen code signing private key is a common technique in supply chain attacks to bypass security measures and gain trust within the target environment.

**Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
