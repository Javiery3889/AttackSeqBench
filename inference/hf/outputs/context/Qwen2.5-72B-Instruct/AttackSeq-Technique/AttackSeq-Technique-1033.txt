### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with a software supply-chain attack where a Trojan was inserted into legitimate software 'Alpha'.
- The software was subverted at its distribution point with malicious, signed code in April 2015.
- Users who installed or updated the software within the subversion window received the malicious version, which attempted to load secondary payloads.

**Command and Control:**
- The domain www.oraclesoft[.]net was used for command and control (C2).
- The Kingslayer backdoor and the secondary malware, 'K2', used this domain.
- K2 beaconed every ten minutes without a defined sleep period.

**Others:**
- The Kingslayer campaign was linked to the Codoso and Shell_Crew threat groups.
- The campaign targeted sysadmins of large enterprises.
- The Kingslayer backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Kingslayer backdoor was loaded via the malicious 'Alpha' software subversion, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before it evaded detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1219-Remote Access Software
- B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication
- C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code
- D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access (T1195):** The Trojan was inserted into the legitimate software 'Alpha'.
2. **Execution (T1204):** Users who installed or updated the software received the malicious version, which attempted to load secondary payloads.
3. **Command and Control (T1071):** The backdoor and secondary malware used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2.
4. **Defense Evasion (T1027.014):** The backdoor used a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to evade detection.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - This technique involves the use of remote access tools (RATs) to maintain access to a system. While the backdoor and secondary malware are forms of remote access, this does not specifically address the evasion technique mentioned in the question.
- **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
  - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to maintain access. It is not directly related to the evasion technique mentioned in the question.
- **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
  - This technique involves using code that changes its appearance but not its underlying functionality to evade detection. This aligns with the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm, which is a form of evasion.
- **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as code signing, to gain access. While the initial subversion of the software distribution point is related, it does not directly address the evasion technique mentioned in the question.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks about the technique that occurred before the backdoor evaded detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
- The diurnal beacon sleep algorithm is a form of evasion, which is best described by T1027.014-Polymorphic Code.
- The other techniques (T1219, T1556.001, and T1553) do not directly address the evasion technique mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code
