### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Higaisa APT group used spear-phishing to distribute malicious LNK files within RAR archives.
- The LNK files were disguised as a Curriculum Vitae, IELTS exam results, or targeted product teams using zeplin.io.

**Execution:**
- Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack:
  - Copies the LNK content to a temporary directory.
  - Uses 'certutil.exe' renamed to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection.
  - Decodes a base64 blob.
  - Decompresses content along with a decoy PDF document.
  - Executes a JavaScript file.
  - The JavaScript file performs additional actions:
    - Creates and executes 'd3reEW.exe'.
    - Copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
    - Sends a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

**Persistence:**
- The JavaScript file:
  - Creates 'd3reEW.exe' in a public downloads directory.
  - Executes 'svchast.exe'.
  - Copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as 'officeupdate.exe'.
  - Adds 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack uses a list of commands executed by the LNK shortcut, similar to those reported in the Higasia Covid-19 campaign.
- 'certutil.exe' is renamed to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection.

**Discovery:**
- The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' with the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information.

**Others:**
- The Higaisa APT group's activities date back to at least 2016.
- They use Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware.
- Targets include government officials, human rights organizations, and other entities related to North Korea.
- Malwarebytes Labs identified the attack on May 29th and stopped the LNK file execution using the Nebula business version of their software.
- The attack was first disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the JavaScript file created 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information using the command 'cmd /c ipconfig', which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
- C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
- D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The JavaScript file sends a POST request to a hardcoded URL.
- The command 'cmd /c ipconfig' is used to discover IP address information.

**Evaluating the Answer Choices:**

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server.
  - The report mentions a POST request to a hardcoded URL, which is a common method for C&C communication over HTTPS.

- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
  - While the report mentions adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks, this is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication with the C&C server.

- **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic.
  - The report does not mention the use of an internal proxy.

- **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connection details.
  - The report mentions using 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information, but this is more about discovery rather than enabling HTTPS communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The JavaScript file sends a POST request to a hardcoded URL, which is a clear indication of C&C communication.
- The use of HTTPS is a common method for secure C&C communication.
- The command 'cmd /c ipconfig' is used to discover IP address information, which is a prerequisite for establishing a network connection but not the method for enabling HTTPS communication.

**Final Answer:**
- A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
