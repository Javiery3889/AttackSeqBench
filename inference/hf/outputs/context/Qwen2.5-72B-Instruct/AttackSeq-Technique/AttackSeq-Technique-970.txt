### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
- Archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
- Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.

**Execution:**
- Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.

**Persistence:**
- Established through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
- Injected into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Limited daily C&C server activity.
- Fileless loading techniques.
- Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.

**Collection:**
- Capabilities include file/directory manipulation, screenshots, file search, process enumeration, file metadata collection, TCP session closure, OS information gathering, and location verification.

**Command and Control:**
- Used HTTP and TCP protocols.
- Sent data to C&C domain with XORed password.
- Listened for additional commands.

**Others:**
- Targeted national government entities in the Asia Pacific region.
- Used infected ministries as C&C servers.
- Infrastructure used GoDaddy for domain registration and Alibaba for hosting.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Aria-body backdoor collected detailed host and network information from the victim's machine, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software as part of the discovery phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
- B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups
- C: T1518-Software Discovery
- D: T1113-Screen Capture

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to gather OS information, file metadata, and other detailed host and network information.
- The backdoor is involved in the discovery phase, which includes gathering information about the victim's machine.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. It is not directly related to the discovery of installed software.
- **B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups:** This technique involves enumerating cloud groups and roles. It is not relevant to the discovery of installed software on a local machine.
- **C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about installed software, which aligns with the backdoor's capabilities to collect detailed host and network information.
- **D: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a collection capability but not directly related to the discovery of installed software.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The Aria-body backdoor is capable of collecting detailed host and network information, which includes OS information and file metadata.
- The discovery phase involves gathering information about the victim's machine, including installed software.
- Among the given choices, T1518-Software Discovery is the most relevant technique that aligns with the backdoor's capabilities and the discovery phase.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1518-Software Discovery
