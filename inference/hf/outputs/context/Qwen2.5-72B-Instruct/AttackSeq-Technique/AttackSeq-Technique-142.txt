### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The report describes the exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files. These files are used to gain initial access to the target systems.
- **Collection**: The report mentions the collection of malicious HWP file samples, indicating targeted attacks on specific professions or groups. The files often impersonate government inquiries or job-related documents.
- **Others**: The report provides additional context about the detection and blocking of HWP malware by AhnLab's V3 product and the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to simplify malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection after the initial exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's email client or server. It is not related to simplifying code for evasion.
- **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves intercepting the execution of a program by placing a malicious executable in a directory that is listed in the system's PATH environment variable. It is not directly related to simplifying code for evasion.
- **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions on service registry keys to modify service configurations. It is not directly related to simplifying code for evasion.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to evade detection. This could include simplifying code to make it less detectable by security products.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report mentions the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms and emphasizes the importance of continuous analysis and assessment. This suggests that the attackers are likely to modify their code to evade detection.
- Among the given options, **T1070-Indicator Removal** is the most relevant technique for simplifying malicious EPS file code to better evade detection. This technique involves removing or altering indicators that could be used to identify the malware, which aligns with the report's emphasis on continuous changes to the malicious files.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
