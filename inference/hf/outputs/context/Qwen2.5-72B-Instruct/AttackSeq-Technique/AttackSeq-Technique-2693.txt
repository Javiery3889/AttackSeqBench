### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.

**Initial Access:**
- Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 in WinRAR via spear-phishing.

**Execution:**
- Deployed a wide range of tools, including custom and commodity malware.

**Persistence:**
- Created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.

**Credential Access:**
- Deployed DarkComet, which included a credential dumping tool.

**Command and Control:**
- Used POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools to maintain control.

**Exfiltration:**
- Used custom .NET FTP and AutoIt FTP exfiltration tools to exfiltrate data.

**Others:**
- Symantec provided protection and threat intelligence.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Elfin used PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging on infected systems for defense evasion and before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials from compromised systems.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the Question:**
- **After:** Bypassing logging (Defense Evasion)
- **Before:** Deploying DarkComet for credential dumping (Credential Access)

**Relevant ATT&CK Techniques:**
- **T1595-Active Scanning:** This is a reconnaissance technique, which occurs before initial access.
- **T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging:** This is a technique for process injection, which is more related to execution and persistence.
- **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves actions to disable or avoid security tools, which aligns with bypassing logging.
- **T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions in services, which is more related to persistence.

**Evaluation:**
- **T1595-Active Scanning:** This is a reconnaissance technique and does not fit the sequence of events described.
- **T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging:** This is more related to execution and persistence, not defense evasion.
- **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique fits the description of bypassing logging to evade defenses.
- **T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This is more related to persistence and does not fit the sequence of events described.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The sequence of events in the CTI report and the question indicates that Elfin first bypassed logging (defense evasion) and then deployed DarkComet to extract credentials.
- The technique that aligns with bypassing logging is **T1562-Impair Defenses**.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1562-Impair Defenses
