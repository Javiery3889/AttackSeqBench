### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection).
- Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Deploying custom malware (IPsec Helper backdoor).
- Exfiltrating data or deploying additional malware.
- Registering the backdoor as a service for persistence.
- Executing commands, uploading files, and updating configuration based on C2 commands.

**Persistence:**
- Deploying webshells.
- Registering the IPsec Helper backdoor as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Using webshells with variations of ASPXSpy.
- Obfuscating webshells with custom base64 encoding.
- Backdoor functionality to update and delete traces.

**Command and Control:**
- Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Configuration file with encrypted server addresses.
- Awaiting commands for updates, recon, file downloads, and self-deletion.

**Impact:**
- Deploying wipers (Apostle, DEADWOOD).
- Overwriting files with random data.
- Ensuring proper execution and preventing user access.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
After Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement, which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network?

**Answer Choices:**
A: T1552.008-Chat Messages
B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
- They exploited public-facing applications and used RDP for lateral movement.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**

- **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
  - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not relevant to remote exploitation or lateral movement.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication, which is relevant to C2 communication but not directly to remote exploitation.

- **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. This aligns with the use of RDP for lateral movement and the exploitation of remote services.

- **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
  - This technique involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which is a valid method but not specifically mentioned in the report as the primary method used by Agrius.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
- RDP is a remote service, and exploiting it for lateral movement falls under the category of T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
- The other answer choices do not directly align with the specific method of using RDP for lateral movement as described in the report.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
