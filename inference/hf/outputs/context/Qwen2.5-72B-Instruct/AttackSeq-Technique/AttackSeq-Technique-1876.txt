### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
- **Execution**: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
- **Persistence**: FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and email communications for command and control.
- **Privilege Escalation**: FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials. They also use certutil for obfuscation.
- **Defense Evasion**: FIN13 uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil.
- **Credential Access**: FIN13 uses process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
- **Discovery**: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware.
- **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
- **Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Command and Control**: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
- **Exfiltration**: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1596.004-CDNs**: This technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host and deliver malicious content. This is not mentioned in the CTI report and does not align with the initial access method described.
- **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves modifying the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) registry key to inject code into a process. This is not mentioned in the CTI report and does not align with the initial access method described.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's environment. This could be relevant, but it typically occurs after initial access has been established.
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is a common pre-attack activity. The CTI report mentions that FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware. This aligns well with the discovery phase, which often occurs before or during the initial access phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
- **Pre-Initial Access**: Before exploiting external servers, FIN13 likely gathers information about the victim's network to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique aligns with the pre-attack activities described in the CTI report, where FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations.

**Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
