### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attackers compromised the Afghan Government's CDN server, cdn.afghanistan.af, and modified the Javascript file `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` to load additional malicious code from the IP address 176.58.101.24.
- **Others**: The attackers used IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation, suggesting a targeted campaign. Communication with the malicious IP address 176.58.101.24 resulted in HTTP 403 (Forbidden) responses, indicating selective exploitation.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After gaining initial access by modifying the Javascript file `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` on the Afghan Government's CDN server to load additional malicious code, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers evaded detection using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack
  - B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning
  - C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
  - D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The report clearly states that the attackers gained initial access by modifying the Javascript file on the CDN server to load additional malicious code. This aligns with the **Drive-by Compromise** technique (T1189).
- **Evading Detection**: The question mentions that the attackers used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection. This aligns with the **Obfuscated Files or Information** technique (T1027).

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers modified the Javascript file on the CDN server to load additional malicious code. This is a clear example of a **Drive-by Compromise** (T1189).
2. **Evading Detection**: After gaining initial access, the attackers used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to obfuscate the malicious code, making it harder to detect. This is an example of **Obfuscated Files or Information** (T1027).

Given the sequence of events:
- **Initial Access**: T1189 (Drive-by Compromise)
- **Evading Detection**: T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information)

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **T1189 (Drive-by Compromise)** followed by **T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information)**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
