### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK).
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware (SIXPACK, SWEARJAR), and email communications (MAILSLOT).
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 leveraged custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests within the victim's environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which is not relevant to the context of establishing a local HTTP server.
   - **T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves placing a malicious component on a server to maintain persistence or control. This is relevant because FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold and maintain control.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While FIN13 uses scripts and commands, this is not the immediate next step after establishing a local HTTP server.
   - **T1213.005-Messaging Applications:** This technique involves using messaging applications for command and control. While FIN13 uses email communications, this is not the immediate next step after establishing a local HTTP server.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after establishing a local HTTP server using custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 would use this server to maintain persistence and control over the victim's environment. This aligns with the T1505-Server Software Component technique, which involves placing a malicious component on a server to maintain persistence or control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1505-Server Software Component
