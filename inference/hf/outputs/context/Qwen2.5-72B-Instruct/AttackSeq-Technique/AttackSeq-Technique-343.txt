### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers acquired and parked domains for future use (T1583.001).
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute code.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers maintained their foothold carefully.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers had high-level system access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like indicator removal (T1070), masquerading (T1036), subverting trust controls (T1553), and virtualization/sandbox evasion (T1497).
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used process discovery (T1057) and query registry (T1012).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers moved through the network.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution as a Command and Control (C2) technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves concealing the infrastructure used for C2, but it does not directly facilitate communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which is a common method for maintaining communication.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique is used for initial access, not for maintaining communication.
   - **T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves masquerading by using invalid code signatures, which is more about evading detection rather than maintaining communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers needed a way to communicate with the compromised systems after gaining initial access.
   - The initial access was achieved through a supply chain compromise (T1195.002), but this does not directly facilitate ongoing communication.
   - The attackers used various techniques to maintain their presence and avoid detection, including using standard application layer protocols (T1071) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - The use of standard application layer protocols (T1071) is a common and effective method for maintaining communication with compromised systems, especially in a sophisticated attack like the SolarWinds compromise.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
