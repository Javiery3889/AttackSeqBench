### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: TG-3279 performs reconnaissance via open source research and network scanning.
- **Resource Development**: Reuses network infrastructure, shares IP addresses, and uses unique domain registration information.
- **Initial Access**: Uses port scanning tool 's' and RDP brute force tool 'rdp_crk'.
- **Persistence**: Leverages optionally loaded DLLs for the Conpee plugin framework without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Installs tools by compromising admin credentials.
- **Defense Evasion**: C2 communication over port 443 but not HTTPS, using the PATX framework, with IP calculations and domain name parking.
- **Credential Access**: Strives to access network and system admin accounts.
- **Lateral Movement**: Uses key hosts as beachheads with Conpee or Etso tools, adds scheduled system tasks to other key resources using compromised credentials from pwdump6.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After TG-3279 relied on a few key hosts as beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools and added scheduled system tasks to key resources using compromised credentials from pwdump6, which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols
  - B: T1595-Active Scanning
  - C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
  - D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Relevant Information from the Report**:
  - C2 communication over port 443 but not HTTPS.
  - Uses the PATX framework, with IP calculations and domain name parking to complicate investigations.

- **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols for C2 communication. The report does not mention the use of mail protocols.
  - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for open ports and services. While TG-3279 uses port scanning, this is not the technique used for C2 communication.
  - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. The report mentions that C2 communication occurs over port 443, which is a standard port, but the traffic is not HTTPS. This aligns with the use of a non-standard protocol over a standard port.
  - **D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique involves acquiring infrastructure to support operations. While TG-3279 reuses network infrastructure, this is not the technique used for C2 communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The report clearly states that C2 communication occurs over port 443 but is not HTTPS traffic.
  - This aligns with the use of a non-standard protocol over a standard port, which is described by T1571-Non-Standard Port.
  - The other answer choices do not fit the specific context of C2 communication over port 443 with non-HTTPS traffic.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
