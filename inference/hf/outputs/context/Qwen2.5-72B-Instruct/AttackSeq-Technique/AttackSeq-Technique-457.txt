### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The rootkit named CEIDPageLock is distributed by the RIG Exploit kit.
- It tampers with the homepage of the victim's browser, redirecting it to a site pretending to be 2345.com.

**Persistence:**
- The dropper extracts the driver from the file and saves it in the \Windows\Temp directory as houzi.sys.
- The driver is registered and started, and the dropper sends the MAC address and user-id to the domain www[.]tj999[.]top.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver launched during startup.
- It employs tricks to evade and hide from endpoint security products.
- The driver connects with one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the homepage configuration, which is encrypted.

**Collection:**
- CEIDPageLock operators gather browsing data on victims, monitoring the sites users visit and the duration of their visits.

**Others:**
- CEIDPageLock targets Chinese victims specifically.
- The malware adds a method of creating a registry key in safemon-360safe's security product as part of the rootkit installation routine.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "After the CEIDPageLock rootkit gathers browsing data on victims to monitor websites visited and time spent, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for the rootkit to establish communication with its hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**

A: **T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
- This technique involves using customer relationship management (CRM) software to gain access to or manipulate data. It does not fit the context of the rootkit establishing communication with C&C domains.

B: **T1205-Traffic Signaling**
- This technique involves using legitimate network protocols to blend in with normal traffic. While it could be used to evade detection, it does not specifically describe the method of communication with C&C domains.

C: **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with C&C servers. This fits the context of the rootkit downloading the homepage configuration from the C&C server.

D: **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
- This technique involves compromising a victim's system through a malicious website. While it is relevant to the initial access, it does not describe the communication with C&C domains after the rootkit is installed.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The rootkit gathers browsing data and then needs to communicate with C&C domains to download the homepage configuration.
- The communication with C&C domains is described as involving encrypted data.
- The most likely technique for this communication is using standard application layer protocols, which is described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
