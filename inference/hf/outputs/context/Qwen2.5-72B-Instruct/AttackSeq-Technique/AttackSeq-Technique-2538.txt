### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- BLACKGEAR uses blogs and microblogging services to conceal the location of its C&C servers.
- This technique allows for quick changes to C&C servers by updating posts.

**Initial Access:**
- The campaign targets Japanese users with fake documents in Japanese to increase the chances of successful infiltration.

**Persistence:**
- Malware tools (binders, downloaders, backdoors) ensure persistence by moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.

**Others:**
- The campaign uses a variety of adaptable and replaceable tools.
- Shared strings and decryption keys indicate a coordinated set of malware families.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after ensuring persistence, specifically when backdoors retrieved encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Persistence:**
- The report states that the malware ensures persistence by moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.

**Retrieving C&C Configuration:**
- The report mentions that the C&C server locations are concealed in blogs and microblogs.
- The backdoors retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from these sources.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. While it could be related to reconnaissance, it doesn't specifically address retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information.
- **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with C&C servers. This is a strong candidate as it directly relates to retrieving information from web-based sources.
- **C: T1588.005-Exploits**: This technique involves using exploits to gain access or execute code. It is not relevant to retrieving C&C configuration information.
- **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data. While it could be used to encrypt the C&C configuration, it doesn't directly address the retrieval process.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Persistence** is established by moving malware to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.
- **Retrieving C&C Configuration** involves accessing encrypted information from blogs and microblogs.
- **T1102-Web Service** is the most relevant technique because it directly involves using web services to communicate with C&C servers, which aligns with the described method of retrieving C&C configuration information from blogs and microblogs.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
