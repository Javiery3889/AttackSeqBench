### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
- **Execution**: Execution of malicious code to gain control.
- **Persistence**: Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
- **Defense Evasion**: Bypassing defense mechanisms.
- **Credential Access**: Obtaining valid credentials for legitimate access.
- **Discovery**: Exploring the network to locate relevant systems and data.
- **Collection**: Gathering the relevant data.
- **Command and Control**: Establishing communication channels to control the compromised infrastructure.
- **Exfiltration**: Extracting the data.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversaries discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials to enable legitimate access within the target network, as they moved across the network to further their objectives.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple command and control channels. While this is important for maintaining control, it is not directly related to moving across the network.
- **T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**: This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies, which is more about altering the environment rather than moving across the network.
- **T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, but the report does not specifically mention cloud services.
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems, which aligns with the idea of moving across the network.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The report mentions that after discovering critical systems and gaining valid credentials, the adversaries moved across the network to further their objectives.
- The most relevant technique for moving across the network is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**. This technique involves using vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.
- The other techniques (T1104, T1484, T1021.007) do not directly address the movement across the network in the context provided.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
