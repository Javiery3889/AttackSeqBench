### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Use of `LoadLibraryA`, `CreateProcessA`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError` for code execution.
- Use of `LdrRegisterDllNotification` and `LdrUnregisterDllNotification` for DLL notifications.
- Use of `cmd.exe` with `/C` switch and `powershell` for command execution.

**Persistence:**
- Registry modifications using `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, and `DeleteKey`.
- Manipulation of `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` for persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Memory and process manipulation using `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, and `ZwClose`.
- Use of `RtlNtStatusToDosError` to convert NT status codes to Windows error codes.

**Discovery:**
- Gathering system information using `GetStringValue`, `GetDWORDValue`, and `CreateKey` functions.
- Thread context manipulation using `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread`.

**Others:**
- Use of encoding and obfuscation techniques.
- Manipulation of file paths and names.
- Use of `runas` and `copy` commands.
- Use of ActiveX objects and Internet Explorer settings.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols after the discovery techniques were used to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery Techniques:**
- Querying registry values using `GetStringValue`, `GetDWORDValue`, and `CreateKey`.
- Manipulating thread contexts using `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread`.

**Communication Techniques:**
- The question specifically asks about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using external proxies to route traffic, which is not directly related to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS.
- **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service:** This technique involves disrupting network availability, which is not related to establishing communication.
- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using common application layer protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS, to communicate with a remote system.
- **D: T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is not directly related to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The discovery techniques (querying registry values and manipulating thread contexts) are used to gather information about the system and its processes.
- After gathering this information, the next logical step for the adversaries would be to establish communication with a remote server to exfiltrate data or receive further commands.
- The use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communication is a common technique in cyber attacks, as these protocols are widely used and can often bypass network security measures.
- Among the given answer choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant and plausible technique for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
