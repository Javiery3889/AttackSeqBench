### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
- **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's to execute the payload.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Credential Access**: The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
- **Discovery**: It searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers to collect information.
- **Command and Control**: It communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitates the transfer of collected information to remote servers after CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which is not mentioned in the CTI report.
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is not the focus of the question.
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data, which is a plausible method for transferring collected information.
- **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which aligns with the CTI report's mention of using HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report states that CosmicDuke uses HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav servers to exfiltrate collected data.
- The technique **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** directly aligns with this method of exfiltration.
- The other techniques (T1025, T1590, and T1020) do not match the specific method described in the report.

**Final Answer: D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
