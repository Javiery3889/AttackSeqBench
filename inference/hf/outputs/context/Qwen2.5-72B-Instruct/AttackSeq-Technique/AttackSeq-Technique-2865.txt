### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows) to bypass User Account Control and install the Nidiran back door.
- **Execution**: Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools to infect internal hosts.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
- **Defense Evasion**: Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze and used encrypted communication with the C&C domain.
- **Credential Access**: Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
- **Discovery**: Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900, and 40 open.
- **Command and Control**: Suckfly's Nidiran back door communicated with the C&C domains.
- **Exfiltration**: Suckfly exfiltrated data using the Nidiran back door.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an existing session to a remote service. The report does not mention hijacking existing sessions.
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system. The report mentions scanning for open ports, which is a common precursor to exploiting remote services.
- **T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This technique involves requesting service ticket (TGS) requests for service accounts and then cracking the tickets offline. The report does not mention Kerberos or service tickets.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. The report does not mention public-facing applications.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The report mentions that Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with specific ports open (8080, 5900, and 40).
- **Step 2**: Scanning for open ports is often a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services.
- **Step 3**: The most likely next step after scanning for open ports would be to exploit those services to gain further access.
- **Step 4**: Among the given options, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most plausible technique that would follow the scanning of open ports.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
