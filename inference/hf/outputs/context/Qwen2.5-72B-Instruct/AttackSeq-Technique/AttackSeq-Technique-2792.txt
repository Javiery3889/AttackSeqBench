### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- It runs in the background immediately after installation.
- It can restart automatically on iOS 7 but not on iOS 8.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests after gathering information from the compromised iOS device.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**

A: **T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
- This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not directly related to communication with a C2 server using HTTP requests.

B: **T1102-Web Service**
- This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server. It is a common method for malware to send and receive data using HTTP POST and GET requests.

C: **T1518-Software Discovery**
- This technique involves discovering software on the system, which is part of the discovery phase but not related to communication with a C2 server.

D: **T1001.001-Junk Data**
- This technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the actual data being exfiltrated. It is not directly related to the communication method with a C2 server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report describes the malware collecting various types of information from the iOS device.
- After gathering this information, the malware needs to communicate with a C2 server to exfiltrate the data.
- The most likely method for this communication, given the use of POST and GET requests, is through a web service.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
