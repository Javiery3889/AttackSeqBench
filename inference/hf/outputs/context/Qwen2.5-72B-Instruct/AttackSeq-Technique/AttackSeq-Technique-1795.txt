### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks.
- **Resource Development**: Developed sophisticated tools, including backdoors and custom-built tools.
- **Initial Access**: Used spear-phishing emails with links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents.
- **Execution**: Operated a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads.
- **Persistence**: Established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion**: Exploited DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
- **Credential Access**: Harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
- **Lateral Movement**: Used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
- **Command and Control**: Used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group conducted lateral movement using harvested credentials and Windows built-in tools.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement**: The report states that the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for lateral movement.
- **Credential Access**: The report mentions that the OceanLotus Group harvested credentials using the Mimikatz tool before performing lateral movement.

To determine which technique occurred before lateral movement, we need to identify the steps that led to the acquisition of credentials.

- **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is not directly related to credential harvesting.
- **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves identifying valid accounts and their properties, which is a step that could precede credential harvesting.
- **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's identity, which is not directly related to credential harvesting.
- **T1110.001-Password Guessing**: This technique involves guessing passwords, which is not mentioned in the report and is less sophisticated than using Mimikatz.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence is:
1. **Account Discovery (T1087)**: The attackers would need to identify valid accounts and their properties before harvesting credentials.
2. **Credential Access (T1003)**: The attackers used Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
3. **Lateral Movement (T1021)**: The attackers used the harvested credentials and Windows built-in tools for lateral movement.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The OceanLotus Group needed to identify valid accounts and their properties before harvesting credentials.
- The report mentions the use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials, which is a step that follows account discovery.
- Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred before lateral movement is **Account Discovery (T1087)**.

**Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery**
