### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Credential stuffing or password spraying using previously obtained credentials.
     - Accessing remote services like webmail, VPN, Citrix.
   - **Execution:**
     - Installing Cobalt Strike using PowerShell.
     - Using scheduled tasks to execute batch files.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Loading Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.
     - Searching for VPN and firewall configs for backup access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Password spraying against domain admin accounts.
     - Moving laterally to systems with domain admin logged in.
     - Using tools like NtdsAudit and commands like `msadcs.exe` to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Clearing Windows event logs.
     - File deletion and timestomping.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Brute force and credential stuffing.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Using tools like PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
     - Identifying privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement methods (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM).
     - Moving to domain controllers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Using Cobalt Strike with C2 protocols encapsulated in DNS and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Using C2 channel for small data.
     - Using a custom-built tool to exfiltrate large data to cloud storage web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary used discovery commands (like PsLogList) to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:**
     - This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals, which is not mentioned in the report after the discovery phase.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the adversary's actions after discovery. The report mentions that the adversary uses the discovered information to identify data of interest, such as PII from memory or IP from network shares.
   - **T1218.014-MMC:**
     - This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for persistence or execution, which is not mentioned in the report.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is mentioned in the report but is used for small amounts of data, not large data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI report is that the adversary used discovery commands to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log, then collected data from the local system (T1005), and finally exfiltrated the data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
