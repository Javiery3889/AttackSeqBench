### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Command and Control (C2) Communications:**
  - INOCNATION Campaign: C2 domain inocnation[.]com
  - Ironman Campaign: C2 IP address 180.210.206.246
  - French Aerospace Campaign: C2 domain oa[.]ameteksen[.]com
- **Malware:**
  - Sakula malware is linked to zero-day exploits and high-profile incidents.
  - Sakula is associated with the use of PlugX.
  - Sakula and PlugX have used the same C2 infrastructure.
- **Campaigns:**
  - INOCNATION, Ironman, and French Aerospace Campaigns.
- **Others:**
  - Sakula is a limited-release tool used by multiple adversaries.
  - Likely used by well-resourced operators.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Context:**
  - Falcon Host detected a first stage downloader saving a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe".
  - The downloader later retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
  - The attack involved a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

- **Question:**
  - Which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access through the compromised website?

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices:**
  - **A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
    - This technique involves using a service (e.g., email, social media) to send spearphishing messages.
  - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
    - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with C2 servers.
  - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**
    - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server.
  - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
    - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors.

- **Evaluation:**
  - The report mentions a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".
  - A compromised website that delivers malicious content to visitors aligns with the **Drive-by Compromise** technique (T1189).
  - The other techniques (T1566.003, T1573, T1648) do not directly relate to the method of gaining access through a compromised website.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report indicates that the attack involved a compromised website.
  - The compromised website spoofed a legitimate organization, which is a common method used in drive-by compromises.
  - The first stage downloader and the retrieval of the second stage PlugX file suggest that the initial access was gained through a compromised website, which is consistent with the **Drive-by Compromise** technique (T1189).

- **Final Answer:**
  - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
