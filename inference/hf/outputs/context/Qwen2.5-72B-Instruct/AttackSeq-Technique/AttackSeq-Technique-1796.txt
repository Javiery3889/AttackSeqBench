### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks.
- **Resource Development**: Developed sophisticated tools, including backdoors and custom-built tools.
- **Initial Access**: Used spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
- **Execution**: Operated a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads.
- **Persistence**: Established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion**: Exploited DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
- **Credential Access**: Harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
- **Discovery**: Performed lateral movement using harvested credentials.
- **Command and Control**: Used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the OceanLotus Group's expansion within the network after harvesting credentials and before using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique involves using accessibility features to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to lateral movement or credential usage.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise. It is more related to defense evasion and not directly to lateral movement.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems. This aligns with the OceanLotus Group's use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials and then use them for lateral movement.
- **T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions. It is not mentioned in the CTI report and is not relevant to the described attack sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The OceanLotus Group harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
- They then used these credentials to perform lateral movement and infect more machines.
- The technique that best fits this sequence is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**, as it involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to other systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
