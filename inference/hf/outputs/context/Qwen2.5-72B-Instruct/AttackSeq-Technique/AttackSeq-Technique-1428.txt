### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Volexity reported a strategic web compromise (SWC) of the South Korean online newspaper Daily NK's website.
- Malicious code was present from late March 2021 until early June 2021.
- The attackers, identified as North Korean APT InkySquid, modified legitimate files on the website to redirect users to attacker-owned domains hosting malicious JavaScript.
- This activity targeted Internet Explorer users, leveraging exploits such as CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.

**Command and Control:**
- The BLUELIGHT malware, attributed to InkySquid, uses cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API for command and control operations.
- It performs oauth2 token authentication and sets up a directory structure in OneDrive for C2 protocol.
- The malware collects and uploads reconnaissance data, including system information and screenshots, and receives commands through the 'background' subdirectory.

**Others:**
- The BLUELIGHT malware, after successful exploitation, decrypts a final SVG variable containing a hex-encoded Cobalt Strike stager, which is then executed.
- The malware leverages Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, collecting system information and screenshots, and supports various commands including file search, data harvesting, and implant uninstallation.
- IoCs and signatures related to this activity are available on Volexity's GitHub page.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 during the strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware?

**Answer Choices:**
A: T1127 - Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution
B: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
C: T1564 - Hide Artifacts
D: T1003.003 - NTDS

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers used CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 to exploit Internet Explorer users.
- This is an example of T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application.

**Command and Control:**
- The BLUELIGHT malware uses Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
- This is an example of T1090 - Proxy and T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Sequence of Events:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) to gain initial access.
2. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - The malware decrypts a final SVG variable containing a hex-encoded Cobalt Strike stager, which is then executed.
3. **Command and Control:**
   - Use Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1127 - Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code. It is not mentioned in the report and does not fit the sequence.
- **B: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This is the initial access technique used to exploit Internet Explorer users.
- **C: T1564 - Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. The report mentions that the malware collects and uploads reconnaissance data, but it does not explicitly state that it hides artifacts.
- **D: T1003.003 - NTDS:** This technique involves stealing NTDS files to obtain password hashes. It is not mentioned in the report and does not fit the sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The initial access was achieved through T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application.
- After gaining access, the malware decrypts and executes a Cobalt Strike stager.
- Before setting up command and control, the malware likely performs some post-exploitation activities, such as collecting system information and screenshots.
- The most plausible post-exploitation activity that fits the sequence is T1564 - Hide Artifacts, as the malware needs to avoid detection while performing these activities.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1564 - Hide Artifacts
