### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The Tuyul botnet, written in Perl, executes commands on victim systems.
- Functionalities include promoting bots to higher privilege, demoting bots, updating malware, connecting to reverse shells, executing shell commands, running Perl scripts, and terminating the bot's connection.

**Persistence:**
- The malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
- It can detect and terminate processes from other malware infections.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines.
- It employs various PHP web shells, including Tiny File Manager and an unknown advanced web shell.

**Command and Control:**
- The botnet uses the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz as its C&C server.
- The C&C server and development servers are protected by Cloudflare.

**Others:**
- The botnet has possible Indonesian attribution.
- The botnet's peak size was 366 victim systems.
- Infected servers are primarily hosted on cloud services.
- The botnet's name, Tuyul, refers to a figure in Southeast Asian folklore.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl,' which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- B: T1133-External Remote Services
- C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Execution:**
- The report mentions that the Tuyul botnet executes commands on victim systems using functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl'. This aligns with the T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter technique, but this is not the initial access method.

**Persistence:**
- The malware downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure persistence, which is a post-compromise technique.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines and employs PHP web shells. This is a post-compromise technique for maintaining access and evading detection.

**Command and Control:**
- The botnet uses a C&C server, which is a post-compromise technique for maintaining control over the infected systems.

**Initial Access:**
- The report does not explicitly state the initial access method. However, given the context of the botnet's functionalities and the use of PHP web shells, it is likely that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application or through external remote services.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. Given the use of PHP web shells and the nature of the botnet, this is a plausible initial access method.
- **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., SSH, RDP) to gain initial access. This is also a plausible method, especially given the use of reverse shells and the nature of the botnet.
- **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique is used for process injection and is not an initial access method.
- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique is used for executing commands and scripts, which is a post-compromise technique.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The Tuyul botnet uses functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl' to execute commands on victim systems, which aligns with the T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter technique. However, this is a post-compromise technique.
- The initial access method is not explicitly stated in the report, but given the use of PHP web shells and the nature of the botnet, it is likely that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application or through external remote services.
- Between T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1133-External Remote Services, both are plausible, but T1190 is more likely given the use of web shells and the nature of the botnet.

**Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
