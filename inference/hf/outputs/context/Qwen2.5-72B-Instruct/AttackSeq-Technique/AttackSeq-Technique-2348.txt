### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT targets NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia using phishing lures.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops and uses custom and publicly available tools, including PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession are used for execution.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The group elevates privileges and installs malware on a large proportion of systems, using tools like vssadmin to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files.
   - **Credential Access:** Credentials are collected from high-privilege accounts and NTDS.dit files.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands are used to understand the network environment.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Wmiexec and net commands are used to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** Custom batch scripts are used to collect and archive specific data types.
   - **Command and Control:** C2 techniques vary based on the remote access tools used.
   - **Exfiltration:** Tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike are used to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after BRONZE PRESIDENT took steps to minimize detection by deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing:** This technique involves modifying command-line arguments to disguise malicious activity. It is not directly related to minimizing detection by deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.
   - **T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to minimizing detection by deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.
   - **T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information. It is not related to minimizing detection by deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This includes actions like deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes to minimize detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses vssadmin to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files for credential access.
   - After gaining access and performing their activities, the group would likely take steps to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.
   - The technique that aligns with these actions is T1070-Indicator Removal, which involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
