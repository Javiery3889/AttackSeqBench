### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems, but no specific techniques are mentioned.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers used domain parking and had access to private web servers.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002).
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569).
   - **Persistence:** No specific details, but the attackers maintained a foothold.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details, but they had high system access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Techniques used include T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497.
   - **Credential Access:** Valid accounts (T1078) were used.
   - **Lateral Movement:** No specific details, but they moved through the network.
   - **Collection:** No specific details, but they focused on information theft.
   - **Command and Control:** Techniques used include T1071 and T1568.
   - **Exfiltration:** No specific details, but they aimed to steal data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage, not destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used after the attackers successfully evaded defenses using Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1553).
   - The goal is to gather internal system information to further their objectives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a session to gain access to a remote service. It is not directly related to gathering internal system information.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. It is a common step in the attack chain to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves stealing the NTDS.dit file to extract password hashes. It is more related to credential access rather than gathering general system information.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network. It is useful for understanding the network topology and identifying potential targets for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have already evaded defenses using Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1553).
   - The next logical step would be to gather information about the internal system to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** and **T1018-Remote System Discovery** are both relevant to this goal.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** is more focused on understanding the processes running on a single system, which is useful for identifying specific targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** is broader and helps in understanding the network topology, which is crucial for planning lateral movement and identifying other systems to target.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
