### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT28 uses spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs to harvest credentials or deliver exploit documents.
- They exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255 to install malware.

**Execution:**
- Malware is executed through spear-phishing emails that deliver exploit documents.
- Malware tools include GAMEFISH, CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE, OLDBAIT, and CORESHELL.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Use of zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
- Preference for using tools already present in the victim's system.

**Credential Access:**
- Harvest credentials through spear-phishing, fake login pages, and malicious applications.
- Use of credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

**Others:**
- APT28 is attributed to the Russian Government and has been active since 2007.
- Targets political entities, governments, militaries, and other organizations.
- Involved in data leaks and false flag operations.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After harvesting credentials via spear-phishing and employing OLDBAIT, which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks following their exploitation of internet-facing servers?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
- B: T1021.007-Cloud Services
- C: T1653-Power Settings
- D: T1564-Hide Artifacts

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs.
2. **Execution:** Malware execution through exploit documents.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Use of zero-day vulnerabilities and legitimate tools.
4. **Credential Access:** Harvesting credentials using spear-phishing and OLDBAIT.
5. **Lateral Movement:** Using legitimate tools for deeper network access.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems.
  - Given that APT28 exploits vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers and uses legitimate tools for lateral movement, this is a strong candidate.

- **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services:**
  - This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network.
  - The report does not mention the use of cloud services for lateral movement, making this less likely.

- **C: T1653-Power Settings:**
  - This technique involves manipulating power settings to maintain persistence or evade detection.
  - The report does not mention power settings manipulation, making this less likely.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts:**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection.
  - While APT28 does use defense evasion techniques, the question specifically asks about moving deeper into the network, which is more aligned with lateral movement.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials and employs OLDBAIT for credential harvesting.
- After gaining initial access and executing malware, they exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers.
- They use legitimate tools for lateral movement to move deeper into the network.
- The most plausible technique for moving deeper into the network after exploiting internet-facing servers is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

**Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
