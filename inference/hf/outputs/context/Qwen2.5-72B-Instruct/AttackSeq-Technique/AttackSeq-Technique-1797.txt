### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks to gather information and compromise over 40 PCs and servers.
- **Initial Access**: The initial penetration vector was social engineering through spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.
- **Execution**: The attackers used fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads.
- **Persistence**: They established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The attackers used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion**: They exploited DLL hijacking vulnerabilities and used DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication.
- **Credential Access**: They harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
- **Discovery**: They performed lateral movement and infected new machines.
- **Lateral Movement**: They expanded control using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
- **Command and Control**: They used HTTP and DNS Tunneling and a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
- **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1218.013-Mavinject**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process using the `mavinject` tool. This is a post-compromise technique and does not fit the context of initial access.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. This aligns with the initial access method described in the CTI report.
- **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing or acquiring tools and capabilities. While this is a preparatory step, it is not directly related to the initial access method described.
- **T1587.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware. This is a post-compromise technique and does not fit the context of initial access.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report clearly states that the initial access was gained through social engineering via spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.
- The technique T1566-Phishing directly corresponds to this method of initial access.
- The other techniques (T1218.013-Mavinject, T1587-Develop Capabilities, and T1587.003-Digital Certificates) are either post-compromise techniques or preparatory steps that do not directly relate to the initial access method described.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
