### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Resource Development**: The report discusses the identification and tracking of malicious C2 infrastructure, including servers used for various toolkits, custom malware, and RATs.
- **Command and Control**: Over 10,000 unique C2 servers were observed, with Cobalt Strike Team Servers, Meterpreter, Metasploit, QakBot, and TrickBot being the most commonly observed.
- **Others**: The report anticipates further insulation and modification of C2 servers to avoid detection and suggests various mitigations.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after threat actors acquired servers through compromise or legitimate purchase and used them to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control purposes.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target network. It does not directly relate to the configuration of C2 infrastructure.
- **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves acquiring tools, exploits, malware, and other capabilities to support the execution of an attack. While it is a part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not specifically address the configuration of C2 infrastructure.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access and control systems. It is more relevant to the initial access and remote control of systems but not specifically to the configuration of C2 infrastructure.
- **T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**: This technique involves adding accounts to local or domain groups to gain elevated privileges. It is more relevant to privilege escalation and maintaining persistence but not to the configuration of C2 infrastructure.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the configuration of C2 infrastructure after acquiring servers. The most relevant technique in this context is **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**. This technique involves acquiring the necessary tools and capabilities to set up and configure the C2 infrastructure.
- While **T1133-External Remote Services** and **T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups** are important in the attack lifecycle, they do not directly address the configuration of C2 infrastructure.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is not relevant to the configuration of C2 infrastructure.

### Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
