### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance:**
  - **Masscan:** Used to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
  - **Shodan and Censys:** Specialized search engines used to find publicly available resources of medical organizations.
  - **Discovery of Non-Trivial Ports and Services:**
    - Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol.
    - Printers with web interfaces without authentication.
    - Outdated medical devices supporting MQTT protocol.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:** After utilizing masscan and search engines like Shodan and Censys during reconnaissance to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when outdated medical devices supporting MQTT protocol were discovered online?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
  - B: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery
  - C: T1606.001-Web Cookies
  - D: T1135-Network Share Discovery

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, network topology, and network services. While this is part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more general and does not specifically target the discovery of specific devices or protocols.

- **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery:**
  - This technique involves identifying and mapping peripheral devices connected to the network, such as printers, cameras, and other IoT devices. The discovery of outdated medical devices supporting MQTT protocol fits well under this category, as these devices are often peripheral and can be discovered using the same methods.

- **T1606.001-Web Cookies:**
  - This technique involves stealing web cookies to gain unauthorized access to web applications. It is not relevant to the discovery of network devices or protocols.

- **T1135-Network Share Discovery:**
  - This technique involves identifying and mapping network shares and drives. While it is part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more focused on file shares and network drives, not specific devices or protocols.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report mentions the use of masscan and specialized search engines to identify potential entry points, including outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol.
  - The discovery of these devices aligns with the technique of identifying and mapping peripheral devices connected to the network.
  - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that occurred when outdated medical devices supporting MQTT protocol were discovered online is **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
