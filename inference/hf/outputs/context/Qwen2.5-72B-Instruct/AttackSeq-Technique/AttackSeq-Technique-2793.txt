### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- It runs in the background and hides its icon on iOS 7.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to send the collected information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**

A: **T1614 - System Location Discovery**
- This technique involves determining the physical or logical location of a system.
- It does not involve sending data out.

B: **T1132 - Data Encoding**
- This technique involves encoding data to make it less conspicuous or to bypass security mechanisms.
- Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data.

C: **T1090.004 - Domain Fronting**
- This technique involves using a different domain in the request headers than the domain being requested to obfuscate the true destination of the traffic.
- It is not directly related to encoding data.

D: **T1195.001 - Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
- This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to gain access to a system.
- It does not involve sending data out.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report describes the malware collecting various types of sensitive information.
- The question specifically asks about sending this information out using Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.
- **T1132 - Data Encoding** is the most relevant technique because it involves encoding data to make it less conspicuous or to bypass security mechanisms.
- Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data, and the use of a random prefix can help further obfuscate the data.

**Final Answer: B: T1132 - Data Encoding**
