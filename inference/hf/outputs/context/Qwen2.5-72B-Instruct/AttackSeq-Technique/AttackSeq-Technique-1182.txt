### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious delivery documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
- Payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded from the internet.
- A Java downloader is used in some cases.

**Execution:**
- Macros enable the payload execution.
- Two files are created in the ProgramData directory.
- A VBS script executes a PowerShell script.
- Task scheduler is used for persistence.
- PowerShell script is obfuscated and divided into three parts.
- Backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Persistence:**
- Path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Obfuscation techniques are used.
- Publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

**Discovery:**
- Backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Collection:**
- Backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Others:**
- Attackers monitor C&C server connections.
- False flags and error messages in simplified Mandarin Chinese.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the backdoor collects machine information and screenshots to send data to the C&C server, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
- C: T1102-Web Service
- D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- This data is sent to a C&C server.
- The communication with the C&C server is likely encrypted and involves querying external services.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not mentioned in the report.
- **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is not relevant to the communication with the C&C server.
- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C&C server, which aligns with the report's description of sending data to a C&C server.
- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools to the victim's system, which is not mentioned in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and screenshots.
- This data is sent to a C&C server.
- The communication with the C&C server is likely encrypted and involves querying external services.
- The most plausible technique for this communication is T1102-Web Service, as it involves using web services to communicate with a C&C server.

**Final Answer:**
C: T1102-Web Service
