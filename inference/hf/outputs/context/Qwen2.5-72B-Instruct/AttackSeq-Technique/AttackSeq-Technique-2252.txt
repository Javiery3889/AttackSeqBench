### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India.
   - **Resource Development:** Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and uses phishing portals to steal credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and self-extracting RAR-based droppers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Sets up fake or compromised websites to deliver malware.
   - **Exfiltration:** Targets Kavach MFA app and uses njRAT malware with special victim IDs to exfiltrate authentication databases.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after SideCopy used njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception:** This technique involves intercepting MFA tokens or codes. While SideCopy targets Kavach, an MFA app, the report does not specifically mention intercepting MFA tokens or codes.
   - **T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate websites or applications. The report mentions cloned websites but not content injection.
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or credentials. The report mentions keyloggers and credential stealers, which align with this technique.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from the victim's system. The report explicitly mentions using njRAT malware and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that SideCopy uses njRAT malware and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data from the victim's system to the attacker's system.
   - The technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration directly aligns with the described exfiltration activities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
