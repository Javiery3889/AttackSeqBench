### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Bitter APT group targets users in Bangladesh, specifically high-ranking officers of the Rapid Action Battalion Unit of the Bangladesh police (RAB).
- The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a themed lure document.
- The lure document is either a malicious RTF document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
- These documents exploit known vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802) to run embedded shellcode.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
- B: T1197-BITS Jobs
- C: T1566-Phishing
- D: T1090-Proxy

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spear-phishing email with a themed lure document.
   - Malicious RTF or Excel document.
   - Exploitation of known vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802).

**Post-Exploitation:**
- The question asks about a technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:**
  - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While it can be used to obfuscate data, it is not specifically about concealing the identity of a C2 server.
- **B: T1197-BITS Jobs:**
  - This technique uses Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs to transfer files. It is not directly related to concealing the identity of a C2 server.
- **C: T1566-Phishing:**
  - This technique is about the initial access method (spear-phishing emails). It does not address post-exploitation communication.
- **D: T1090-Proxy:**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server, which can effectively conceal the identity of the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious document.
2. The document exploits known vulnerabilities to run shellcode.
3. Post-exploitation, the threat actor needs to communicate with the C2 server.
4. To conceal the identity of the C2 server, the most likely technique is to use a proxy (T1090).

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
