### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A new series of malware samples were submitted to online sandboxes.
- The initial dropper malware, written in Delphi, downloads a second stage payload from the internet and executes it.
- The payload communicates with the server using the HTTPS protocol.

**Execution:**
- The malware initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server.
- It downloads the file 'upnphost.exe' to the path '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp'.
- The executable implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key.

**Persistence:**
- The executable 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain its foothold on the system.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The 'upnphost.exe' file was submitted to Virus Total, likely due to the evasion technique implemented by the dropper.
- The dropper was patched to reveal its complete malicious behavior.

**Discovery:**
- The malware sends information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- The server is located in Hong Kong according to WHOIS records.

**Others:**
- The attack threat map indicates a wide attack surface with C2Cs in Europe and China.
- Yara rules are provided for the dropper, first payload 'upnphost.exe', and second payload 'sdbn.dll' associated with APT28 XAGENT July 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the malware sent system information to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during its communication with the C2 server leveraging HTTPS with a POST method?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver
- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
- D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS.
- The communication involves sending system information to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line.

**Evaluating the Answer Choices:**

- **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
  - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C2 server. However, the report does not mention any dead drop resolver or similar mechanism.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. The report explicitly states that the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol.

- **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malware. The report does not mention any software deployment tools being used for communication with the C2 server.

- **D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
  - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state. The report does not mention any cloud instances or reverting actions.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol.
- The report explicitly states that the communication involves sending system information to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line.
- The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with this behavior is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
