### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents to download a Cobalt Strike beacon.
- **Execution**: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, and delete files.
- **Persistence**: Established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Found admin-level credentials and compromised a Domain Administrator account.
- **Defense Evasion**: Minimized detection by operating outside business hours and using single workstations as a hub.
- **Credential Access**: Compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise more endpoints.
- **Discovery**: Used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, collect administrative credentials, and compromise additional endpoints.
- **Lateral Movement**: Moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
- **Command and Control**: Used Cobalt Strike beacon for communication with compromised systems.
- **Exfiltration**: Prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks: "Once the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after they compromised numerous workstations and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise, which is more related to defense evasion and not directly tied to the search for critical information.
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the attackers' goal of finding critical information.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is more related to credential access and not directly tied to the search for critical information.
- **T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**: This technique involves spoofing DHCP responses to control network configurations, which is not directly related to the search for critical information.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
- After compromising these systems, the next logical step would be to search for and collect critical information.
- The technique that best aligns with this activity is **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**, as it involves collecting data from information repositories, which is consistent with the attackers' goal of finding and exfiltrating critical information.

**Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
