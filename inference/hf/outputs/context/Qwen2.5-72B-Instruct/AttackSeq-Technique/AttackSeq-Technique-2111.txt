### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** A scheduled task named 'Windows Update' was created to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques were employed, and the loader used dynamic API resolving to hide its main functionality.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using an encrypted protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, including screenshots, files, and system information.
   - **Impact:** The backdoor had the capability to shut down the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details for assessment during discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1070.003-Clear Command History:** This technique involves clearing the command history to avoid detection. It is not directly related to data acquisition.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is more related to the initial stages of the attack rather than data acquisition.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data:** This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data before exfiltration. While this could be part of the exfiltration process, it is not the immediate next step after discovery.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the attackers' actions after gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details for assessment during the discovery phase.
   - After gathering this information, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect data from the local system, which is a crucial part of the surveillance objectives.
   - The technique T1005-Data from Local System fits this description as it involves collecting data from the local system, which is a necessary step before exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System
