### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uses web shells and JSP tools to exfiltrate data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 used lateral movement methods like WMI and BUSTEDPIPE to access additional systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE to move laterally within the network.
   - **Post-Lateral Movement Actions:**
     - **T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is not mentioned as a primary post-lateral movement action in the report.
     - **T1123-Audio Capture:** This technique involves capturing audio, which is not mentioned in the report.
     - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which is explicitly mentioned in the report as a method used by FIN13.
     - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is not specifically mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - After gaining access to additional systems via lateral movement, the next logical step for FIN13 would be to exfiltrate the data they have collected.
   - The report clearly states that FIN13 uses web shells and JSP tools to exfiltrate data over web services.
   - The other options (keylogging, audio capture, and data from network shared drives) are not mentioned as primary actions taken after lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
