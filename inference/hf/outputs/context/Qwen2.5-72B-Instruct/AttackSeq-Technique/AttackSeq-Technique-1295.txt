### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Spear-phishing emails
- Strategic Web compromises
- Targets are enticed to open attachments containing Poison Ivy server code or redirected to exploit-laden websites.

**Execution:**
- Poison Ivy builder kit allows attackers to customize and build their own Poison Ivy server.
- The server is delivered as mobile code to a compromised target.
- The server executes on the target's endpoint and connects to the attacker's client, giving them control of the system.

**Persistence:**
- If the 'persistence' option is enabled, a watchdog thread is injected into explorer.exe.
- This watchdog thread automatically restarts the Poison Ivy server process if it is unexpectedly terminated.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key.
- This encryption may blend in with normal network activity, especially when using port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

**Others:**
- Poison Ivy (PIVY) is a RAT that remains popular and effective.
- FireEye has released Calamine to help detect and examine Poison Ivy infections.
- Analysis of 194 Poison Ivy samples used in targeted attacks, extracting passwords, mutexes, and CnC infrastructure.
- Insights into the tools, tactics, and procedures of the attackers, exploring campaign connections and enabling defenders to better secure their networks.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After establishing persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain the Poison Ivy server process, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation
- B: T1090-Proxy
- C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution
- D: T1573-Encrypted Channel

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Persistence:**
- The report mentions that a watchdog thread is injected into explorer.exe to maintain the Poison Ivy server process. This aligns with the persistence technique T1546-Event Triggered Execution, but the question is asking about the next step after persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report states that Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key. This encryption is designed to blend in with normal network activity, especially when using port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**
- **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation** - This technique is not relevant to securing communication or network traffic.
- **B: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, but it does not specifically address encryption.
- **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution** - This technique is about persistence, which has already been established in the report.
- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encryption to secure network communications, which aligns with the report's description of Poison Ivy's network communications being encrypted using the Camellia cipher.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key.
- This encryption is designed to blend in with normal network activity, especially when using port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.
- The question asks about the technique used to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
- The most relevant technique that matches this description is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer:**
D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
