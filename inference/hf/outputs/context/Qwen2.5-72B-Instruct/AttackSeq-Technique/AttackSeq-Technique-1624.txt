### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT28 scans for targets using a distributed bot network.
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The second stage component is installed by a dropper, which writes key components to the disk and deploys tools.
   - **Persistence:** File timestamps are changed to hide the files.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** A tool exploiting CVE-2014-4076 is used to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** File timestamps are changed, and a proxy tool is used to contact internal systems.
   - **Credential Access:** A password dumping tool based on mimikatz is used.
   - **Discovery:** The environment is scanned for vulnerable systems.
   - **Collection:** Additional modules like pr.dll are deployed to collect data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll` during data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C&C servers. While it is a common method, the report does not specifically mention the use of web protocols for secure communication.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C&C communications from detection. The report mentions the use of a proxy tool to contact systems behind routers, which suggests a need for secure communication.
   - **T1218.014-MMC:** This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute malicious code. It does not relate to secure communication with C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report mentions the use of a proxy tool (`svehost.exe`) to contact systems behind routers, which implies a need for secure communication to avoid detection.
   - The use of a proxy tool to facilitate communication with internal systems suggests that APT28 is likely using encrypted channels to ensure the security of their C&C communications.
   - The other techniques (T1569, T1071.001, T1218.014) do not align as closely with the need for secure communication as T1573.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
