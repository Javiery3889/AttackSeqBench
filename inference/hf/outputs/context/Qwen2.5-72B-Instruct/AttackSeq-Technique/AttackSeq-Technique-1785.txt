### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing.
- **Resource Development**: Developed sophisticated tools, including backdoors and custom-built tools.
- **Initial Access**: Used spear-phishing emails with links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with macros.
- **Execution**: Operated a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads from offensive frameworks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion**: Exploited DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
- **Credential Access**: Harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
- **Discovery**: Performed lateral movement and infected new machines.
- **Lateral Movement**: Used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
- **Command and Control**: Used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
- **Exfiltration**: Used a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook to exfiltrate data.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure after the execution of PowerShell scripts to load additional payloads and scripts from the command-and-control server.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it is used to execute the initial PowerShell scripts, it does not specifically facilitate the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **T1137.003-Outlook Forms**: This technique involves using Outlook forms to execute code. While the OceanLotus Group used a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook, this specific sub-technique is not mentioned in the report.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This could be used to maintain persistence, but the report does not specifically mention this technique in the context of the fileless in-memory payload delivery.
- **T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**: This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate files. While the OceanLotus Group used DLL hijacking to evade detection, this specific sub-technique is not mentioned in the context of the fileless in-memory payload delivery.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The report mentions that the OceanLotus Group used a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads to load additional scripts or fetch payloads from the command-and-control server.
- To maintain the continuous operation of this fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure, the attackers likely used a technique to ensure that the PowerShell scripts and payloads were executed at system boot or user logon.
- The most plausible technique for this purpose is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique would allow the attackers to set up mechanisms to execute their PowerShell scripts and maintain persistence in the system.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
