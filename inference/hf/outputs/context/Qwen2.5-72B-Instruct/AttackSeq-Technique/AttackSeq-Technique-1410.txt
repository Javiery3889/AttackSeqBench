### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Tactic:** Initial Access
- **Technique:** T1566 - Phishing
- **Description:** Attackers impersonated technical support or friends and used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages. These messages contained generic greetings and claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface.

**Credential Access:**
- **Tactic:** Credential Access
- **Technique:** T1552 - Unsecured Credentials
- **Description:** The attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials. After obtaining these details, they changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners. They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.
