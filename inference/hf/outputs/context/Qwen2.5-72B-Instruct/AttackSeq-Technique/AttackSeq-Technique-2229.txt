### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC and modifying system processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner to discover machines in the network.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives, and used tools like WinRAR and megacmd for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems, including encrypted channels and protocol tunneling.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files into archives and used cloud services for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after deploying scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner for network Discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations, which aligns with the use of scanning tools to discover machines and services in the network.
   - **T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls:** This technique involves using ptrace system calls to manipulate processes, which is not directly related to network discovery.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves tricking internal users to gain access, which is not a logical next step after network discovery.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services, which is a logical next step after discovering network services and their configurations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Network Discovery (T1046):** Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner to discover machines and services in the network. This is the initial step in understanding the network topology.
   - **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210):** After discovering the network services, the next logical step is to exploit any vulnerabilities in these services to gain further access and move laterally within the network.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
