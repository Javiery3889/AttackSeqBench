### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy APT targets government personnel in India using decoys and honeytraps.
   - **Resource Development:** SideCopy mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and develops phishing portals to trick victims into divulging credentials.
   - **Execution:** SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins post-infection.
   - **Persistence:** SideCopy uses various techniques to maintain persistence, including LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** SideCopy uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Credential Access:** SideCopy focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Discovery:** SideCopy uses themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** SideCopy uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** SideCopy uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - **Exfiltration:** SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases and other credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after SideCopy developed resources such as phishing portals and before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** This phase involves creating the tools and infrastructure, such as phishing portals.
   - **Initial Access:** This phase involves using the developed resources to gain initial access to the target systems, which could include phishing attacks.
   - **Execution:** This phase involves running the malware or tools on the target system, which happens after gaining initial access.
   - **Persistence:** This phase involves maintaining access to the system, which typically follows initial access and execution.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This phase involves gaining higher-level permissions, which can occur after initial access and execution but is not necessarily the next step.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after developing the phishing portals (Resource Development), the next logical step is to use these portals to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - Once initial access is gained, the APT group can then deploy RATs and post-infection plugins (Execution).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
