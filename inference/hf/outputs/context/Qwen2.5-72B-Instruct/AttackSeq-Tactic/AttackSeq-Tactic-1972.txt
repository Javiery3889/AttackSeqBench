### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.
   - **Initial Access:** Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 in WinRAR via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Elfin deployed various custom and commodity malware.
   - **Persistence:** Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging and deployed various tools.
   - **Credential Access:** Elfin used DarkComet to extract credentials.
   - **Exfiltration:** Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet and before data was exfiltrated using FastUploader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (A):** This is the tactic where Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet.
   - **Persistence (B):** This involves creating a scheduled task to ensure the malware runs repeatedly.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This involves the initial entry into the system, which in this case was via the WinRAR exploit.

   Given the sequence of events:
   - **Credential Access** (extracting credentials using DarkComet) is already identified.
   - **Exfiltration** (using FastUploader) is the next step.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred between these two steps.

   The most logical step between extracting credentials and exfiltrating data is establishing and maintaining **Command and Control** over the compromised system. This is necessary to ensure that the attacker can continue to interact with the system and manage the exfiltration process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Elfin established **Command and Control** after extracting credentials and before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
