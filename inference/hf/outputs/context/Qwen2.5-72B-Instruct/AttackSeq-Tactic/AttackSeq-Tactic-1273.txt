### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and in-memory malware, and removed disk-resident tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools and techniques for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to scan and map targets.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, after using SharpHound to scan and map targets during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This phase involves using tools like SharpHound to scan and map targets.
   - **Initial Access:** This phase involves gaining initial access to the network, which has already occurred.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This phase involves moving through the network to access additional systems, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - **Command and Control:** This phase involves establishing a channel to control the compromised system, which is the final step mentioned in the report.

   The sequence of events in the report is:
   - Initial Access
   - Execution
   - Persistence
   - Privilege Escalation
   - Defense Evasion
   - Credential Access
   - Discovery
   - Command and Control

   After the Discovery phase, the next logical step in the attack sequence is Command and Control. However, the question specifically asks what occurred before Command and Control, and the most plausible answer is the Discovery phase itself, as it is the immediate preceding step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is that the Discovery phase occurred before Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
