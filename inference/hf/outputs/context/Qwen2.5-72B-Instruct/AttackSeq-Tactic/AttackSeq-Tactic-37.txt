### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
- Documents designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Initial Access:**
- Phishing emails with a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
- Document contained VBS macros.

**Execution:**
- Opening the document triggers a VBS macro.
- Macro calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
- PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab).

**Defense Evasion:**
- PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
- Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
- Leverages DCOM object to execute files without saving to disk.

**Impact:**
- GandCrab ransomware encrypts files.
- Ursnif performs credential harvesting, gathers system and process information, and potentially deploys additional malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the PowerShell script avoided detection by operating in memory and leveraged the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Credential Access
- B: Defense Evasion
- C: Execution
- D: Command and Control

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the Report:**
- The PowerShell script avoids detection by operating in memory.
- It uses a DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.

**Tactics to Consider:**
- **Defense Evasion:** The script avoids detection and uses techniques to execute files without writing to disk.
- **Execution:** The script downloads and runs the payloads.
- **Credential Access:** Not directly mentioned in the context of the PowerShell script's actions.
- **Command and Control:** Not directly mentioned in the context of the PowerShell script's actions.

**Evaluation:**
- The PowerShell script's actions of avoiding detection and executing files without writing to disk are clear examples of **Defense Evasion**.
- The execution of the payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) is a separate step that occurs after the defense evasion techniques are applied.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
2. It uses a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
3. These actions are designed to evade detection and are part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
4. The execution of the payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) is a subsequent step that occurs after the defense evasion techniques are applied.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
