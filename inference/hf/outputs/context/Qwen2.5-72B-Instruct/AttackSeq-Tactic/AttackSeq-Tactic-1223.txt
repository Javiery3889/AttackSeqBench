### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attackers sent crafted emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
- **Execution**: The malicious attachments installed the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan, which then contacted a C&C server.
- **Credential Access**: The PoisonIvy Trojan dumped Windows cached password hashes.
- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers used the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network.
- **Collection**: The attackers copied sensitive intellectual property to internal staging servers.
- **Exfiltration**: The collected data was uploaded to a remote site outside the organization.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code after the attackers used the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes and prepared collected intellectual property for exfiltration.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Impact**: This tactic involves altering or disrupting a system's normal operations. It does not fit the scenario of maintaining communication with a C&C server.
- **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data out of a network. While it is part of the attack sequence, it does not describe maintaining communication with a C&C server.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. The report mentions that the PoisonIvy Trojan contacted a C&C server using an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80, which fits this description.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to systems over extended periods. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it does not specifically describe the communication with a C&C server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The report clearly states that the PoisonIvy Trojan contacted a C&C server using an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80. This communication is essential for the attackers to command the compromised computer and retrieve binary code.
- The ATT&CK tactic that best describes this communication is **Command and Control (C2)**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
