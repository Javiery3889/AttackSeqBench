### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks.
   - **Resource Development:** They developed a sophisticated arsenal of tools.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
   - **Execution:** They used fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts.
   - **Persistence:** They established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They exploited DLL hijacking and used DNS Tunneling.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They performed lateral movement and infected new machines.
   - **Command and Control:** They used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrated data using a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks, and before they exfiltrated data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it is not the immediate next step after using stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. The report mentions that the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for lateral movement, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is used throughout the attack, it is not the immediate next step after using stolen credentials for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools to infect new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks. This is a clear indication of **Lateral Movement**.
   - After infecting new machines, the next logical step in the attack sequence is to establish and maintain control over the compromised systems, which is part of **Command and Control**.
   - Finally, they exfiltrated data using a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook, which is the **Exfiltration** phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
