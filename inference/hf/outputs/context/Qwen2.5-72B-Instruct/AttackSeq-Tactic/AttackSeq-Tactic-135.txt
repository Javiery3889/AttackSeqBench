### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop various malicious samples. They also acquired infrastructure such as domains and servers from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY.
   - **Execution:** They used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** They created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. They also used DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, and obfuscated files or information.
   - **Credential Access:** They used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files in specified directories.
   - **Collection:** They read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after FamousSparrow engaged in Resource Development by exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities to acquire infrastructure such as domains and servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development** involves the initial steps of acquiring the necessary resources and infrastructure to carry out the attack.
   - After acquiring the infrastructure, the next logical step is to gain **Initial Access** to the target systems. This is typically done by exploiting vulnerabilities, which is exactly what FamousSparrow did by using known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Execution** follows **Initial Access**. Once the initial access is gained, the attacker can execute commands to install and run the backdoor (SparrowDoor).
   - **Impact** and **Reconnaissance** are not immediate next steps after Resource Development. **Impact** typically occurs much later in the attack chain, and **Reconnaissance** is more about gathering information before the attack, which is not the immediate next step after acquiring infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after Resource Development is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
