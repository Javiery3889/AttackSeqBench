### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attack began with malicious documents authored by 'Richard' and distributed via an IP address in the United States and through Dropbox. These documents contained a malicious macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
- **Execution**: The shellcode executed by the macro in winword.exe acted as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant. It resolved Libraries and APIs, downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document, and executed both payloads.
- **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
- **Discovery**: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
- **Command and Control**: The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, sending data in various formats encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
- **Exfiltration**: The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity and gathering information for potential exploitation, but before the malicious macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which in this case is through the malicious documents distributed via an IP address and Dropbox.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information for potential exploitation, which aligns with the initial masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the execution of the malicious macro, which injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
- **Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or system disruption, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The attack begins with the distribution of malicious documents, which is part of the **Initial Access** tactic.
2. Before the malicious macro is executed, the threat actors likely gathered information to make the documents appear legitimate and to identify potential targets. This is part of the **Reconnaissance** tactic.
3. The malicious macro is then executed, which injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word, which is part of the **Execution** tactic.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial masquerading and gathering of information but before the execution of the malicious macro is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
