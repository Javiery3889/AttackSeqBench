### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: Emissary Panda identified systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
- **Initial Access**: Exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells on SharePoint servers.
- **Execution**: Uploaded tools including Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro.
- **Persistence**: Installed webshells (Antak, China Chopper, stylecs.aspx, stylecss.aspx, test.aspx) for persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and maintained access with China Chopper.
- **Discovery**: Performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.
- **Lateral Movement**: Moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
- **Command and Control**: Used HyperBro backdoor for C2 over HTTPS.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks: "After Emissary Panda installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the actors used tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: Webshells were installed for persistence.
- **Next Step**: The actors used tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network.

To determine the most likely tactic that occurred before using Mimikatz, we need to consider the logical sequence of actions:
- **Credential Access**: Mimikatz is a tool primarily used for credential access, specifically to extract credentials from memory.
- **Defense Evasion**: This involves techniques to avoid detection, which is a continuous process but not a prerequisite for using Mimikatz.
- **Reconnaissance**: This is an initial phase and not typically a step taken after persistence.
- **Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network, which is necessary before moving laterally but not directly related to using Mimikatz.

Given that Mimikatz is used to extract credentials, the most logical step before using it would be to perform **Credential Access**.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Persistence**: Webshells were installed to maintain access.
- **Next Step**: The actors needed to gather credentials to move laterally.
- **Credential Access**: Using Mimikatz to extract credentials is a direct step in this process.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
