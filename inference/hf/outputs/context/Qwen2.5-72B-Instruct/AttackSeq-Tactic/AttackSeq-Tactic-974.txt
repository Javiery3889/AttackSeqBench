### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, such as a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
- **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's to execute the payload.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Credential Access**: The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
- **Discovery**: It searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
- **Exfiltration**: The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP and WebDav.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after CosmicDuke collected information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, specifically to enable communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and to exfiltrate data via FTP and WebDav servers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is already described in the report.
- **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring the collected data to a remote location, which is also described in the report.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive commands or exfiltrate data. The report mentions that the malware uses HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav to exfiltrate data, which aligns with C2 activities.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the infection, which is not mentioned in the report.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running the malware, which is already covered in the initial stages of the attack.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Collection**: The report clearly states that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
2. **Exfiltration**: The report also states that the collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP and WebDav.
3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The report mentions that the malware uses HTTP GET requests to communicate with remote servers, which is a key aspect of C2. This communication is necessary to exfiltrate the data.

Given that the question specifically asks about the tactic that enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltrates data via FTP and WebDav, the most appropriate answer is **Command and Control (C2)**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
