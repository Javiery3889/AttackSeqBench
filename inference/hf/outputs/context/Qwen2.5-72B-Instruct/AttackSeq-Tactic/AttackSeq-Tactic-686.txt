### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan is executed, containing a main executable binary and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:** The Explosive Trojan is installed with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan avoids detection by AV tools and merges into the system.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network, and recent versions of the Trojan have a USB infection option.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report indicates that after gaining initial access and executing the Explosive Trojan, the attackers use the infected server as a pivot to spread manually across the network.
   - This spreading activity is described as "Lateral Movement" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic refers to the initial entry point into the network, which has already occurred.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves spreading from the initial infected server to other parts of the network, which aligns with the described activity.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems, which is not the immediate next step after spreading.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code, which has already been done.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
