### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
   - **Command and Control:** The stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043, T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after the attacker deleted the original malicious file (T1107) and employed hidden directories (T1158).
   - The specific action mentioned is targeting registry keys for stored passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1107 (File Deletion) and T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories):** These are part of the Defense Evasion phase.
   - **Targeting registry keys for stored passwords:** This action is related to Credential Access (T1552 - Unsecured Credentials).

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:** This involves gathering data from the system, which is already mentioned in the report (T1005).
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This is already part of the sequence (T1107, T1158, T1045).
   - **C: Credential Access:** This involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with targeting registry keys for stored passwords (T1552).
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not directly mentioned in the report.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence of events in the CTI report shows that after the initial defense evasion techniques (T1107, T1158), the next logical step would be to access credentials, which is a common tactic in the ATT&CK framework.
- Targeting registry keys for stored passwords is a specific technique under the Credential Access tactic (T1552).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
