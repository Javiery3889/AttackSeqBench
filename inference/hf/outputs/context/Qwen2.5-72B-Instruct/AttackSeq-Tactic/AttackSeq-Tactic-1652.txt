### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India.
   - **Resource Development:** Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and uses phishing portals.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach MFA app.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after SideCopy used njRAT malware with victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect Kavach authentication databases, and then extensively used modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Resource Development:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Execution:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Persistence:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Credential Access:** This is the step where credentials are harvested, but the question asks what happens after this.
   - **Discovery:** Not relevant after the collection of credentials.
   - **Collection:** This is the step where data is gathered, but the question asks what happens after this.
   - **Command and Control:** This is the step where the collected data is sent back to the attacker's server.
   - **Exfiltration:** This is the step where the collected data is transferred out of the victim's network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - After deploying njRAT malware and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect Kavach authentication databases, SideCopy extensively uses modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence is to exfiltrate the collected data (credentials and other sensitive information) from the victim's network to the attacker's server.
   - The ATT&CK tactic that aligns with this step is **Exfiltration**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
