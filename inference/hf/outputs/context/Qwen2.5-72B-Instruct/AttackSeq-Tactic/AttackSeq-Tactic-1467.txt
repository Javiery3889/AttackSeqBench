### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information and use active discovery methods to target potential victims.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign and deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) via weaponized MS Office email attachments.
- Employees enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3.

**Execution:**
- BlackEnergy 3 is installed on employee workstations after macros are enabled.
- The malware begins communication with external Command and Control (CC) servers.

**Credential Access:**
- BlackEnergy 3 plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery.
- Adversaries use stolen credentials to access domain controllers and create new privileged accounts.

**Discovery:**
- Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets.
- Adversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems.

**Command and Control:**
- Malware establishes a connection to attacker-controlled CC servers.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Adversaries use valid credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins to move laterally within the corporate network.
- Adversaries access critical systems in the control environment.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after adversaries conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and before adversaries used malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Reconnaissance:** This occurs before the initial access and is not relevant to the sequence after internal reconnaissance.
- **Initial Access:** This is the initial step of delivering the RAT and is not relevant to the sequence after internal reconnaissance.
- **Execution:** This is the installation of the RAT and the initial communication with CC servers, which occurs before internal reconnaissance.
- **Credential Access:** This involves harvesting credentials and is part of the internal reconnaissance process.
- **Discovery:** This is the internal reconnaissance itself, which is the step we are starting from.
- **Command and Control:** This is the establishment of a connection to CC servers, which occurs after the initial execution and is not directly related to the sequence after internal reconnaissance.
- **Lateral Movement:** This involves using valid credentials to move within the network and access critical systems, which is the next logical step after internal reconnaissance.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Internal Reconnaissance (Discovery):** Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the control environment to identify critical systems.
- **Lateral Movement:** After identifying the critical systems, adversaries use valid credentials to move laterally and gain access to these systems.
- **Malicious Updates:** Adversaries then use these accesses to sever connections between the control center and substations.

Given this sequence, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurs after internal reconnaissance and before the use of malicious updates is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
