### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers had detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers acquired and parked domains for future use and had access to private web servers.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers maintained their foothold by being selective and careful.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers had high system access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used T1057 and T1012 to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 and T1568 to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attackers used Discovery techniques (T1057 and T1012) to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network but before they focused on information theft and espionage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This is the tactic that the attackers used to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network. It is the starting point of the sequence in question.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is a logical next step after gaining knowledge about the network and before focusing on information theft.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it is a critical step, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after Discovery.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials. It is also a logical step but is often used in conjunction with or after Lateral Movement to gain deeper access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first used Discovery techniques (T1057 and T1012) to understand the systems and network.
   - After gaining this knowledge, the next logical step would be to move laterally through the network to gain access to more systems and data.
   - Lateral Movement (B) is the most plausible next step because it allows the attackers to expand their access and reach the systems and data they are interested in stealing.
   - Persistence (C) and Credential Access (D) are also important but are typically used to maintain and deepen access, which is a step that follows Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
