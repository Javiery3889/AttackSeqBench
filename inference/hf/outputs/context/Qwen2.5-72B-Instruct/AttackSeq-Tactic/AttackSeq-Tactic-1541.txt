### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures after business hours or on weekends.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
   - **Execution:** The attackers downloaded and executed new payloads, ran shell commands, and deleted files.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials and compromised a Domain Administrator account.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers minimized detection by performing operations outside business hours and using single workstations as a hub.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise more endpoints.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure.
   - **Collection:** The attackers collected and prepared valuable documents for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the final step in the attack sequence after the attackers collected and prepared valuable documents related to internal applications and procedures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the collected documents were prepared for exfiltration.
   - The final step in the attack sequence, after collection, is typically the exfiltration of the data.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves finding and mapping the network, which occurs before the collection of documents.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of collected data out of the network, which is the logical final step after collection.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial compromise, which occurs at the beginning of the attack.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves maintaining communication with the compromised systems, which is ongoing throughout the attack but not the final step.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
