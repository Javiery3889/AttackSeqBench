### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Tortoiseshell created a fake veteran hiring website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com) to conduct reconnaissance.
     - The website prompted users to download an app, which was a malware downloader.
     - The downloaded reconnaissance tool, named 'bird.exe' with the internal name Liderc, collected extensive information from the victim's machine using WMI.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website.
     - The app served as a malware downloader.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware downloader executed two binaries retrieved from a remote server.
     - These binaries included a reconnaissance tool and a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT).
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
     - The RAT was modular and required the installer for access, complicating analysis by researchers.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the RAT executed as a service and maintained persistence on the victim's system, specifically when the RAT communicated with a C2 server using an IP address argument to the service, complicating direct access for researchers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The initial reconnaissance was already completed using the fake website and the reconnaissance tool.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system, which was achieved through the fake app download.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which was done by the malware downloader.
   - **Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system, which was achieved by installing the RAT as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves avoiding detection, which was done by checking if Google was reachable and using a modular RAT.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system, which was done by the reconnaissance tool.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to control the compromised system. The question specifically mentions the RAT communicating with a C2 server using an IP address argument, which aligns with the C2 tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is that the RAT communicated with a C2 server using an IP address argument to the service, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
