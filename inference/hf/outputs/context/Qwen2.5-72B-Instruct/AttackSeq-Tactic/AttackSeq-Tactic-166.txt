### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Execution**: The Lazarus group installed backdoors (BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) on financial institution systems. These backdoors were installed as services and can perform various malicious functions.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to avoid detection after installing backdoors and before connecting to command and control servers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code, which has already been described in the report (installing backdoors).
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure, which is also described in the report.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. Given that the backdoors are installed as services and can perform various functions, it is likely that the attackers used techniques to evade detection.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the attack. The report does not mention any lateral movement activities.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While the backdoors can collect information, this is not the primary focus of the question, which is about avoiding detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoors are installed as services, which is a common technique to ensure persistence and to avoid detection by security tools.
- The backdoors can perform various functions, including collecting information, downloading files, and running in passive mode to receive commands. These functions suggest that the attackers are trying to remain undetected.
- The most likely tactic to avoid detection after installing backdoors and before connecting to command and control servers is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
