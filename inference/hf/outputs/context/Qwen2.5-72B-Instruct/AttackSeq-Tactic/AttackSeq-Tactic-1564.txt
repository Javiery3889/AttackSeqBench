### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** The attack involved the execution of various VBScripts and batch files. Key scripts include 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Persistence:** The 'stopedge.bat' file scheduled 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' was present.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The scripts were heavily obfuscated and managed file deletions to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The 'versioninfo.bat' script discovered information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** The 'versioninfo.bat' script collected information from the user's computer.
   - **Command and Control:** The 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' scripts communicated with the C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The 'unactivate.vbs' script exfiltrated data through a POST request.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Konni delivered an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts from an ITW URL, marking the start of the attack chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system. Delivering an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts from an ITW URL is a method of initial access, often through spear-phishing or other social engineering techniques.
   - **Execution (A):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. The execution of the VBScripts and batch files described in the report is a subsequent step after gaining initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the scripts were obfuscated and managed file deletions, this is a step that occurs after gaining access and executing the initial payload.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The 'versioninfo.bat' script collected information, but this is part of the discovery phase, which occurs after gaining access and executing the initial payload.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack chain starts with the delivery of the ISO file containing the malicious scripts. This is the initial point of contact with the victim's system.
   - After gaining initial access, the scripts are executed, leading to persistence, defense evasion, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most logical first step in the attack chain is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Initial Access
