### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Targeted Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2021-44026) to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access by exploiting Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730.
     - Also exploited Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397.
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious scripts to redirect future incoming emails and perform reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumped OS credentials from compromised systems.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Gathered system information, network configuration, owner/user discovery, and network connections discovery.
   - **Collection:**
     - Created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled address.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated data over alternative protocols, including the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after BlueDelta collected emails by automatically forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address and before it exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled address.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta exfiltrated data over alternative protocols, including the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention any activities related to establishing or maintaining command and control after the collection of emails but before the exfiltration of session cookies and address books.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report does not mention any activities related to resource development after the collection of emails but before the exfiltration of session cookies and address books.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the report is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**
     2. **Initial Access**
     3. **Execution**
     4. **Defense Evasion**
     5. **Credential Access**
     6. **Discovery**
     7. **Collection** (forwarding emails to an attacker-controlled address)
     8. **Exfiltration** (exfiltrating session cookies, address book, and database information)
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the collection of emails and before the exfiltration of session cookies and address books.
   - The only logical step between these two actions is the preparation for exfiltration, which is part of the **Exfiltration** tactic itself.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
