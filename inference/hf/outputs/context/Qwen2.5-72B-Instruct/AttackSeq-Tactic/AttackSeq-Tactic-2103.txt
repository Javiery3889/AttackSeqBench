### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows) to install the Nidiran back door.
   - **Execution:** Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools to infect internal hosts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze and communicate over ports 443 and 8443.
   - **Credential Access:** Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
   - **Command and Control:** Suckfly's Nidiran back door communicated with the C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration:** Suckfly exfiltrated data off the victimâ€™s network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for open ports and hosts to expand its foothold, and then used hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the e-commerce company's internal network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the report.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which has already been completed in the report (scanning for open ports and hosts).
   - **Exfiltration (C):** This tactic involves stealing data, which is the final step in the report and not the next step after scanning and privilege escalation.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's control, which aligns with the use of hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report states that Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports to expand its foothold.
   - After this, Suckfly used hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the network.
   - The use of hacktools to escalate privileges and move through the network is a clear indication of the **Lateral Movement** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
