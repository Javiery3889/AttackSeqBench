### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attackers sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
- **Execution**: The recipients executed the malicious attachments, which installed the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.
- **Credential Access**: The PoisonIvy Trojan dumped Windows cached password hashes.
- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers used the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network.
- **Command and Control**: The PoisonIvy backdoor communicated with a C&C server over TCP port 80.
- **Exfiltration**: The attackers uploaded the collected intellectual property to a remote site.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when the attackers prepared intellectual property archives on internal systems for staging.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While the initial execution of the PoisonIvy backdoor fits this category, the question is about the preparation of intellectual property archives, which is not directly related to running code.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. Preparing intellectual property archives for staging is a form of data collection.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems. While the attackers did move laterally, the question is about the preparation of data, not the movement itself.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While the attackers may have used defense evasion techniques, the question is specifically about the preparation of data for exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers used the credentials obtained from the compromised systems to move laterally within the network.
- After gaining access to the systems hosting sensitive intellectual property, the next logical step is to collect and prepare the data for exfiltration.
- Preparing intellectual property archives on internal systems for staging is a clear example of the **Collection** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
