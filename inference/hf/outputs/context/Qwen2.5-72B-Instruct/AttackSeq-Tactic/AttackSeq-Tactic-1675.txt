### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers conducted thorough reconnaissance, understanding the victims' network infrastructure and using spear-phishing via email or social media.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers created fake websites and generated Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was attempted through malicious websites and spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes in two steps: decoding a PE file and executing it as a scheduled task.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses password-protected macros and string obfuscation to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The malware retrieves the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses HTTP and DNS for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Impact:** The DNS redirection could intercept traffic and harvest credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that ensures the malware remains active by running the binary every minute after the execution and scheduled task setup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, such as creating fake websites. It does not ensure the malware remains active.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware, which has already been done in the described sequence.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves communication with the C2 server, which is important but does not ensure the malware remains active.
   - **Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system over time, such as creating scheduled tasks to run the malware regularly.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report mentions that the malware executes a PE file and sets up a scheduled task to run the file when the document is closed.
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring the malware remains active by running the binary every minute.
   - Setting up a scheduled task to run the malware every minute is a classic example of the **Persistence** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Persistence
