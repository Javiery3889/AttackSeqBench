### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- It runs in the background immediately after installation.
- It can restart automatically on iOS 7 but not on iOS 8.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "After collecting information from the iOS device, such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to send the data out via HTTP and receive commands from the attacker?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance (A):**
- Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future attacks.
- This does not fit the context of sending collected data out or receiving commands.

**Command and Control (B):**
- Command and Control involves communicating with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data.
- This fits the context of sending data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker.

**Resource Development (C):**
- Resource Development involves establishing and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to support operations.
- This does not fit the context of sending collected data out or receiving commands.

**Discovery (D):**
- Discovery involves gathering information about the target system.
- This has already been covered in the report (collecting text messages, contact lists, etc.), but it does not fit the context of sending data out or receiving commands.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report describes the malware collecting various types of information from the iOS device.
- After collecting this information, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data and receive commands from the attacker.
- The ATT&CK tactic that best fits this scenario is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
