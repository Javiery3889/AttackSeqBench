### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** The execution of malicious code on the compromised system.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense and detection mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for further access and lateral movement.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishing communication channels to control the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the adversary explored the target network to locate relevant systems using the **Discovery** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery** is the phase where the attacker explores the network to find relevant systems, users, and data.
   - After discovering the relevant systems, the next logical step is to move laterally within the network to access these systems.
   - **Credential Access** is often used to gain the necessary credentials for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement** is the tactic that involves moving from one system to another within the network.
   - **Execution** is typically used to run malicious code, which is a prerequisite for many other tactics but not necessarily the immediate next step after discovery.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** While obtaining credentials is crucial for lateral movement, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after discovery. It can be a parallel or subsequent step.
   - **B: Discovery:** This is the current phase, not the next one.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This is the most logical next step after discovery, as the attacker would want to move to the identified systems.
   - **D: Execution:** Execution is a prerequisite for many tactics but is not the immediate next step after discovery.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
