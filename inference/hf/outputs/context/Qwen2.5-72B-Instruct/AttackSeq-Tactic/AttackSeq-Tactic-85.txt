### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Execution**: Agrius deployed custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', which was used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware. This backdoor was registered as a service for persistence and could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on commands from C2 servers.
- **Persistence**: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering its custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service on compromised systems.
- **Defense Evasion**: Agrius used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, some of which were obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function unique to the group. The backdoor 'IPsec Helper' contained functionality to update its engine and delete traces of itself to evade defenses.
- **Lateral Movement**: Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement within the target network. The group utilized a variety of publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, based on a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses. The malware awaited commands from these relays, which included updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.
- **Impact**: Agrius deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, to destroy data on targeted systems. Initially, 'Apostle' was a wiper that failed to execute properly due to a logic flaw but was later turned into functioning ransomware. DEADWOOD was used to overwrite files with random data and could be executed in service or Windows application mode, with various functionalities to prevent user access and ensure proper execution.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "After exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells to gain a foothold, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Agrius deployed custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target network, which is described in the report as exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code, which is described in the report as deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper'.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it, which is described in the report as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicating with C2 servers.

Given the sequence of events:
1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells.
2. **Execution**: Deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper'.

The question asks what happened before deploying custom malware for command execution. The most logical step before deploying the custom malware is the initial access to the system.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access** is the first step where the threat actor gains a foothold in the target network by exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells.
- **Execution** follows, where the custom malware 'IPsec Helper' is deployed to execute commands and establish further control.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Initial Access** occurred before the deployment of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper'.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
