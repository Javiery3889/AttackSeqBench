### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Execution**: The malware payload (Rdws.exe) deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique. It used the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll), which then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
- **Defense Evasion**: The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable. The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.
- **Command and Control**: The malware connected back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org and the subdomain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org for command and control. The domain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org resolved to an IP address in Seoul, South Korea, at the time of analysis.
- **Others**: The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit. The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information. ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

- **Question**: Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Exfiltration
  - B: Collection
  - C: Initial Access
  - D: Execution

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Execution**: The report clearly states that the malware payload (Rdws.exe) was deployed via a DLL sideloading technique. This is part of the **Execution** tactic.
- **Defense Evasion**: The sideloading technique is used to evade defenses, which is part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
- **Command and Control**: The malware connected back to the command and control servers, which is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.
- **Initial Access**: The report mentions that the attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load a malicious URL containing the Flash exploit. This indicates that the attackers gained initial access to the system through a web-based exploit, which is part of the **Initial Access** tactic.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reasoning**:
  - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that the attackers first gained **Initial Access** by compromising the PCA webpages and loading a malicious URL.
  - After gaining initial access, they deployed the dropper executable (Rdws.exe) via DLL sideloading, which is part of the **Execution** tactic.
  - The **Defense Evasion** and **Command and Control** tactics followed the initial execution of the malware.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The most likely tactic that occurred before the deployment of the dropper executable via DLL sideloading is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
