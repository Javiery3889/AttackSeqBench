### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report describes the initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon, which can be installed and executed in various forms and communicates with the C&C server using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** After gaining initial access, attackers use Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to steal account information, requiring higher privileges. They achieve this through UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Cobalt Strike provides techniques to bypass detection by security products, including packet manipulation and process manipulation.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Attackers use tools like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh for lateral movement to propagate beacons to other systems within the network.
   - **Others:** The report provides context about various cases and ransomware attacks involving Cobalt Strike.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurs after bypassing security product detection and escalating privileges, specifically when attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold, which has already been described in the report.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This tactic is about gaining higher privileges, which has also been described.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic is about bypassing security products, which is mentioned in the report.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems, which is described in the report.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and Active Directory, which aligns with the use of tools like ADFind and port scanning.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Bypassing security product detection (Defense Evasion).
     2. Escalating privileges (Privilege Escalation).
     3. Using tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather information (Discovery).

   - The use of ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information is a clear indication of the **Discovery** tactic. This is because the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is specifically about gathering information about the network and systems to aid in further attacks.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Discovery
