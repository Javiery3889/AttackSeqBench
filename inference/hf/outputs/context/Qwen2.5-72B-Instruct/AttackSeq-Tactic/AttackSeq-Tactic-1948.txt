### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers compromised a server belonging to ESTsoft.
- They modified the server to distribute a trojaned update file to SK Communications computers.
- The trojaned update file contained the malware 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza'.

**Execution:**
- The malware 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' executed on the infected SK Communications computers.
- It established a backdoor and communicated with a command and control server at 116.127.121.41 on TCP port 8080.
- Additional malware 'nateon.exe' was installed to access user databases.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used a legitimate software update process to deliver the trojaned update.
- This exploitation of trust went undetected for some time.

**Exfiltration:**
- The attackers exfiltrated personal details of up to 35 million SK Communications customers.
- The data was sent to a waypoint in Seoul's Nonhyeon neighborhood.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in using the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41 to monitor and control infected computers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. The report does not mention lateral movement.
- **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. The report does not focus on discovery activities.
- **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. The report mentions that the malware communicated with a command and control server at 116.127.121.41.
- **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data. The report mentions exfiltration, but it is not related to the domain 'update.alyac.org'.

**Reasoning:**
- The domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to 116.127.121.41 is used to communicate with and control the infected computers.
- This aligns with the **Command and Control** (C2) tactic, as it involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
