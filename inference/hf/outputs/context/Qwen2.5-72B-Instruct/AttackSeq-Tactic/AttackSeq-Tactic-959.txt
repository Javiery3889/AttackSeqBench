### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access (T1193):** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel document.
   - **Execution (T1204):** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1107, T1158, T1045):** The attack used file deletion, hidden files and directories, and software packing to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access (T1003, T1081, T1214):** The malware searched for and collected stored credentials from the registry and files.
   - **Collection (T1005):** The malware collected data from the local system.
   - **Command and Control (T1043, T1071):** The stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols and common ports.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the stolen credentials were sent to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Defense Evasion
     4. Credential Access
     5. Collection
     6. Command and Control
   - The question specifies that the stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - After the credentials are sent to the C2 server, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the collected data from the local system.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack and does not follow the C2 communication.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This is the most logical next step after sending credentials to the C2 server, as the attacker would want to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This is the step that is currently being described, not the next step.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This step has already occurred and is not the next logical step after C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
