### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain) to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold but does not provide specific techniques.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access but does not detail specific techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used techniques like T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network but does not detail specific techniques.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used techniques like T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1568 Dynamic Resolution.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the initial access through a compromised software update in the supply chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access through a compromised software update (T1195.002).
   - **Next Steps:**
     - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While it is a common next step, the report does not explicitly mention it.
     - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The report mentions that the attackers used techniques like T1071 and T1568 for command and control.
     - **Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the target system. The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold but does not provide specific techniques.
     - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves removing data from the target network. The report suggests that the attackers were focused on stealing data, but this is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to establish and maintain control over the compromised systems to execute their further operations.
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of command and control techniques (T1071 and T1568) to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - While persistence and exfiltration are also important, they typically occur after the attackers have established command and control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
