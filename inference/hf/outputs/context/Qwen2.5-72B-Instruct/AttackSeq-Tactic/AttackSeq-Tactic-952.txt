### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The threat actors use spear-phishing emails and strategic Web compromises to deliver Poison Ivy.
- **Execution**: The Poison Ivy server is delivered and executed on the target's endpoint.
- **Persistence**: A watchdog thread is injected into explorer.exe to ensure the Poison Ivy server process is restarted if terminated.
- **Defense Evasion**: Network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blend in with normal SSL traffic on port 443.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the network communications were encrypted and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is the initial step and occurs before the encryption of network communications.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running the Poison Ivy server on the target's endpoint, which happens before the encryption of network communications.
- **Persistence**: This tactic ensures the Poison Ivy server process is restarted if terminated, which can occur before or after the encryption of network communications.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves encrypting network communications to blend in with normal traffic, which is explicitly mentioned in the report.

Given that the question asks what happens **after** the network communications are encrypted and blended with normal SSL traffic, we need to consider the next logical step in the attack sequence.

- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand the environment, which can occur after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining communication with the compromised system, which is a natural next step after ensuring the network communications are encrypted and blended with normal traffic.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The encryption of network communications (Defense Evasion) is a crucial step to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
- After ensuring the communications are encrypted and blended with normal traffic, the next logical step is to establish and maintain command and control over the compromised system.
- Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
