### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
- Malicious Flash objects in PDF files exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Executable files are disguised as images or documents.

**Execution:**
- Uses the same loader as MiniDuke.
- Loader dates and updates are noted.

**Persistence:**
- Creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service'.
- Installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
- Copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.

**Credential Access:**
- Steals credentials from various software and Windows.
- Exports certificates and private keys using the password 'saribas'.

**Discovery:**
- Searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
- Targets non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.

**Command and Control:**
- Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
- Uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updates.

**Exfiltration:**
- Uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Lateral Movement
B: Discovery
C: Command and Control
D: Collection

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery:**
- The report states that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This is clearly a **Discovery** tactic.

**Next Step:**
- After discovering the files, the next logical step would be to collect the data. The report mentions that CosmicDuke collects information and exfiltrates it to remote servers.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Lateral Movement** - This involves moving to other systems within the network, which is not mentioned as the next step after file discovery.
- **B: Discovery** - This is the step that is already described in the report.
- **C: Command and Control** - This involves communication with remote servers, which is a separate step and not directly related to the collection of discovered files.
- **D: Collection** - This is the most logical next step after discovering the files, as the malware needs to gather the data before exfiltrating it.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives (Discovery).
2. After discovering the files, the next logical step is to collect the data (Collection).
3. The report mentions that the collected information is then exfiltrated to remote servers.

**Final Answer:**
D: Collection
