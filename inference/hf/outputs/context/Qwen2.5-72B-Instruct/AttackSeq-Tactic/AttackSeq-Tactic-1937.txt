### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The report mentions that Mustang Panda uses current events, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to lure victims with phishing documents. This indicates the use of social engineering and spear-phishing to deliver the initial malicious payload.
   - **Execution:** The campaign utilizes a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The campaign uses control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events, such as 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves gathering information and resources to support the attack, such as creating malicious documents. However, it does not directly involve the delivery of these documents to the target.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to the target system, such as spear-phishing with malicious documents. The use of filenames related to current events to lure victims is a classic example of Initial Access.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves the actual execution of the malware on the target system, which occurs after the initial access has been gained.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from the target system, which is not relevant to the delivery of the initial malicious document.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report mentions that Mustang Panda uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents. This is a clear indication of Initial Access.
   - The filenames used, such as 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe', are designed to trick users into opening the malicious documents, which is a common Initial Access technique.
   - The custom loader and execution of the Korplug variant occur after the initial access has been gained, which aligns with the Execution tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Initial Access
