### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
- Subsequent spear-phishing emails with MS Word or PowerPoint documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352.
- Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a malicious PowerPoint document.

**Execution:**
- Backdoor (UPX packed) downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
- Encoded blobs are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts and executed.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Use of encoded blobs to evade detection.

**Credential Access:**
- Steals user's Google Chrome credentials.

**Collection:**
- File-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.

**Command and Control:**
- Backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
- Resilient communications, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.

**Others:**
- Artifacts detected by Kaspersky Lab products.
- Collaboration with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and mitigate the threat.
- IoCs include backdoors, exploit documents, domains, IPs, and C2 redirectors.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Before Dropping Elephant gained initial access to high-profile targets through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as they targeted diplomatic and economic entities with a focus on gathering information?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Initial Access
B: Impact
C: Discovery
D: Reconnaissance

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- This tactic is about gaining access to the target network, which is described in the report through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

**Impact:**
- This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data, which is not mentioned in the report.

**Discovery:**
- This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to understand the environment they are operating in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after gaining initial access.

**Reconnaissance:**
- This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for future operations. The report mentions that Dropping Elephant targets diplomatic and economic entities with a focus on gathering information, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report describes the initial access methods (spear-phishing and watering hole attacks) and subsequent actions (execution, defense evasion, credential access, collection, and command and control).
- Before these initial access methods, the threat actor must have gathered information about the targets to tailor their attacks effectively.
- The focus on diplomatic and economic entities and the need to gather information aligns with the reconnaissance phase of the attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer:**
D: Reconnaissance
