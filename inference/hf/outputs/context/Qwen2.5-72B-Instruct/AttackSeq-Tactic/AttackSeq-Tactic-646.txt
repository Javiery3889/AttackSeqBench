### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The actors deliver Gh0st RAT via email, consistent with their documented tactics.
- Email is used as the delivery mechanism.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The actors use DLL side-loading as part of their evasion tactics.
- They embed a fully-functional version of the game Tetris within their malware, which launches under a special condition when attached to a debugger.

**Command and Control:**
- New command-and-control infrastructure has been discovered.
- A new domain, etybh[.]com, has been registered and is expected to be used in new intrusions.
- The domain shares the same IP and registrar with previously known C2 domains.

**Others:**
- ASERT has amended a previous blog post to remove an incorrect association with the APT group responsible for the Night Dragon campaign.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Initial Access
- B: Resource Development
- C: Execution
- D: Lateral Movement

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Delivering Gh0st RAT via email.
2. **Defense Evasion:** Using DLL side-loading to load a malicious DLL.

**Tactic Analysis:**
- **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the malware is delivered via email.
- **Defense Evasion:** This is the step where the malware uses techniques to avoid detection, such as DLL side-loading.

**Intermediary Tactic:**
- The question asks for the tactic that likely occurred between these two steps.
- **Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code on the victim's system, which is a logical step after the initial access and before the defense evasion techniques are employed.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step, not an intermediary step.
- **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, which typically occurs before initial access.
- **C: Execution:** This is the most logical step between initial access and defense evasion, as the malware needs to be executed to perform the side-loading.
- **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to spread the infection, which typically occurs after the initial infection and defense evasion.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after the initial access (delivering Gh0st RAT via email), the next logical step is to execute the malware on the victim's system.
- Once the malware is executed, it can then employ defense evasion techniques such as DLL side-loading.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access → Execution → Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
