### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various tools and commands to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to discover machines in the compromised network environment, Earth Lusca exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The question already mentions that reconnaissance has been completed using scanning tools.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While Earth Lusca used defense evasion techniques, the question specifically mentions exploiting remote services and internal spear phishing, which are more aligned with lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand access. Exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels are typical lateral movement techniques.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the network. The question already mentions that discovery has been completed using scanning tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that Earth Lusca used scanning tools to discover machines in the network, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - After discovering the network, the next logical step would be to move laterally to other machines to expand their access.
   - The question specifically mentions exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels, which are clear indicators of lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
