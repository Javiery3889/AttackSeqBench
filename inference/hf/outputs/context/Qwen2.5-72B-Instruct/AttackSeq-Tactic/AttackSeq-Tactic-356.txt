### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
- SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
- Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

**Execution:**
- Malicious code was executed through various methods.
- 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
- 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).

**Defense Evasion:**
- Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.
- Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

**Discovery:**
- SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
- Tools like pscan and nmap used for network service scanning.

**Command and Control:**
- SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
- C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
- RSA encryption for AES key exchange.
- Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.

**Exfiltration:**
- SombRAT backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign utilized process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery through the SombRAT backdoor and archived the gathered information using a custom storage file format.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's environment. The question is about actions taken after initial access and discovery, so this is not the correct answer.
- **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. The question mentions archiving the gathered information, which aligns with the collection of data.
- **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack. The question is about actions taken after the attack has already begun, so this is not the correct answer.
- **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The question mentions process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, which are part of the discovery phase. However, the question asks what happens after these discovery actions.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CostaRicto Campaign used the SombRAT backdoor to perform process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
- After discovering this information, the next logical step would be to collect and archive the gathered data.
- The question specifically mentions archiving the gathered information using a custom storage file format, which aligns with the Collection tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
