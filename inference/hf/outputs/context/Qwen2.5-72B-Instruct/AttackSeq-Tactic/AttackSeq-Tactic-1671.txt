### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Resource Development**: The attackers created fake websites with job postings and generated Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains.
- **Initial Access**: Initial access was attempted through malicious websites hosting job listings and spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
- **Execution**: The malware executes in two steps: decoding a PE file and executing it as a scheduled task.
- **Persistence**: The malware maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses password-protected macros and string obfuscation.
- **Discovery**: The malware retrieves the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.
- **Command and Control**: The malware uses HTTP and DNS for C2 communication.
- **Impact**: The DNS redirection could intercept traffic and harvest credentials.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involved understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets such as .gov domains and a private airline before gaining initial access through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Resource Development**: This involves creating resources like fake websites and certificates, but it does not directly involve understanding the network infrastructure or identifying valuable targets.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, including network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets. This aligns with the question's requirement.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher-level permissions within the network, which is not relevant to the initial understanding of the network infrastructure.
- **Impact**: This involves the consequences of the attack, such as intercepting traffic and harvesting credentials, which is not relevant to the initial understanding of the network infrastructure.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The question asks about the tactic that involves understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets before gaining initial access.
- The **Reconnaissance** tactic fits this description, as it involves gathering information about the target, including network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets.
- The other options (Resource Development, Privilege Escalation, and Impact) do not align with the requirement of understanding the network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets before initial access.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
