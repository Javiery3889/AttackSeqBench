### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 (CVE-2014-4114) via infected Excel documents.
- The attack vector involves a Visual Basic macro in the Excel document.

**Execution:**
- The macro reassembles and executes a PE32 file named vba_macro.exe.
- vba_macro.exe drops FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, then deletes itself.
- FONTCACHE.DAT operates as a network sniffer.
- rundll32.exe is used to load the malicious DLL.

**Persistence:**
- The malware registers a binary to the startup shell using RegSetValueExw() to ensure FONTCACHE.DAT is executed on startup.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt(), SetUnhandledExceptionFilter, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent.
- It also detects runtime checksum changes to evade non-hardware breakpoints.

**Discovery:**
- The malware gathers local network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP.
- The IP address 5.149.254.114 is associated with FORTUNIX-NETWORS.
- It sends localization data and keyboard layout information to the C2 server.

**Exfiltration:**
- The malware functions as a network sniffer and sends gathered information to the C2 server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the malware gathered local network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API and before it sent data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access:** This tactic is already completed by the time the malware gathers local network information.
- **Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the report as occurring between gathering network information and sending data to the C2 server.
- **Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with the C2 server, which is the next logical step after gathering network information.
- **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report as occurring between gathering network information and sending data to the C2 server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access** is the first step, where the malware gains entry through the infected Excel document.
2. **Execution** follows, where the malware is executed via the macro.
3. **Persistence** ensures the malware remains on the system.
4. **Defense Evasion** helps the malware avoid detection.
5. **Discovery** involves gathering local network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.
6. **Command and Control** is the next logical step, where the malware communicates with the C2 server to send the gathered information.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the malware gathers local network information and before it sends data to the C2 server is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
