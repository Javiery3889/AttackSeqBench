### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Emissary Panda identified systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells on SharePoint servers.
   - **Execution:** Uploaded tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors.
   - **Persistence:** Installed webshells for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used webshells for DLL sideloading and maintaining access.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumped credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Command and Control:** Used the HyperBro backdoor for C2.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Emissary Panda performed lateral movement by exploiting EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), after gaining credential access using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This occurred before initial access and is not relevant to the sequence after gaining credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial step and is not relevant to the sequence after gaining credentials.
   - **Execution:** This involves uploading tools and backdoors, which is a step before gaining credentials.
   - **Persistence:** This involves installing webshells for long-term access, which is a step before gaining credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This involves techniques to avoid detection, which can occur before or after gaining credentials.
   - **Credential Access:** This is the step where Mimikatz is used to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This is the step where the actors move laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** This involves maintaining communication with the C2 server, which can occur before or after gaining credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After gaining credential access using tools like Mimikatz, the next logical step before lateral movement would be to discover the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - The **Discovery** tactic involves gathering information about the network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts, which is essential for planning and executing lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Discovery
