### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Defense Evasion**: The attackers obfuscated their malicious code by appending it to the end of the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file and using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.
- **Others**: The threat actors used IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation, suggesting a targeted campaign. The primary network indicator is communication with the IP address 176.58.101.24.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Command and Control
  - B: Defense Evasion
  - C: Initial Access
  - D: Resource Development

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target environment. The report does not provide details about how the attackers initially gained access to the CDN server.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack. The report does not mention any resource development activities.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The report does not provide details about command and control activities.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The report explicitly mentions that the attackers obfuscated their malicious code by appending it to the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file and using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server.
2. They conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.
3. After modifying the file, they obfuscated the malicious code to avoid detection.

Given the sequence of events, the most logical next step after gaining access and modifying the file would be to obfuscate the code to avoid detection, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
