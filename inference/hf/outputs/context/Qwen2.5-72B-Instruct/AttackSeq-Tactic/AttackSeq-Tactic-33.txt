### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
- **Execution**: Upon opening the document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
- **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operated in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
- **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
- **Impact**: The payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware, which performed various malicious actions.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Defense Evasion
  - B: Reconnaissance
  - C: Lateral Movement
  - D: Initial Access

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The report clearly states that the initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros.
- **Reconnaissance**: Before an adversary can send phishing emails, they typically need to gather information about the target, such as email addresses, organizational structure, and potential vulnerabilities. This is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic is used after gaining initial access to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic is used after gaining initial access to move through the network to other systems.
- **Initial Access**: This is the tactic that describes the method used to gain access to the target systems, which in this case is through phishing emails.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access was achieved through phishing emails, which is a clear indication of the Initial Access tactic.
  - However, before the adversary could send these phishing emails, they would have needed to gather information about the target, which is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
  - The other options (Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement) occur after the initial access has been gained.
  - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the initial access is Reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
