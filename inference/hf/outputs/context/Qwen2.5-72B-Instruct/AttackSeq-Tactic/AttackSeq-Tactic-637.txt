### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular.
- Used for espionage and reconnaissance.
- Deployed a 'mini' backdoor before admin rights are obtained.
- C&C servers were active Tor relays for operational security.

**Initial Access:**
- Used spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
- Lateral movement from compromised internal web servers to other workstations.

**Persistence:**
- Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Stealth techniques: selective module deployment, partial encryption, fileless execution.

**Credential Access:**
- Use of tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Deploy internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to external C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**
- Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

**Others:**
- Linked to BlackEnergy and TeleBots.
- Focus on the energy sector and critical infrastructure.
- Victims primarily in Ukraine and Poland.
- Code reuse with NotPetya worm.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Before GreyEnergy achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers, which ATT&CK tactic most likely informed their strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Command and Control
B: Resource Development
C: Collection
D: Reconnaissance

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Resource Development:**
- Involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing or acquiring malware.
- Not directly related to strategic targeting of specific systems.

**Command and Control:**
- Involves communicating with compromised systems to control them.
- Occurs after initial access and is not related to the initial targeting.

**Collection:**
- Involves gathering data from the target system.
- Occurs after initial access and is not related to the initial targeting.

**Reconnaissance:**
- Involves gathering information about the target before the attack.
- Likely to inform the strategic targeting of specific systems, such as ICS control workstations running SCADA software.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks about the tactic that informed the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
- Before achieving initial access, the attackers would need to gather information about the target environment to identify and target specific systems.
- The ATT&CK tactic that best fits this description is **Reconnaissance**.
- Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target, which is crucial for identifying and targeting specific systems like ICS control workstations running SCADA software.

**Final Answer:**
D: Reconnaissance
