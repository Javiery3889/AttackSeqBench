### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Persistence**: APT33 used botnets to maintain persistence within the networks of select targets.
- **Defense Evasion**: APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their C&C servers, using cloud-hosted proxies and private VPN networks.
- **Discovery**: APT33 conducted reconnaissance on networks relevant to the oil industry's supply chain.
- **Command and Control**: APT33 operated C&C servers using private VPN networks to issue commands and collect data.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT33 targeted companies in the oil product supply chain using spear phishing campaigns to gain access, and before they secured persistence within the networks by using botnets.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining a foothold in the target network, which is typically done through methods like spear phishing. The report mentions that APT33 targeted companies using spear phishing campaigns to gain access.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, such as developing or acquiring malware. The report does not provide specific details about this phase.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which is mentioned in the report. APT33 conducted reconnaissance on networks relevant to the oil industry's supply chain.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network, which is described in the report as using botnets to maintain persistence.

Given the sequence of events:
1. APT33 targeted companies using spear phishing campaigns to gain initial access.
2. They conducted reconnaissance (Discovery) to understand the network.
3. They secured persistence using botnets.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access** (spear phishing) is the first step.
- **Discovery** (reconnaissance) is the next logical step after gaining initial access.
- **Persistence** (using botnets) is the final step in the sequence provided.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Initial Access
2. Discovery
3. Persistence

The tactic that most likely occurred after gaining initial access and before securing persistence is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
