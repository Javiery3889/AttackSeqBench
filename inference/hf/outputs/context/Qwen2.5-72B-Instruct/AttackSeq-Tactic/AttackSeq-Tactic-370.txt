### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The London Blue group collected contact information for more than 500 financial executives, including Agari CFO Raymond Lim, using a commercial US-based lead service.
- This information was gathered as part of the initial preparation for BEC campaigns targeting California-based companies.

**Defense Evasion:**
- London Blue's BEC attempt against Agari CFO Raymond Lim was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.

**Others:**
- London Blue has evolved their tactics by targeting new parts of the world, including Asia, and using new tactics in their BEC campaigns.
- They have also started spoofing email addresses of target company CEOs to add authenticity to their attacks.
- The group has amassed a new targeting database of nearly 8,500 financial executives from almost 7,800 different companies worldwide.
- Most companies targeted using spoofing techniques do not have a DMARC record established, and those that do often have policies set to p=none, which does not prevent spoofed emails from reaching their targets.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before London Blue sent a test email from an attack email account to verify successful delivery as part of their BEC campaign?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Command and Control
- B: Resource Development
- C: Initial Access
- D: Defense Evasion

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance:**
- The group collected contact information for financial executives, which is a crucial step in preparing for a BEC campaign. This is the initial phase where they gather the necessary information to target specific individuals.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The BEC attempt was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection, indicating that the group tried to evade detection and defenses.

**Resource Development:**
- This tactic involves establishing the infrastructure and resources needed to support the attack, such as creating or acquiring email accounts, domains, and tools. Sending a test email to verify successful delivery is a part of ensuring that the infrastructure is working correctly.

**Initial Access:**
- This tactic involves the initial compromise of the target, such as sending a phishing email or exploiting a vulnerability. However, before sending the actual BEC email, the group needs to ensure that their infrastructure is set up correctly.

**Command and Control:**
- This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is not relevant to the initial setup and testing phase of the BEC campaign.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reconnaissance** is the first step where the group gathers the necessary information about the targets.
- **Resource Development** is the next logical step where the group sets up the infrastructure, including creating or acquiring email accounts and domains.
- **Initial Access** would follow after the infrastructure is set up, but the question specifically asks about the step before sending a test email to verify successful delivery.
- **Defense Evasion** is a tactic used during the attack to avoid detection, which is not the focus of the question.

Given the sequence of events and the need to ensure that the infrastructure is working correctly before the actual attack, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: Resource Development**
