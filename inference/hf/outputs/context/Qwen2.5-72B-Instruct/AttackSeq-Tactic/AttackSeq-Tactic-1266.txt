### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 performed reconnaissance to identify the target.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used various techniques for privilege escalation, including custom tools and code injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used publicly available tools to perform reconnaissance and map targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders and used web shells to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established command and control using an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers and before they executed sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deserialization Attacks:** These are typically used to gain initial access to a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application.
   - **Execution:** This is the next logical step after gaining initial access, where the threat actor runs the malware on the target system.
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack chain, where the threat actor gains entry into the target system.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This typically occurs after the threat actor has gained access and is looking to gain higher privileges.
   - **Persistence:** This is often established after the threat actor has gained access and executed their initial payload.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that the threat actor first gained initial access using deserialization attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malware on the target system.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the deserialization attacks and before the execution of the memory-resident malware is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Initial Access
