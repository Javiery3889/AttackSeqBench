### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** The attackers used weaponized RTF files and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** A scheduled task named 'Windows Update' was created to run a DLL function daily.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques were employed, and the loader used dynamic API resolving.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor collected a wide range of data from the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using encrypted messages.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel.
   - **Impact:** The backdoor could shut down the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents utilizing the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system, which is typically done through methods like spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system, which is the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems, which is not mentioned in the CTI report as an immediate next step.
   - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending data out of the victim's network, which is a later step in the attack sequence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the initial access was achieved through weaponized RTF files, which are similar to the DOCX documents mentioned in the question.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malicious code to establish a foothold on the system.
   - The report mentions that the RTF files initiated a multi-stage infection chain, leading to the execution of malicious code.
