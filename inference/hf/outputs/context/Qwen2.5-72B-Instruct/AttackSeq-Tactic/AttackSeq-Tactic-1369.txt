### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware (SIXPACK, SWEARJAR), and email communications (MAILSLOT) for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FIN13 uses passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 gains initial access by exploiting external servers and deploying web shells and custom malware.
   - **Persistence:** After gaining initial access, FIN13 would likely want to ensure they can maintain access to the network. This involves setting up persistence mechanisms.
   - **Execution:** While execution is a critical step, it is typically part of the initial access phase or immediately following it to run the deployed malware.
   - **Discovery:** Discovery is a subsequent step where the attacker explores the network to understand its structure and identify valuable targets.
   - **Credential Access:** Credential access is also a subsequent step, often following discovery, to gather credentials for further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 gains access by deploying web shells and custom malware.
   - **Persistence:** The next logical step is to ensure they can maintain access. This is crucial for long-term operations, which align with FIN13's known behavior of long dwell times.
   - **Execution:** While execution is necessary, it is typically part of the initial access phase or immediately following it.
   - **Discovery:** Discovery is a later step, typically after ensuring persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** Credential access is also a later step, often following discovery.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Persistence
