### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets specific industries and maps victim networks.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT and passive backdoors (BLUEAGAVE) are used for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT are used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are used for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, custom droppers (LATCHKEY), and malware (DRAWSTRING) are used for defense evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS process memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass are used for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR are used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from network shared drives and staged for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols are used for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - The techniques mentioned are process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting, which fall under the **Credential Access** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access** is already part of the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **Command and Control** involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which typically occurs after gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - **Reconnaissance** involves gathering information before the attack, which is not relevant to the sequence after credential access.
   - **Discovery** involves gathering information about the network and host configurations, which is a logical next step after gaining credentials to understand the environment better.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access** (LSASS process memory dumping and targeting unsecured credentials) is a prerequisite for gaining the necessary credentials.
   - After gaining credentials, the next logical step is to **Discovery** the network and host configurations to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Discovery** is a critical step before using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather more detailed information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
