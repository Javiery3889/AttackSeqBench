### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, delivered through an email attachment. The zip file contains a decoy Word document icon, which is actually an application bundle with executable code.
   - **Execution:** When the user opens the decoy document, the Trojan executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution. It opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs at startup, copies itself to a location based on the user's UID, and launches itself as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor avoids suspicious strings and uses a robust string encoding mechanism and custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor gathers victim information (name, machine serial number, system information) and sends it to the command and control server.
   - **Others:** Additional context about the threat actor and its targets.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next after the backdoor surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the backdoor gathering information about the victim's system, which has already been described in the report.
   - **Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, which is not mentioned in the report.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the backdoor communicating with a remote server to receive commands or exfiltrate data. The report mentions that the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with the command and control server.
   - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the backdoor sending data from the victim's system to a remote server. While the report mentions sending information, it does not explicitly state that this is the next step after the initial communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor has already gathered and sent information to the command and control server (Discovery).
   - The next logical step is for the backdoor to establish and maintain communication with the command and control server to receive further commands or exfiltrate data.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a clear indication of Command and Control activity.
