### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The Darkhotel APT compromises trusted commercial network resources and maintains a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** The APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates and seeding P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** The APT deploys various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and uses 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** The APT maintains persistence through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The APT uses digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypts gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:** The APT's information stealer module targets stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** The APT's keylogger and information stealer modules collect and encrypt data.
   - **Command and Control:** The APT maintains a web interface for victim management and encrypts victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay, before the initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack. It does not directly involve gathering information about specific victims.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is the most likely candidate for obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the actual method of gaining access to the target's systems, which in this case is through malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised systems, which occurs after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT targets hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates. This implies that the APT must have known which guests were staying at the hotel and when.
   - To know this information, the APT must have conducted reconnaissance to gather details about the victims' travel plans and other relevant information.
   - The other tactics (Resource Development, Initial Access, and Command and Control) do not fit the requirement of obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
