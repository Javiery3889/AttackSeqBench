### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Impact**: The report describes a series of DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, specifically targeting Next Media's Apple Daily publication and causing a total network failure.
- **Others**: The DDoS attacks are linked to APT activity, including Operation Poisoned Hurricane. The use of digital certificates and shared tools suggests a connection to APT actors, indicating potential state-sponsored activity.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After decoding configuration files to issue new instructions for targeted DDoS attacks, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Discovery
  - B: Reconnaissance
  - C: Impact
  - D: Command and Control

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Decoding Configuration Files**: This suggests that the attackers are dynamically updating the DDoS attack instructions, which implies a level of control over the botnet.
- **Receiving Targeting Instructions**: The KernelBot implants need to receive and execute these new instructions.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance (B)**: Before launching a DDoS attack, the attackers need to gather information about the target, such as IP addresses, network topology, and potential vulnerabilities. This is a crucial step to ensure the attack is effective.
2. **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the attackers exploring the network to understand its structure and identify potential targets. However, this is more relevant to the initial stages of an intrusion rather than the DDoS attack itself.
3. **Impact (C)**: This is the final stage where the DDoS attack is executed, causing the disruption described in the report.
4. **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the attackers maintaining control over the botnet and issuing commands to the implants. Given that the configuration files are being decoded to issue new instructions, this is a critical step before the actual DDoS attack is launched.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI report and the question is that the **Command and Control** tactic occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
