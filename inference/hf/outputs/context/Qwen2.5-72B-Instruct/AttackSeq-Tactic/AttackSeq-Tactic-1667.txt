### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Regin uses various methods to gain initial access, including tricking targets into visiting spoofed websites, exploiting web browsers, and using Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin's execution involves a multi-staged architecture with six stages, each with specific roles in loading and running the threat.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide explicit details, but the multi-staged architecture and use of kernel drivers suggest long-term persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself, including encrypted data storage and non-traditional file storage areas.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic, including using modules to steal Windows Explorer credentials and IIS network traffic.
   - **Collection:** Regin has extensive collection capabilities, including capturing screenshots, controlling the mouse, gathering computer information, and sniffing network traffic.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin's C&C operations are extensive and bidirectional, using various encrypted transport protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after using credential-stealing modules to collect administration data, specifically to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that Regin uses modules to steal passwords and monitor network traffic, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is a broad category that includes various data collection activities.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to understand the system and network environment, which includes locating processes and memory utilization.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future operations, which is typically done before the initial access.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to the system, which is the first step in the attack chain.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that after stealing credentials and monitoring network traffic, the next step is to locate processes and memory utilization. This activity is most closely aligned with the **Discovery** tactic.
   - **Discovery** involves the adversary trying to understand the system and network environment, which includes identifying running processes and memory usage.
   - **Collection** is a broader category that includes gathering data, but it does not specifically focus on understanding the system's processes and memory.
   - **Reconnaissance** and **Initial Access** are earlier stages in the attack chain and do not fit the context of the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
