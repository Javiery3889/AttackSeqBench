### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Whitefly sends spear-phishing emails with a dropper.
   - **Execution:** The dropper executes a loader (Trojan.Vcrodat) which uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs and establishes communication with a C&C domain.
   - **Persistence:** Whitefly deploys tools like a simple remote shell and Termite to maintain long-term access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Whitefly exploits CVE-2016-0051 and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Whitefly uses search order hijacking and custom malware to remain undetected.
   - **Credential Access:** Whitefly uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Whitefly maps the network and infects further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using stolen credentials, Whitefly compromises additional machines.
   - **Collection:** Whitefly steals large volumes of sensitive information.
   - **Exfiltration:** Whitefly exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after network mapping and infecting further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities, but before exfiltrating large volumes of information over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves network mapping and infecting further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves using stolen credentials to compromise additional machines on the network.
   - **Collection:** This tactic involves stealing large volumes of sensitive information.
   - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves exfiltrating large volumes of information over time.

   Based on the sequence described in the CTI report:
   - **Discovery** (network mapping and infecting further computers) occurs first.
   - **Lateral Movement** (compromising additional machines) follows.
   - **Collection** (stealing sensitive information) occurs next.
   - **Exfiltration** (exfiltrating information) is the final step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after network mapping and infecting further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities, but before exfiltrating large volumes of information over time, is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
