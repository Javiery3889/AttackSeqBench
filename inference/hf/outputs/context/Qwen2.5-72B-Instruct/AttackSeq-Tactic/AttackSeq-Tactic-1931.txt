### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
- **Execution**: Downloader installs backdoor components, runs as a self-extracting file, and executes the malware.
- **Persistence**: Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files and directories.
- **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading.
- **Credential Access**: Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
- **Discovery**: Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, process enumeration.
- **Collection**: Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, encrypting data.
- **Command and Control**: Using FTP and HTTP for communication, implementing fallback channels.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely followed after Machete used standard FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication and implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control**: The report states that Machete used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication and implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration.
- **Exfiltration**: The next logical step after establishing C&C and implementing fallback channels would be to exfiltrate the collected data. The report mentions that Machete collected data and staged it in a temporary folder, which would then be exfiltrated using the established C&C channels.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Machete establishes C&C communication using FTP and HTTP.
- **Step 2**: It implements fallback channels for document exfiltration.
- **Step 3**: The next logical step is to exfiltrate the collected data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
