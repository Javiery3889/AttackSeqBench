### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Taidoor attackers used vulnerabilities in Microsoft Common Controls, Adobe Reader, Acrobat, Flash Player, Microsoft Excel, and PowerPoint. They exploited these vulnerabilities using malicious .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, and .PPT files.
   - **Execution:** Upon opening a malicious document, the Taidoor malware creates files, executes a small executable, modifies the Windows Registry, and maintains persistence.
   - **Persistence:** The malware uses a file to modify the Windows Registry key to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware produces identifiable network traffic and uses obfuscation and encryption for communication.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C&C servers using HTTP and RC4 encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware can upload files to the C&C server.
   - **Impact:** The malware has RAT functionalities, leading to data theft, data destruction, and potential DoS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the tactic where the attackers gain access to the system, which is described in the report as using vulnerabilities and malicious documents.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. It can occur after initial access but is not a prerequisite for gaining initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is a preparatory step that occurs before initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the attackers used vulnerabilities and malicious documents to gain initial access.
   - Before exploiting these vulnerabilities, the attackers would need to gather information about the target, such as the software versions and potential vulnerabilities.
   - The reconnaissance phase is crucial for identifying the specific vulnerabilities and crafting the malicious documents.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first performed reconnaissance to gather the necessary information, which they then used to gain initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
