### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Initial Access**: APT15 gained initial access by stealing a VPN certificate.
- **Execution**: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
  - **RoyalCLI**: Bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.
  - **RoyalDNS**: Installs persistently and communicates over DNS.
- **Persistence**: RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently.
- **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
- **Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
- **Collection**: APT15 used tools like CSVDE, BCP, and bespoke tools to extract information from various sources.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "After APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz for privilege escalation, which ATT&CK tactic most likely followed enabling their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
- **RoyalCLI**: Bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

The key point here is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 needed to bypass policy settings to enable the RoyalCLI backdoor. This action is aimed at evading the security measures in place to prevent command prompt execution.

- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Bypassing policy settings to enable command prompt execution fits this category.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This has already been completed by gaining domain administrator credentials.
- **Discovery**: This involves techniques to gather information about the system and network.
- **Collection**: This involves techniques to gather data of interest from the target.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
2. **Defense Evasion**: APT15 then needed to bypass policy settings to enable the RoyalCLI backdoor, which is a form of defense evasion.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 used defense evasion techniques to bypass policy settings and enable the RoyalCLI backdoor.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
