### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** The worm executed malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, to perform various tasks.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers and modified system files to ensure it ran at startup.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stuxnet used MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Stuxnet used rootkit functionality, stole digital certificates, and patched system libraries to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers using HTTP and implemented an RPC server for peer-to-peer communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates for evasion, specifically while exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis, which Stuxnet used by employing rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which Stuxnet did, but the question is about spreading across networked systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand the attacker's control. Exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems is a clear example of lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with and control the infected systems, which Stuxnet did, but the question is about spreading across networked systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates for evasion, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - The next part of the question asks about the tactic that occurred while exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - Exploiting these vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems is a clear example of **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
