### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 (CVE-2014-4114) through infected Excel documents.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed via a Visual Basic macro, which reassembles and runs a PE32 executable (vba_macro.exe). This executable drops FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe.
   - **Persistence:** The malware registers a binary to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function to ensure FONTCACHE.DAT runs at startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt(), SetUnhandledExceptionFilter, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() API.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The malware is designed to move laterally and sends data to servers in major ISPs across Europe.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware functions as a network sniffer and sends gathered information to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that describes the malware communicating with its C2 server using the HTTP protocol after gathering network information for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. While the malware does exfiltrate data, the question specifically asks about communication with the C2 server, which is more about command and control.
   - **Impact (B):** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of communicating with a C2 server.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by the malware to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. This fits the context of the malware communicating with its C2 server using the HTTP protocol.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves the techniques used to move through a network to expand access. While the malware does perform lateral movement, the specific action of communicating with the C2 server is more aligned with command and control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
