### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers sent crafted emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The recipients executed the malicious attachments, which installed the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.
   - **Command and Control:** The PoisonIvy Trojan communicated with a C&C server over TCP port 80.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes.
   - **Collection:** The attackers copied the desired intellectual property to internal staging servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected data was uploaded to a remote site outside the organization.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers dumped Windows cached password hashes and used these credentials to traverse the network and search for servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which the attackers did by dumping Windows cached password hashes.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to access additional systems, which the attackers did using the dumped credentials.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network, which the attackers did to find servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.
   - **Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data, which the attackers did by copying the intellectual property to internal staging servers.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report indicates that after obtaining the credentials (Credential Access), the attackers used these credentials to move through the network (Lateral Movement) to find and access servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.
   - The next logical step after Lateral Movement would be Discovery, but the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred immediately after using the credentials to traverse the network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers used the credentials to move laterally through the network.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
