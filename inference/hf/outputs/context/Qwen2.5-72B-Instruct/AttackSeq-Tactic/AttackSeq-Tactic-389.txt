### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- The threat actors acquired domain names and rented servers.
- They compromised high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code that would load additional malicious code from their C&C servers.

**Initial Access:**
- Visitors to the compromised websites were exposed to exploits after their browsers were fingerprinted.
- The threat actors engaged in spearphishing campaigns, sending emails with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.

**Execution:**
- The malicious Word documents contained VBA macros that executed code using the Document_Open function.

**Others:**
- The campaign targeted high-profile organizations in the Middle East, with a focus on Yemen.
- The attackers likely purchased Candiru implants and exploits.
- The campaign involved strategic web compromises.
- The campaign went quiet after July 2021.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred when the scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Execution
- B: Impact
- C: Command and Control
- D: Initial Access

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Resource Development:** Acquiring domain names and servers.
2. **Initial Access:** Compromising websites and sending spearphishing emails.
3. **Execution:** Executing VBA macros in malicious Word documents.
4. **Command and Control:** Scripts from compromised websites communicating with external servers.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Execution:** This is the step where the VBA macros are executed, not the communication with external servers.
- **B: Impact:** This involves the consequences of the attack, such as data theft or system disruption, not the communication with external servers.
- **C: Command and Control:** This is the step where the malware communicates with the attacker's servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
- **D: Initial Access:** This is the initial step where the threat actors gain entry into the target system, not the communication with external servers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The VBA macros in the malicious Word documents are executed, which is the **Execution** phase.
- After execution, the scripts from the compromised websites (watering hole attacks) begin communicating with external servers. This communication is a key part of the **Command and Control** phase, where the malware establishes a channel to receive commands or send data back to the attacker.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
