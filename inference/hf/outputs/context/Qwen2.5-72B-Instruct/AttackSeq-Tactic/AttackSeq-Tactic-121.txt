### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious email containing trojaned Microsoft Word documents.
   - **Execution:** The 'Surtr' malware creates a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process using the `CreateRemoteThread` function.
   - **Persistence:** 'Surtr' adds a key to the registry to ensure it runs on restart and stores C2 information and a campaign code in the registry.
   - **Discovery:** 'Surtr' lists file directories and contents, views web cache, executes remote commands, and logs keystrokes.
   - **Command and Control:** 'Surtr' connects to a C2 server and downloads a stage two component.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the execution of the 'Surtr' malware through the creation of a new process with the `CreateRemoteThread` function and before the malware listed file directories on the victim computer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The malware has already executed by creating a new process and injecting itself.
   - **Persistence:** The malware adds a registry key to ensure it runs on restart and stores C2 information.
   - **Discovery:** The malware lists file directories and contents, which is the next step after persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Malicious email with trojaned attachments.
     2. **Execution:** Malware creates a new process and injects itself.
     3. **Persistence:** Malware adds registry keys for persistence.
     4. **Discovery:** Malware lists file directories and contents.
   - The question asks what happens between the execution (creation of a new process and injection) and the discovery (listing file directories).
   - The only tactic that fits between these two steps is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Persistence
