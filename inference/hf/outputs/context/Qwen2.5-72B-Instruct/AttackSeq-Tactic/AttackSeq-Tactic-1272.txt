### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and in-memory malware, and removed disk-resident tools for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders and moved laterally using compromised credentials and web shells.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (A):** This involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is necessary but not directly related to scanning and mapping targets.
   - **Discovery (B):** This involves gathering information about the network, which aligns with the use of tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping.
   - **Execution (C):** This involves running malicious code, which is a prerequisite but not directly related to scanning and mapping.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This involves obtaining credentials, which is useful but not directly related to scanning and mapping.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gains access to the network.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executes memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 maintains access using web shells and in-memory malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 gains higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 avoids detection.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 steals credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 uses tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit to scan and map the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 moves laterally using the stolen credentials and web shells.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 establishes C2.

   The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets is a clear indication of the **Discovery** phase. This phase typically occurs after gaining initial access, executing malware, and possibly after privilege escalation and credential access, but before lateral movement and command and control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
