### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Logged into a public-facing system via SSH using a local account.
- Used port forwarding to establish RDP sessions to internal servers.
- Used VPNs to gain access and persist in the environment.
- Exported saved passwords from Chrome browser installations.

**Persistence:**
- Used credential hopping.
- Leveraged accounts with Delegated Administrator rights.
- Configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
- Configured GoldMax malware for persistence via crontab.
- Added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new ones.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.
- Renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
- Renamed systems to match the victim's naming convention.

**Discovery:**
- Used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information.
- Regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe.
- Probed external services to regain access.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

**Collection:**
- Accessed data from Information Repositories.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks: "Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the StellarParticle campaign used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access?"

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The use of AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information is part of the Discovery phase, not Reconnaissance.
- **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the network. The use of AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information is not part of Initial Access.
- **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target network. The use of AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information is a clear example of the Discovery phase.
- **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While the threat actor did use credentials, the specific action of gathering Active Directory information is more aligned with Discovery.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly states that the threat actor used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information.
- This activity is part of the Discovery phase, where the threat actor is identifying systems and information within the network.
- The other answer choices (Reconnaissance, Initial Access, and Credential Access) do not align as closely with the described activity.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
