### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Defense Evasion:**
- Longhorn's tools use practices such as wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting.

**Discovery:**
- Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. It uses operational security measures to remain undetected.

**Collection:**
- Longhorn's malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules. It is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.

**Exfiltration:**
- Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn's tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, as well as targets in various sectors. Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets in 16 countries. The group uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses. Longhorn operates with a high degree of operational security and appears to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, with indicators suggesting it is from an English-speaking, North American country.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Longhorn employed practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Exfiltration
B: Defense Evasion
C: Discovery
D: Initial Access

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report states that Longhorn's tools use practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting. These are techniques used to avoid detection and are part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Discovery:**
- Discovery involves gathering information from the target system, such as system fingerprinting and discovery of network resources. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and before exfiltration.

**Exfiltration:**
- Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker's system. This typically occurs after the data has been collected and the attacker has established a presence on the system.

**Initial Access:**
- Initial Access involves the methods used to gain entry into the target system. This is the first step in the attack chain and occurs before any other tactics.

**Reasoning:**
- The practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols are part of the Defense Evasion tactic. These techniques are used to avoid detection and are typically employed after the attacker has gained access to the system and is preparing to maintain their presence or exfiltrate data.
- The Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the system, would logically occur before the attacker needs to employ defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.
- Exfiltration and Initial Access are less likely to be the correct answers because Exfiltration occurs after data collection and Initial Access is the first step in the attack chain.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
