### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Patchwork used spear phishing campaigns with unique tracking links to identify which recipients opened the emails.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The threat actors used spear phishing emails with malicious RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 to drop and execute QuasarRAT.
   - **Execution:**
     - Upon opening the RTF documents, the recipient is infected with QuasarRAT.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Once infected, the malware initiates a request to freegeoip.net to determine the geographical location of the infected host and then beacons to the C2 domain tautiaos.com.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the execution of the QuasarRAT dropper, allowing the malware to create and manage scheduled tasks on the victim's system to maintain beyond a reboot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It is not relevant to creating and managing scheduled tasks.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the infection. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence on a single system.
   - **Persistence:**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Creating and managing scheduled tasks to ensure the malware runs after a reboot is a common persistence technique.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the infected system to control it. While it is part of the attack, it does not directly involve creating and managing scheduled tasks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of the QuasarRAT dropper infects the system.
   - To ensure the malware remains on the system even after a reboot, the threat actors would need to use a persistence mechanism.
   - Creating and managing scheduled tasks is a common persistence technique.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the execution of the QuasarRAT dropper is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Persistence
