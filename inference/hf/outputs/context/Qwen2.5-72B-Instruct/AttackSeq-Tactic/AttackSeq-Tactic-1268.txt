### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified target networks.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders and used NodeIISWeb to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 using NodeIISWeb.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 escalated privileges using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll with dynamic DLL loading and token manipulation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where TG1021 gains access to the network.
   - **Execution:** After gaining access, TG1021 executes the memory-resident malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This is the step where TG1021 uses tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll.
   - **Persistence:** This is not mentioned as a step before privilege escalation.
   - **Resource Development:** This is not a step in the attack sequence described.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is clear: Initial Access → Execution → Privilege Escalation.
   - After gaining initial access and executing the malware, the next logical step is to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before privilege escalation is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Execution
