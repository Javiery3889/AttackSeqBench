### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, using advanced reconnaissance to gather information about victims.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by posing as legitimate software updates and seeding P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Collection:** They collect secrets and credentials from local systems, including cached passwords and credentials from browsers and email services.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Darkhotel APT evaded detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypted gathered data in log files, specifically targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.
   - **Resource Development:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.
   - **Initial Access:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.
   - **Execution:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.
   - **Persistence:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This is part of the evasion phase, but the question asks about the next step.
   - **Collection:** This is the phase where the APT collects secrets and credentials, which aligns with the question.
   - **Command and Control:** Not relevant to the post-evasion phase.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This involves moving through the network to access other systems, which is not mentioned in the context of collecting secrets and credentials.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This is part of the evasion phase, not the next step after evasion.
   - **C: Persistence:** This involves maintaining access, which is not the focus of collecting secrets and credentials.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This involves collecting secrets and credentials, which aligns with the described activity.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Credential Access
