### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquired infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install SparrowDoor and exploited the same vulnerabilities to execute it.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after FamousSparrow used SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic is already described in the report as the communication with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications. It is not the next step but a current step.
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. The report does not mention any such activities.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the victim's network to the attacker's control. The report mentions that SparrowDoor can exfiltrate file contents to the C&C server.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The report mentions that SparrowDoor can read file contents, which is part of the Collection phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the report shows that after gaining initial access and establishing command and control, the next logical step would be to collect and exfiltrate data.
   - The report explicitly states that SparrowDoor can read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.
   - While Collection and Exfiltration are closely related, the question asks for the next step after establishing command and control. Exfiltration is the final step in the data theft process, which logically follows Collection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
