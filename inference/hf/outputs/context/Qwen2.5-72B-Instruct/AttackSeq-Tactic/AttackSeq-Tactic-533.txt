### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Tortoiseshell created a fake veteran hiring website to conduct reconnaissance.
     - The website prompted users to download an app, which was a malware downloader.
     - The downloaded reconnaissance tool, named 'bird.exe' with the internal name Liderc, collected extensive information from the victim's machine.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware downloader executed two binaries retrieved from a remote server.
     - These binaries included a reconnaissance tool and a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT), which was executed as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
     - The RAT was modular and required the installer for access, complicating analysis.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The RAT communicated with a C2 server, with the IP address provided as an argument to the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Tortoiseshell executed the malware downloader binaries, including a reconnaissance tool and a RAT, as a service.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware downloader executed two binaries: a reconnaissance tool and a RAT.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The RAT communicated with a C2 server.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - After the execution of the malware downloader binaries (reconnaissance tool and RAT), the next logical step would be to use the collected information for further actions.
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.
     - The RAT, which was executed as a service, would then communicate with the C2 server.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most likely tactic to occur immediately after the execution of the malware downloader binaries is **Discovery**. The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' was designed to collect detailed information about the victim's machine, which aligns with the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Discovery
