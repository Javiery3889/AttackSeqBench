### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Machete campaign used spearphishing emails to gain initial access. These emails contained links to download compressed files or zipped files with malicious contents.
   - **Persistence:** Machete created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files and directories to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Machete scanned for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrated stored credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The malware listed nearby Wi-Fi networks, detected new devices, produced file listings, and enumerated running processes.
   - **Collection:** Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data.
   - **Command and Control:** Machete used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication and implemented fallback channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrated collected data to remote servers, encrypting and compressing it before transmission.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails, involving the use of a downloader to install backdoor components on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains access to the system through spearphishing emails.
   - **Execution:** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the downloaded malicious components. The use of a downloader to install backdoor components aligns with the Execution tactic.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This typically occurs after the malware is already running on the system and the attacker seeks to gain higher privileges.
   - **Command and Control:** This involves establishing communication with the C&C server, which usually happens after the malware is installed and running.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spearphishing emails.
   - Once the victim clicks on the link or opens the zipped file, a downloader is used to install backdoor components on the system.
   - The installation and execution of these components are part of the Execution tactic.
   - After the backdoor components are installed and running, the malware can then proceed to establish persistence, evade defenses, access credentials, discover the environment, collect data, and communicate with the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Execution
