### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email campaign that delivered a URL leading to an archived payload containing an executable and a decoy PDF.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and began sending commands to gather system information, take screenshots, and execute system commands.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking and registry key modifications were used to ensure the backdoor was executed.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Files and processes were deleted and security tools were disabled.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumpers were used to target browsers and email clients to retrieve credential-related databases.
   - **Collection:** The malware scanned for files with specific extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server was established using common ports and encrypted data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were prepared and sent to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Sednit group used dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases and before the group scanned the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases is clearly a part of the Credential Access tactic.
   - **Collection:** Scanning for files with specific extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media is a part of the Collection tactic.
   - The question is asking about the tactic that occurred between these two events.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system and network. It is plausible that the operators might have performed some discovery activities to understand the environment before scanning for specific files.
   - **B: Collection:** This is the tactic that involves gathering data from the system, which is already mentioned as the next step after credential access.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This is the tactic that is already mentioned as the previous step.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with the C&C server, which is a continuous process throughout the attack.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attack sequence starts with Initial Access and Execution.
2. The operators then use dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases, which is part of the Credential Access tactic.
3. After retrieving credentials, the operators need to understand the environment to know where to look for specific files. This is where Discovery comes into play.
4. Following Discovery, the operators scan the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions, which is part of the Collection tactic.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI report is that the operators performed Discovery activities between retrieving credentials and scanning for specific files. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
