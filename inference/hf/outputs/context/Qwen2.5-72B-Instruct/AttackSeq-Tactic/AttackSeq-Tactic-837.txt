### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** PROMETHIUM uses trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The malware is deployed using trojanized installers and uses a service for persistence. It also reconfigures Windows Defender to add exclusions.
   - **Persistence:** A service is created to launch the C2 contact module upon startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware checks for specific antiviruses and adds its directories to Windows Defender exclusions.
   - **Collection:** The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files, compresses them into an archive, and encodes the archive.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 infrastructure includes hardcoded domains and communicates over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that follows the step of sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server after the malware has searched for and compressed Microsoft Office files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The malware searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into an archive.
   - **Exfiltration:** The next logical step after compressing and encoding the archive is to send it to the C2 server. This is the process of exfiltrating the data from the victim's system to the attacker's server.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware, which has already been done.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communication with the C2 server, but it is not the immediate next step after compressing and encoding the archive.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves finding information on the victim's system, which has already been done during the collection phase.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending the collected data to the attacker's server, which is the next logical step after compressing and encoding the archive.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
