### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Dragonfly campaign conducted reconnaissance before exploiting compromised targets, using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers created or gained user accounts to operate stealthily within victim networks, using remote-desktop protocol to hop among systems.
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign targeted energy companies using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
   - **Execution:** Backdoor malware was used to execute code on victims' machines without detection.
   - **Persistence:** Attackers created or gained user accounts to maintain access and used remote-desktop protocol.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Code from TeamViewer was incorporated into the backdoor, and self-deleting code was used to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The group focused on Windows systems and gathered information and credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Remote-desktop protocol was used to move laterally among internal or external systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Dragonfly attackers used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems within victim networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI report is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**
     2. **Resource Development**
     3. **Initial Access**
     4. **Execution**
     5. **Persistence**
     6. **Defense Evasion**
     7. **Discovery**
     8. **Lateral Movement**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement. According to the report, after lateral movement, the next logical steps would be to maintain persistence, gather more information (discovery), or cause impact.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is a plausible next step after lateral movement, as maintaining access to the network is crucial for further operations.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This is the step that is already mentioned in the question, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **C: Impact:** This is a possible next step, but it is typically a final stage of the attack, and the report does not indicate immediate impact after lateral movement.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This is typically an early stage and not likely to occur after lateral movement.

### Final Reasoning
- The most logical next step after lateral movement is to ensure persistence, as maintaining access to the network is essential for further operations and to avoid losing the foothold gained through lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Persistence
