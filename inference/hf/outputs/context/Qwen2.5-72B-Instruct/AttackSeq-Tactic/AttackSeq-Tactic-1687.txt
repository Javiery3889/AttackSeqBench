### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary starts by obtaining usernames and passwords from previous breaches and uses them in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using a PowerShell one-liner and relies on scheduled tasks for executing batch files.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and installs it on systems with high uptimes.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and uses tools like NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access to accounts.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to export Security Event logs and identify privileged users.
   - **Collection:** The adversary collects data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and larger amounts using a custom tool to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the adversary applied a range of discovery tactics, including using PsLogList to export Security Event logs, and before the collection of data from various sources like SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is the first step in the attack sequence and involves gaining access to the network. It occurs before the discovery phase.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the network. It can occur after initial access and discovery but is not a necessary step between discovery and collection.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the network, which the adversary does using tools like PsLogList. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. It often occurs after discovery and before collection, as the adversary uses the information gathered during discovery to move to other systems and collect data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary uses PsLogList to export Security Event logs, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - After discovering the network and identifying valuable systems and data, the adversary would likely move laterally to gain access to these systems.
   - Once the adversary has moved laterally, they can then proceed to collect data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
