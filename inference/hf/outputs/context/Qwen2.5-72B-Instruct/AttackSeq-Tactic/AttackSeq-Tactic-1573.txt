### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attack began with a phishing campaign where a malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae was used to deliver the malware.
- **Execution**: Once the malicious document was opened and the malware executed, it made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware established communication with the C2 domain to receive further instructions.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malware was executed and established communication with multiple C2 domains.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is already covered in the report as the phishing campaign and the delivery of the malicious document.
- **Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or theft, which are not mentioned in the report.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the malware establishing communication with the C2 server to receive further instructions, which is explicitly mentioned in the report.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the compromised system over time, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The report clearly states that after the malware was executed, it made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info. This action is a direct indication of the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the sequence of events described in the report.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
