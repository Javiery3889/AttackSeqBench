### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Defense Evasion**: ChChes uses HTTP cookie headers for C&C communication, with encrypted strings in the cookies.
- **Command and Control**: ChChes communicates with C&C servers to receive commands and modules, using encrypted communication.
- **Others**: ChChes has been active since October 2016 and is monitored by JPCERT/CC. It uses targeted attacks and specific code signing certificates.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved in using targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables before establishing C&C communication.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information and resources to support the attack. It does not directly involve the initial infection vector.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While ChChes uses defense evasion techniques, they are not the initial infection vector.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves techniques to gain a foothold in the target network. Using targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables is a common initial access technique.
- **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. It is not relevant to the initial infection vector.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report describes ChChes as using targeted attacks, which often involve initial access vectors like phishing emails with malicious attachments.
- The question specifically asks about the tactic used before establishing C&C communication, which aligns with the initial access phase of the attack.
- The use of targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables is a common initial access technique.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
