### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email, which contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo.
   - **Execution:** Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor. They also created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence and executed commands via scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Shuckworm utilized mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings. They also used scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection and maintain their foothold.
   - **Collection:** Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts. It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** Shuckworm established command and control by communicating with their servers using HTTP requests and downloading additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and before utilizing mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is already completed by the time the VBS scripts and HTA files are executed.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic occurs later in the attack sequence, after the VBS scripts and HTA files are executed and before the use of mshta.exe.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic is part of the initial steps where VBS scripts and HTA files are executed to maintain presence and execute the backdoor.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic is also part of the initial steps where scheduled tasks are created to ensure persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report indicates that after the initial execution of VBS scripts and HTA files, the next logical step is to ensure persistence. This is achieved by creating scheduled tasks, which is a common method for maintaining a foothold in the compromised system.
   - The use of mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions is a part of the Defense Evasion tactic, which occurs after ensuring persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Persistence
