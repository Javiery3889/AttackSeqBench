### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The OceanLotus Group developed a sophisticated arsenal, including modified publicly-available tools and custom-built tools.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial penetration vector was social engineering through spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.
   - **Execution:** The group used fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads.
   - **Persistence:** They established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They exploited DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling to maintain stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They performed lateral movement and infected new machines.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They expanded control using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
   - **Command and Control:** They used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor for command execution and data exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access through spear-phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for the attack. It is a logical step before initial access, as the attackers need to understand their target to craft effective spear-phishing emails.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary tools and infrastructure for the attack. While it is a crucial step, it is not necessarily a direct precursor to initial access.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target network, which occurs after gaining access.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves understanding the target network, which also occurs after gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails, which are a common method for gaining entry into a target network.
   - Before sending these emails, the attackers would need to gather information about the target to make the emails convincing. This is the essence of the **Reconnaissance** tactic.
   - **Resource Development** is important but is more about preparing the tools and infrastructure, not necessarily the immediate precursor to initial access.
   - **Collection** and **Discovery** occur after gaining access, so they are not relevant to the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
