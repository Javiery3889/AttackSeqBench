### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Discovery:** The discovery phase involved commands like whoami, net user, net group, and Get-NetComputer.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, encrypting computers and servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - The key actions mentioned are:
     - Using commands like whoami and Get-NetComputer for enumeration.
     - Executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, net group, and Get-NetComputer to profile the computer and search for computer objects in the Active Directory database. This is clearly part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers. This is part of the Lateral Movement phase.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump. This is part of the Credential Access phase.
   - **Impact:** The report describes the deployment of WastedLocker ransomware, which is part of the Impact phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the report is as follows:
     1. **Discovery:** The attackers used commands like whoami and Get-NetComputer to gather information about the environment.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** After gathering information, the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers.
   - Therefore, the Discovery phase must have occurred before the Lateral Movement phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
