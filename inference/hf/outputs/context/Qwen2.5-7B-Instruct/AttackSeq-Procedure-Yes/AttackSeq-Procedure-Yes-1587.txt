### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 is delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a legitimate Microsoft executable, `igfxtray.exe`, to sideload a malicious DLL, `hccutils.dll`.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 establishes persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe`.
   - **Collection:** The malware captures data about the infected system and steals files from removable media, targeting Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrates various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to create mutexes and named events to avoid detection before capturing data from an infected system or Skype communications after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the creation of mutexes or named events as part of the T9000 malware's TTPs.
   - The outline focuses on persistence, execution, and data collection methods, but does not detail specific evasion techniques like mutexes or named events.
   - The question is asking about a specific evasion technique (mutexes and named events) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of T9000 using mutexes or named events for evasion. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not use these specific techniques.

**Final Answer: B: No**
