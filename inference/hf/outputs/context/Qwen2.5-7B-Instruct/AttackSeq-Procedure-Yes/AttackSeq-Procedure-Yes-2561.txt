### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Outlaw group used Shellbot to compromise FTP servers and set up an IRC bouncer for command and control.
   - **Execution:** Shellbot is distributed via command injection on IoT devices and Linux servers, and it can affect Windows and Android environments. It was previously spread via Shellshock but now is mostly distributed via brute-forced or compromised hosts.
   - **Persistence:** The Shellbot communicates persistently with C&C servers via IRC and hides from system admins and security monitoring.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware hides its process names and uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open.
   - **Command and Control:** The Shellbot establishes C&C communication immediately after infection and maintains it, using the IRC channel to send commands for various operations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware will gather information about the infected host, such as processor details and installed monitoring tools, before establishing and maintaining the IRC channel for receiving commands and orchestrating operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the malware gathering information about the infected host before establishing the IRC channel. However, the Shellbot is known to be a sophisticated piece of malware that can perform various actions, including gathering information about the host.
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Shellbot can perform commands for port scanning, DDoS attacks, file downloads, and obtaining information about other machines. This suggests that the malware is capable of gathering information about the host.
   - The question is asking about a specific behavior (gathering information about the host) that is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline but is a plausible action for a sophisticated malware like Shellbot.

### Final Answer:
Given the context and the capabilities of the Shellbot as described in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would gather information about the infected host before establishing and maintaining the IRC channel for receiving commands and orchestrating operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
