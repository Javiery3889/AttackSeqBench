Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The spear phishing document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to create a decoy document and a malware dropper named `exp1ore.exe`, which drops `wab.exe` and a malicious DLL, `wab32res.dll`, in the temp folder.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components such as `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll` for achieving initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly states that the spear phishing document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to create a decoy document and a malware dropper named `exp1ore.exe`, which drops `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll` in the temp folder.
- The question is asking if this sequence of actions (exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll`) is likely to occur.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that the spear phishing document uses CVE-2012-0158 to drop `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll` as part of the initial access phase.
- The question is directly asking if this is likely to happen, and based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is indeed likely.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
