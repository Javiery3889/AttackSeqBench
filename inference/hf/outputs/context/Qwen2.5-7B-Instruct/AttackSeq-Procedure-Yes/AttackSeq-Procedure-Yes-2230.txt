### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grabit malware is delivered via a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment containing a malicious macro.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies common registry entries, such as startup configurations, without covering its tracks.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware's 'call home' functionality communicates over obvious channels without attempting to hide its activity.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Grabit malware, after establishing persistence, is likely to include a Keylogger functionality that prepares files acting as containers for keyboard interrupts to collect hostnames, application names, usernames, and passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any keylogger functionality. However, it does provide details about the malware's persistence and communication methods.
   - The malware's persistence is established by modifying common registry entries, which is a typical method for malware to ensure it runs on system startup.
   - The malware's communication is described as straightforward and not attempting to hide its activity, which suggests it is not using sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - The outline does not provide any information about the malware's capabilities beyond persistence and communication. It does not mention any data exfiltration methods or keylogging.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the inclusion of keylogger functionality. The malware's behavior described focuses on persistence and communication, without any indication of data collection through keylogging.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not include keylogger functionality.

**Final Answer: B: No**
