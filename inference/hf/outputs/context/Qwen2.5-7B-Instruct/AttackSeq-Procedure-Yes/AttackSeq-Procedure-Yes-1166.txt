### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and includes detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware configures specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
   - **Exfiltration:** Longhorn exfiltrates data at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline already indicates that Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, such as:
     - Configuring specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers.
     - Using privacy services to hide their real identity.
     - Communicating with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
     - Randomizing communication intervals to avoid detection.
   - These measures align with the Vault 7 documents, which detail tactics to avoid detection and maintain operational security.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the CTI outline explicitly mentions Longhorn's use of operational security measures to avoid detection, it is highly likely that their tools follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
