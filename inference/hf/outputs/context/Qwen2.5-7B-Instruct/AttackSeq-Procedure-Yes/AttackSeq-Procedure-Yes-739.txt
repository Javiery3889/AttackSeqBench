### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers collected information on their targets, tailoring their phishing emails based on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used phishing emails with fake security alerts and Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials.
   - **Persistence:** In some cases, the hackers did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images. They also used a hidden tracking image in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, the attackers are likely to verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - However, the outline does not explicitly mention the attackers verifying victims' credentials in real-time or prompting for 2-step verification codes. The persistence tactic described involves monitoring communications in real-time without changing passwords, but it does not specify the use of 2-step verification prompts.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - While the attackers used images to bypass security, there is no direct evidence in the CTI outline to support the claim that they would verify credentials in real-time and prompt for 2-step verification codes.
   - **B: No** - This answer is more plausible because the CTI outline does not provide any information supporting the use of 2-step verification prompts, and the persistence tactic described does not involve such actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
