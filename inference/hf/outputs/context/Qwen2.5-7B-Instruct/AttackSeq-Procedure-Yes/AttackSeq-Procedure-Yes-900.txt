Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The OceanLotus group uses a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown' delivered via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros and RAR archives.
- **Execution**: The malicious Office document contains an image file with a message in Vietnamese, asking the victim to enable macros. The document has two different base64 blobs inserted, with the font size changed to 1 to evade detection. Depending on the victim's system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), the appropriate base64 encoded blob is decoded and executed.
- **Command and Control**: The final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is downloaded from a URL based on the victim's OS architecture.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic after decoding and executing the appropriate base64 encoded blob.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention process injection or in-memory execution as part of the execution phase. It only describes the decoding and execution of the appropriate base64 encoded blob based on the system architecture.
- Process injection and in-memory execution are common techniques used by malware to evade detection by anti-virus software and other security measures. However, the CTI outline does not provide any direct evidence or context suggesting that KerrDown uses these techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the delivery and execution of the malware through specific methods (Office documents and RAR archives) and the decoding of the appropriate payload based on the system architecture.
- There is no mention of process injection or in-memory execution in the provided information.
- Given the lack of evidence supporting the use of process injection or in-memory execution, the most plausible answer is that these techniques are not part of the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer: B: No
