### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The group used spear phishing and their own botnet for initial access.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Mimikatz, MBR Eraser, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Cain & Abel, SSHD backdoor, Ammy Admin, and Team Viewer were used.
   - **Persistence:** They gained access to ATM management infrastructure and email/workflow servers, and configured remote access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used RDPdoor, MBR Eraser, and legitimate programs like Ammy Admin and Team Viewer.
   - **Credential Access:** Compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Used Metasploit, VNC scanning, password brute forcing, and RDP Wrapper for lateral movement.
   - **Impact:** Changed ATM operating system registry to allow cash withdrawal and used a modified debug program for issuing money.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Anunak malware will connect to backends using backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities after leveraging Metasploit for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of backconnect SSL or DNS tunneling for command and control activities.
   - The outline does mention the use of Metasploit for lateral movement, but it does not specify the methods used for command and control.
   - The Anunak malware is mentioned in the context of targeted attacks, but the specific methods of command and control are not detailed.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of backconnect SSL or DNS tunneling for command and control activities.
   - The question asks for a likelihood, and based on the available information, it is not supported.

**Final Answer: B: No**
