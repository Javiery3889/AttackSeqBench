Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader that employs ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. The script is hosted on Discord CDNs.
- **Persistence**: The VBScript named Login1.vbs is placed in the Startup folder, which ensures the execution of the SystemLogin.bat batch file upon system startup.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Blind Eagle's attack sequence involves:
1. A JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. The PowerShell commands being hosted on Discord CDNs.
3. Leveraging a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access involves a JavaScript downloader that uses ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands, and these commands are hosted on Discord CDNs.
- The persistence phase is described as a VBScript named Login1.vbs placed in the Startup folder, which ensures the execution of SystemLogin.bat upon system startup.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline matches the sequence described in the question exactly.
- The JavaScript downloader and ActiveXObject are mentioned in the initial access phase.
- The PowerShell commands are hosted on Discord CDNs.
- The VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence is also mentioned.

Given this alignment, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
