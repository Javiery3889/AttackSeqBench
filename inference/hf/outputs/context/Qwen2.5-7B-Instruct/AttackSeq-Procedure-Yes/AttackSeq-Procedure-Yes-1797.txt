Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) by embedding it within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).
2. **Defense Evasion**: The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific dropper executable like Rdws.exe. It only states that the attackers used a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- The sideloading technique is described as part of the defense evasion tactic, which follows the initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about a dropper executable named Rdws.exe.
- The sideloading technique is explicitly mentioned as part of the defense evasion tactic, which comes after the initial access.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that a dropper executable was used for the sideloading technique.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of a dropper executable named Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading.

### Final Answer: B: No
