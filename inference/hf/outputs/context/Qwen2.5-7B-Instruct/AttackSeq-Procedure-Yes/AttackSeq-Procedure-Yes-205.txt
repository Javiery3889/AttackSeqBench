Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Utilization of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creation of registry Run key entries and installation as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Injection of encrypted shellcode and token privilege adjustments.
7. **Discovery**: Collection of system information and probing of files.
8. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
9. **Command and Control**: Communication with the C&C server using HTTPS.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that after executing SparrowDoor using `cmd.exe`, FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase before dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution**: SparrowDoor is executed using `cmd.exe`.
- **Discovery**: The CTI report explicitly mentions that SparrowDoor collects system information and probes files.
- **Credential Access**: The CTI report does not mention any specific Credential Access TTPs, such as using Mimikatz.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Execution**: The CTI report confirms that SparrowDoor is executed using `cmd.exe`.
2. **Discovery**: The CTI report clearly states that SparrowDoor collects system information and probes files, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
3. **Credential Access**: The CTI report does not provide any information about using Mimikatz or any other specific Credential Access TTPs.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after executing SparrowDoor, it will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase. There is no mention of any specific Credential Access TTPs in the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
