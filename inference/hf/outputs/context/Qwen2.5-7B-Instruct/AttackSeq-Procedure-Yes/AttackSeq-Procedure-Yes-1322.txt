Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
- **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
- **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and exports certificates.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
- **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention CosmicDuke searching for files or targeting non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations.
- The outline does mention that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, but it does not specify any file search operations or targeting non-English filenames.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the methods CosmicDuke uses to achieve persistence, steal credentials, and collect information. It does not provide any specific details about file searching or targeting non-English filenames.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (searching for files and targeting non-English filenames) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to support the claim that CosmicDuke searches for files and targets non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations.

### Final Answer: B: No
