### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices.
   - **Resource Development:** They have advanced capabilities in compromising trusted commercial network resources and maintaining a large, dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sharing sites with their malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy various malware components, including small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates and encryption techniques to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They encrypt and store collected data in log files.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware after deploying small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of autorun registry settings for persistence. However, it does describe the use of various malware components and advanced techniques for maintaining access and control over compromised systems.
   - Autorun registry settings are a common method for maintaining persistence, but the CTI outline does not provide specific information about this technique being used by the Darkhotel APT.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the detailed information provided in the CTI outline, the Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated and advanced techniques, but the specific use of autorun registry settings is not mentioned. Therefore, while it is possible that they might use such techniques, the outline does not provide enough evidence to confirm this.

**Final Answer: B: No**
