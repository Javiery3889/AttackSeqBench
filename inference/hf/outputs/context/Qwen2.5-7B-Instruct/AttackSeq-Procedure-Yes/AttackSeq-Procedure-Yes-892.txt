### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access, often through malicious URLs that exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255.
   - **Execution:** APT28 delivers malware through exploit documents, which can include vulnerabilities to install malware like GAMEFISH.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 uses zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
   - **Credential Access:** APT28 harvests credentials through spear-phishing and credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers after harvesting credentials during the Lateral Movement phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that APT28 has used known vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255) for initial access and execution.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the Lateral Movement phase, which is not directly addressed in the CTI outline. The outline does mention that APT28 uses legitimate tools and zero-day vulnerabilities for lateral movement, but it does not explicitly state the use of known vulnerabilities in this phase.
   - Given the context, APT28's preference for using legitimate tools and zero-day vulnerabilities suggests they might not rely on known vulnerabilities for lateral movement, as zero-day vulnerabilities are more effective for evading detection.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline and the context provided, it is less likely that APT28 would use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers during the Lateral Movement phase, as they prefer more sophisticated methods like zero-day vulnerabilities and legitimate tools.

**Final Answer: B: No**
