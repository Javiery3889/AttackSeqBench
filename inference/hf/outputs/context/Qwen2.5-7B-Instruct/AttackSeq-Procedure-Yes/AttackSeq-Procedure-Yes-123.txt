Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and deployment of additional malware.
3. **Persistence**: Achieved persistence through webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells with obfuscation and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to evade detection.
5. **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts for lateral movement.
6. **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, awaiting commands for various actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the 'IPsec Helper' sends recon information or downloads files, Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.
- The 'IPsec Helper' is described as a backdoor for data exfiltration and deployment of additional malware, but no specific wipers or destructive malware are mentioned.
- The outline focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control, but does not include any data destruction activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.
- The 'IPsec Helper' is a backdoor for data exfiltration and deployment, but no destructive actions are mentioned.
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy these specific wipers after sending recon information or downloading files, which is not supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
