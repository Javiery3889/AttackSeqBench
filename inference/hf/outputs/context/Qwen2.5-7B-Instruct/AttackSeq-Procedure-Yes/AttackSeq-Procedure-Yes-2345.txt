### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops and uses various tools, including Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.
   - **Execution:** Uses Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession for execution.
   - **Persistence:** Uses WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses native tools like vssadmin.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Minimizes detection by deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Collects credentials and password hashes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Leverages Wmiexec and net commands.
   - **Collection:** Uses custom batch scripts to collate files into archives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uses RCSession and Cobalt Strike for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use ORat with a raw socket protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after using scripts to collect files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses various tools for C2, including Cobalt Strike and RCSession.
   - ORat is mentioned as one of the tools used by the group, but there is no specific mention of ORat using a raw socket protocol for C2.
   - The question is asking about a specific communication method (raw socket protocol) for a specific tool (ORat) in a specific phase (Collection).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information that directly supports the use of ORat with a raw socket protocol for C2 communication.
   - The question is asking about a specific detail that is not supported by the provided information.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: B: No
