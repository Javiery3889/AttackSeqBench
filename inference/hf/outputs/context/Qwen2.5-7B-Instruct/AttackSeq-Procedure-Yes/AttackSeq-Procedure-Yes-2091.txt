Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
From the CTI outline, we can extract the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
2. **Execution**: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, and delete files.
3. **Persistence**: Establish persistence using a backdoor from the C&C server.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Find admin-level credentials and use them.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Perform operations outside business hours, limit interaction, and use single workstations as a hub.
6. **Credential Access**: Compromise credentials for a Domain Administrator.
7. **Discovery**: Use the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative-level credentials.
8. **Collection**: Collect and prepare valuable documents for exfiltration.
9. **Command and Control**: Use Cobalt Strike for command and control.
10. **Exfiltration**: Prepare documents for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the likelihood of the attackers moving laterally across the infrastructure after discovering and mapping the internal network and collecting administrative-level credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery**: The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials.
- **Lateral Movement**: The next logical step after discovering and mapping the network and having administrative credentials would be to move laterally across the infrastructure to compromise numerous workstations and target internal hosts and servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that after the discovery phase, the attackers would use the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network and collect credentials.
- The next phase, based on the typical attack lifecycle, is to move laterally across the infrastructure to compromise additional systems and gain access to more valuable data.
- The question specifically asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally after these actions, and the context provided in the CTI outline supports this likelihood.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
