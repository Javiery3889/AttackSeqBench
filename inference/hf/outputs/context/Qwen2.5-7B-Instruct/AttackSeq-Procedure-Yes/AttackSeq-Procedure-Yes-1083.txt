Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the attack sequence in the following order:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used malicious documents sent via various communication channels (LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, corporate email) to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Malicious code was executed using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
3. **Persistence**: Services and local administrator accounts were created for persistence.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques such as encryption and hiding malware were used to evade detection.
6. **Discovery**: Information was collected using system utilities and SMBMap.
7. **Lateral Movement**: Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally on the network.
8. **Command and Control (C2)**: The group communicated with C2 servers using a self-designed encryption algorithm and disguised as legitimate domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the use of the HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers, which were disguised as legitimate domains and hosted on resources located in various countries.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of the HTTP protocol for C2 communication.
- The outline states that the C2 communication was done using a self-designed encryption algorithm and disguised as legitimate domains.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware leveraged the HTTP protocol for C2 communication, which is not aligned with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of the HTTP protocol for C2 communication.
- The outline mentions that the C2 communication was done using a self-designed encryption algorithm and disguised as legitimate domains.
- Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the malware leveraged the HTTP protocol for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: No**
