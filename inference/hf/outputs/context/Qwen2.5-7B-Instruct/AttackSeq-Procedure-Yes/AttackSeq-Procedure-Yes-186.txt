### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges, and replaces the legitimate netd binary.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary at `/system/bin/netd`.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Collection:** The netd component collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after persistently replacing the legitimate netd binary and executing shell scripts as the root user, Infamous Chisel's netd component will list installed packages as part of its software discovery before collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any steps related to listing installed packages as part of the software discovery process.
   - The collection process described in the CTI outline focuses on collecting files based on predefined file extensions and from specific directories.
   - There is no information provided that suggests the malware performs a software discovery step, such as listing installed packages, before collecting files.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that Infamous Chisel's netd component performs a software discovery step, such as listing installed packages, before collecting files from application and data directories. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include this step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
