Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent to Indian embassies, containing weaponized RTF documents that dropped an embedded, encoded PE named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.
- **Command and Control**: The MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication. Some of its modules lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, following the initial access through weaponized RTF documents, the MSIL/Crimson malware will:
1. Execute on the victim's machine.
2. Download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001.
3. Establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that the weaponized RTF documents dropped an embedded, encoded PE file (svchost.exe) with downloader functionality. This indicates that the malware will execute on the victim's machine.
- **Download Full RAT Component**: The CTI outline mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware is modular and that additional payloads are downloaded by the main RAT module. This suggests that the malware will indeed download the full RAT component.
- **Command and Control**: The CTI outline also states that the MSIL/Crimson malware utilizes a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication. This aligns with the question's statement about establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides clear evidence that the malware will execute on the victim's machine after the initial access.
- The malware is modular, and the CTI outline indicates that additional payloads, including the full RAT component, are downloaded.
- The malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication, which matches the question's statement.

Given this analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
