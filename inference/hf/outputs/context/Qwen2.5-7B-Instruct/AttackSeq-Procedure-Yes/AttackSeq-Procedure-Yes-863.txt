Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Resource Development**: GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework with functionality defined by uploaded modules.
- **Initial Access**: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers as infection vectors.
- **Persistence**: Securely wipes malware components from victims' hard drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses stealth techniques, including partial encryption and running modules in memory.
- **Credential Access**: Uses tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner for credential access.
- **Lateral Movement**: Deploys internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server.
- **Command and Control**: Uses internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if GreyEnergy is likely to proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts after using a modular malware framework.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development**: GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
- **Credential Access**: GreyEnergy uses tools for credential access, which is a critical step in gaining access to ICS control workstations and servers.
- **Lateral Movement**: GreyEnergy deploys internal C&C proxies to move laterally within the network, which is a key step in reconnaissance and information gathering.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Resource Development**: GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps.
2. **Credential Access**: GreyEnergy uses tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain access to systems, which is a critical step in reconnaissance.
3. **Lateral Movement**: GreyEnergy deploys internal C&C proxies to move laterally within the network, which is essential for gathering information from ICS control workstations and servers.

Given the context of GreyEnergy's TTPs, it is highly likely that they would proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
