### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** GreyEnergy targets energy companies and high-value organizations in Ukraine and Poland.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware framework is modular and uses a 'mini' backdoor before deploying the full version.
   - **Initial Access:** GreyEnergy uses two distinct infection vectors: spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers.
   - **Persistence:** The operators securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses common tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Deploys internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to an external C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if GreyEnergy is likely to use initial access vectors such as spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that GreyEnergy uses two distinct infection vectors: spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers.
   - These vectors are described as primary and backup reinfection vectors, indicating that they are used to gain initial access to the target network.
   - The stealth techniques mentioned (partial AES-256 encryption of modules) are described as methods used to cover tracks and evade detection after initial access has been gained.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, GreyEnergy indeed uses initial access vectors such as spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
