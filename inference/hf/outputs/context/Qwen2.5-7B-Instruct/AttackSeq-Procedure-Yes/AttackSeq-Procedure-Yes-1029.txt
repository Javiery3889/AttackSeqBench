Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group. Here is the relevant part for the collection and command and control phases:

- **Collection**: The malware searches for sensitive documents on the local system and scans all drives, including removable drives and network shares mounted as drives, for sensitive data. It also takes screenshots every minute and deploys scripts that automatically scan for interesting documents.
- **Command and Control**: The group's malware uses both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after deploying their malware to search for sensitive documents and take screenshots during the collection phase, it is likely that Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware searches for sensitive documents and takes screenshots, which aligns with the collection phase.
- The question asks about the exfiltration phase, which is not explicitly detailed in the CTI outline. However, the outline does mention the use of both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control, which suggests that the malware can communicate with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware uploads harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase. However, the use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control implies that the malware can communicate with the C&C server.
- Given the nature of the malware's activities (searching for sensitive documents and taking screenshots), it is reasonable to assume that the malware would also upload these documents to the C&C server for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
