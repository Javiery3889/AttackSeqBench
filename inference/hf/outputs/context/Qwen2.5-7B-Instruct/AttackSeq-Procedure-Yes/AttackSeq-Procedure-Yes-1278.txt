Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper uses Tropic Trooper (KeyBoy) to execute commands through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are security flaws in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). They download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection, as the malicious wab32res.dll was loaded by a benign file, sidebar.exe. The installer dropped three files into the Apple/Update directory and created one hidden directory (UFile) into C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\, likely as a ruse.
4. **Command and Control**: TClient uses SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server. The C&C server and some configuration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor, allowing Tropic Trooper's operators to easily change/update the C&C server and configure other values.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the system will drop a backdoor installer and prepare for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe before the backdoor achieves persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Backdoor Installer**: The CTI outline mentions that the installer package (.msi) is dropped and installed on the system.
- **BITSadmin and UserInstall.exe**: There is no mention of BITSadmin or UserInstall.exe in the CTI outline. The outline describes the backdoor installer as part of the persistence mechanism, where it loads an encrypted configuration file and connects to the C&C server.
- **Persistence**: The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file and uses SSL to connect to the C&C server, which is part of the persistence mechanism.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of BITSadmin or UserInstall.exe in the sequence of TTPs.
- The backdoor installer is part of the persistence mechanism, where it loads the encrypted configuration file and connects to the C&C server.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question (dropping a backdoor installer and preparing for execution of BITSadmin by UserInstall.exe) does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: No
