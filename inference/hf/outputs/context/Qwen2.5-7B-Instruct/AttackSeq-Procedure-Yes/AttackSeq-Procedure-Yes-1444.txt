Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer to the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware.
3. **Execution**: The malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern with an encrypted MAC address.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, decrypts it, and uses a modified version of the Taidoor malware. The network traffic pattern is also changed to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the new Taidoor variant, after using a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware, is likely to communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the Taidoor malware has evolved to use a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware. This indicates that the malware is capable of updating itself and changing its behavior.
- The outline also states that the malware has changed its network traffic pattern to avoid detection. This suggests that the malware is designed to communicate with its CnC server in a way that is not easily detected.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Taidoor malware has shown the capability to update itself and change its communication patterns to avoid detection.
- The question asks if the new variant will communicate with the specific CnC servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw. The CTI outline does not provide any specific information about these servers being used by Taidoor. However, the malware's behavior of changing its communication patterns to avoid detection suggests that it could use any server that is not easily detectable.
- Given the context and the malware's known behavior, it is plausible that the new variant could use any CnC server, including roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw, as long as it is not easily detectable.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
