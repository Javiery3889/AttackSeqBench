Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: The attackers have updated their malware, Aumlib and Ixeshe, to encode HTTP communications and network traffic patterns, respectively.
- **Defense Evasion**: The updated Aumlib now encodes its HTTP POST body to evade detection by IDS signatures. Ixeshe uses a different Base64 encoding pattern to evade detection.
- **Others**: The attackers, known as APT12, have been silent since January and have now re-emerged with improved malware. They have deliberately evolved their tactics in response to external pressures.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the Aumlib malware will download its updated sample from specific URLs and share code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Aumlib downloading an updated sample from specific URLs or sharing code with an older variant.
- The focus of the CTI outline is on the changes in encoding techniques to evade detection, not on the specific command and control (C2) activities.
- The "Others" section mentions that the attackers have evolved their tactics, but it does not provide specific details about downloading or sharing code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline primarily discusses the changes in encoding techniques to evade detection.
- There is no direct information about Aumlib downloading updated samples or sharing code with older variants.
- The question asks about a specific C2 activity that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the CTI outline does not support the specific C2 activity described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
