### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Persistence:** The group drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.
   - **Command and Control:** The group deploys custom malware like WellMess or WellMail for further operations.
   - **Others:** Additional context about APT29's tactics and targets is provided, but is secondary to the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT29, after gaining initial access, will drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistence.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that "Upon gaining access to a system, the group likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access."
   - This directly aligns with the "Yes" option in the answer choices.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
