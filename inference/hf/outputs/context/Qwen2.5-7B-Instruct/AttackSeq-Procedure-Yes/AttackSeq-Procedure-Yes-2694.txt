### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites.
   - **Initial Access:** Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Elfin has deployed various custom and commodity malware.
   - **Persistence:** Elfin created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Elfin used PowerShell commands and various tools to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Elfin used DarkComet for credential dumping.
   - **Command and Control:** Elfin used POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT for C&C.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Elfin, after establishing command and control using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, likely proceeded to exfiltrate data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific data exfiltration tools or methods beyond the use of POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for C&C.
   - The question introduces new tools (custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader) that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence or mention of Elfin using a custom .NET FTP tool or FastUploader for data exfiltration. The CTI outline focuses on the methods used for C&C and does not provide any details about the specific tools used for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
