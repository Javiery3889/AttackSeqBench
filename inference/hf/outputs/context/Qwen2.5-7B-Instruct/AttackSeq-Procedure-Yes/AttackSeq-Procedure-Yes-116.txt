Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Agrius exploited public-facing applications, likely using publicly available exploits.
   - They uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

2. **Persistence:**
   - Agrius deployed webshells and registered a custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service on compromised systems.

3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor was used to update itself and delete traces of itself to evade defenses.
   - Webshells were obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function.

4. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement.

5. **Command and Control:**
   - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, based on a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses.
   - The malware awaited commands from these relays, which included updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

6. **Impact:**
   - Agrius deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, to destroy data on targeted systems.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is primarily used for communication with C2 servers, command execution, and maintaining persistence. It is not explicitly mentioned as being used for exfiltrating data. The backdoor's main functionalities include updating itself, deleting traces, and receiving commands for various actions such as reconnaissance and file downloads.

**Answer Choices:**
A: Yes
B: No

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI outline does not indicate that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for exfiltrating data. It is primarily used for communication and command execution.
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor would be utilized to exfiltrate data, which is not a primary function of the 'IPsec Helper' as described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
