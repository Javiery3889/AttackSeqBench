### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Outlaw group used Shellbot to compromise FTP servers and set up an IRC bouncer for command and control.
   - **Execution:** Shellbot is distributed via command injection on IoT devices and Linux servers, and it can affect Windows and Android environments. It was previously spread via Shellshock but now is mostly distributed via brute-forced or compromised hosts.
   - **Persistence:** The bot communicates persistently with C&C servers via IRC, and restarting the infected machine does not revert the changes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The bot hides from system admins and security monitoring by assigning hardcoded process names and uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open.
   - **Discovery:** The bot gathers information about the infected host, including processor details and the presence of monitoring tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gathering information about the infected host, the Shellbot is likely to establish C&C communication via an IRC channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Shellbot communicates persistently with C&C servers via IRC. This indicates that the bot uses IRC for command and control.
   - The discovery phase involves gathering information about the infected host, which aligns with the sequence of events described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, the Shellbot is indeed likely to establish C&C communication via an IRC channel after gathering information about the infected host. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
