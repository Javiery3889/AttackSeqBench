Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing campaign using malicious MS Office documents.
   - **Execution:** Malicious macros to download malware, including the RMS tool.
   - **Persistence:** RMS executable added to the Windows registry Run key for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of RMS for reconnaissance and lateral movement, leveraging its legitimate appearance to evade detection.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the RMS executable attempting to connect to a C2 server in Germany and the use of the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide any specific information about the C2 server location or the use of the ServHelper backdoor.
   - The outline focuses on the use of RMS for persistence and evasion, but does not mention any specific C2 infrastructure or backdoors.
   - The question introduces new elements (C2 server in Germany and ServHelper backdoor) that are not supported by the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no basis to conclude that the RMS executable will attempt to connect to a C2 server in Germany or that TA505 will utilize the ServHelper backdoor.

**Final Answer: No**
