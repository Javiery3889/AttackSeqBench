Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Execution:** Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional files (syn.exe and 1.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Installation of the Milestone backdoor, which creates a service named msupdate2 and masquerades as Microsoft newdev.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creation of a new administrator user and execution of another instance of the backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with a C2 server uncompressed, and support for sending information about current sessions to the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture. It also supports sending information about current sessions to the C2 server.
   - The question specifically asks about exfiltration of data over the C2 channel after these discovery activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Milestone backdoor has the capability to gather system information and capture the screen, which are forms of data exfiltration.
   - The backdoor also supports sending information about current sessions to the C2 server, which aligns with the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

Given the capabilities described in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after performing discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
