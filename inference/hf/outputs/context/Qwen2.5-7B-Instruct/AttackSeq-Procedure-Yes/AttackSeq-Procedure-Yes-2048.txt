Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services, Instagram, and other entities to extract credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign involved sending socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists to invite victims to events.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used email trackers and cookies to gather data.
   - **Credential Access:** Phishing websites were created to steal credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** Multiple servers were used to host the fake websites and control them.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the campaign's first stage involved sending socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists to invite victims to events. This aligns with the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The outline also states that the group expanded its activities to target influential public figures worldwide, which includes non-Iranian researchers.
   - The attribution to Charming Kitten is based on factors such as the impersonation of NIAC (which is likely a reference to a non-Iranian entity) and the targeting of non-Iranian investigators.

Given the information, it is clear that Charming Kitten did target non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
