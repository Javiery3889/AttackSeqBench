Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious macros or links to OneDrive.
- **Defense Evasion**: 
  - GHOLE malware uses a .DLL file with an export function named 'function' instead of 'gholee'.
  - GHOLE malware uses hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication.
  - CWoolger keylogger creates a mutex called 'woolger' and a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of actions after the persistence mechanisms (VBScript 'wsc.vbs' and mutex 'woolger') have been established. Specifically, it asks if the GHOLE malware will communicate with its C&C servers and if the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the CWoolger keylogger creates a mutex called 'woolger' and a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' to establish persistence mechanisms.
- The question asks about the communication with C&C servers and the upload of keystroke logs.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers. However, it does mention that the CWoolger keylogger is used for keylogging, which implies that keystroke logs are collected.
- The GHOLE malware is described as using hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication, which suggests that communication with C&C servers is a part of its TTPs.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will communicate with its C&C servers and the keylogger will upload keystroke logs, but the specific size of the logs (exceeding 3,000 bytes) is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:
Final Answer: A: Yes
