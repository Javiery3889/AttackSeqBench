Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: A malicious Word document using DDE with PowerShell is used to execute arbitrary code.
2. **Execution**: The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt to run PowerShell, which then downloads and executes encoded commands.
3. **Persistence**: The document downloads a file from a URL and creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after leveraging DDE via PowerShell to achieve execution, the document is likely to create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly states that the second PowerShell command is Base64 encoded and is found in the version of `config.txt` received from the remote server. This command downloads a file from a URL and creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
- The question directly asks about the creation of a batch file and a registry entry for persistence after the initial execution via DDE and PowerShell.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that the document uses DDE to execute PowerShell, which then downloads and executes encoded commands.
- After the execution of these commands, the document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
- The question is asking if this persistence mechanism is likely to occur after the initial execution via DDE and PowerShell, which aligns perfectly with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
