### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used SSH, RDP, and VPNs to gain access.
   - **Persistence:** They used credential hopping, WMI persistence with TrailBlazer, and O365 Service Principals.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They stole browser cookies and renamed utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** They stole web session cookies and used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
   - **Discovery:** They used AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools to gather information.
   - **Collection:** They accessed data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after accessing data from Information Repositories, the threat actor is likely to use privileged and non-privileged accounts through RDP for Lateral Movement before configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline indicates that the threat actor uses RDP for lateral movement and persistence. Specifically, they use accounts with Delegated Administrator rights and create persistence via WMI with TrailBlazer.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the outlined attack sequence. The threat actor would likely use RDP for lateral movement to access different systems and then configure persistence using TrailBlazer malware for WMI.

### Final Answer:
The question asks if the threat actor will use privileged and non-privileged accounts through RDP for Lateral Movement before configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence. Based on the CTI outline, this sequence is plausible and follows the outlined attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
