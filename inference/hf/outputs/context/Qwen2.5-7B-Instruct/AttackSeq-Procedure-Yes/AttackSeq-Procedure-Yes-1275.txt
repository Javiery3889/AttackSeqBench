Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Using macro-enabled template files for initial access.
2. **Persistence**: Maintaining persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Disrupting analysis efforts by staging the infection chain remotely and using RC4-encrypted strings.
4. **Credential Access**: Extensive credential harvesting via phishing sites and a Telegram 'grabber' tool.
5. **Collection**: Collecting messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts using the Telegram 'grabber' tool.
6. **Data Storage**: Storing the exfiltrated data in a SQLite database and JSON format.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool is likely to be exfiltrated over the web and stored in a SQLite database and JSON format.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we can see that the collection of data from Telegram accounts is followed by the storage of this data in a SQLite database and JSON format. The question directly asks about the storage and exfiltration of this data, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.
- It also mentions that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that the data is exfiltrated over the web before being stored.

Given this information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data is stored in a SQLite database and JSON format after collection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
