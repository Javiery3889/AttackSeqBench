Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: RIG EK uses malvertising or visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript to deliver exploits.
- **Execution**: Upon successful execution, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
- **Defense Evasion**: RIG EK uses proxy servers and an integrated Antivirus testing feature.
- **Command and Control**: RIG EK's infrastructure includes VDS, proxy servers, and an API server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly states that RIG EK delivers exploits through "malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript."
- This aligns directly with the question's scenario of using malvertising to redirect users to a landing page.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly mentions that RIG EK uses malvertising as a method of initial access.
- The question asks if RIG EK is likely to use this method before redirecting users to its landing page.
- Given the information provided, the answer is affirmative.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
