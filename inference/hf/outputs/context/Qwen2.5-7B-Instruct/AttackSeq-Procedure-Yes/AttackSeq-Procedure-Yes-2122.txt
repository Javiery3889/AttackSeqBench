Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Use of DESLoader to execute various payloads.
3. **Persistence**: Registration of scheduled tasks to load DESLoader.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Sophisticated techniques including fileless implants and removal of event logs.
5. **Credential Access**: Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, and use of tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials.
6. **Discovery**: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
7. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting, using IP addresses for C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the A41APT campaign, after conducting discovery activities, will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports after initial access.
- The attackers used administrator accounts to deploy RDP to servers and executed tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials from systems.
- Discovery activities included scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, which are common methods for lateral movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers gained access via SSL-VPN abuse.
2. **Discovery**: They conducted extensive discovery activities, including scanning for open RDP and SMB ports.
3. **Credential Access**: They used tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials, which can be used for RDP access.
4. **Lateral Movement**: Given the discovery of open RDP and SMB ports, it is highly likely that the attackers would use RDP for lateral movement to target servers within the network.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
