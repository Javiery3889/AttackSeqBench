### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The threat actor uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access involves spear-phishing emails with documents that exploit vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352) and a watering hole attack that downloads a malicious PowerPoint document.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Collection:** The file-stealer module collects specific file types (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after stealing Google Chrome credentials, the backdoor is likely to ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the backdoor pinging the C2 server at regular intervals. The focus is on the execution phase where the backdoor downloads additional malware and the collection phase where specific file types are collected and uploaded.
   - The outline does not provide any information about the backdoor's behavior in terms of regular pings to the C2 server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the backdoor pinging the C2 server at regular intervals. The outline focuses on the execution and collection phases without detailing the backdoor's communication behavior.

**Final Answer: B: No**
