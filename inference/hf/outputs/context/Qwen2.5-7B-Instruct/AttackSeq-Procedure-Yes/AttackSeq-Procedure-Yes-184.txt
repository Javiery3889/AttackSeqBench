Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Persistence**: Infamous Chisel persists by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path `/system/bin/netd`.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The malware is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
- **Collection**: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions. It also collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after persisting by replacing the legitimate netd system binary, Infamous Chisel is likely to perform file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories before collecting files from local systems and application directories containing communication data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention file and directory discovery as a separate step. However, it does state that Infamous Chisel collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline is:
  1. Persistence: Replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
  2. Privilege Escalation: Executing as root.
  3. Collection: Collecting files from the local system and application/data directories.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide a specific step for file and directory discovery. The collection step directly mentions collecting files from application and data directories.
- Given the information, it is more plausible that Infamous Chisel would directly collect files from the specified directories without an explicit file and directory discovery step.

### Final Answer: B: No
