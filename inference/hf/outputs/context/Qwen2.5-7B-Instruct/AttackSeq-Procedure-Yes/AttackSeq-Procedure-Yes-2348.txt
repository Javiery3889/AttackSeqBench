### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT uses phishing lures related to national security and law enforcement to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** The group uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files as an initial access vector.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to develop custom remote access tools as part of their resource development before using phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention BRONZE PRESIDENT developing custom remote access tools as part of their resource development before using phishing emails. The initial access vector is described as phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.
   - The outline does mention the use of various remote access tools (Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession) for execution, but it does not indicate that these tools were developed as part of a resource development phase before the initial access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that BRONZE PRESIDENT develops custom remote access tools as part of their resource development before using phishing emails for initial access. The phishing emails are described as the initial access vector, and the remote access tools are mentioned as part of the execution phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
