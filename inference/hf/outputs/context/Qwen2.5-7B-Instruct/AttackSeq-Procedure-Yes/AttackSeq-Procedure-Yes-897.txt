Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The OceanLotus group uses a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown' delivered via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros or RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading.
- **Defense Evasion**: The KerrDown DLL is dropped in the directory 'Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\' as 'main_background.png'. The DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory.
- **Command and Control**: The final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is downloaded from a URL based on the victim's OS architecture.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline mentions that the initial access is via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros or RAR archives. However, it does not specify that the Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
- **Defense Evasion**: The CTI outline states that the KerrDown DLL is dropped as 'main_background.png' and that the payload is executed in memory. There is no mention of the document containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
- **Command and Control**: The CTI outline does not mention the use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that supports the scenario where the Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
- The CTI outline focuses on the delivery mechanism (Office Documents or RAR archives) and the execution of the payload in memory, but it does not mention any specific instructions within the document to enable macros.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the Office document does not contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

**Final Answer: B: No**
