Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI outline describes a DDoS attack where binaries are used to receive instructions from C2 servers.
   - These binaries are W32 Cabinet self-extracting files that drop a variant of the DDoS tool, KernelBot.
   - The configuration files for KernelBot are encoded using single-byte XOR keys.
   - The encoded configuration files instruct the KernelBot to attack various domains and IPs, primarily associated with Next Media or Apple Daily websites, with a few exceptions for the HKGolden forum.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after observing the use of two different single-byte XOR keys, it is likely that attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.
   - The key points are:
     - Use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
     - Launching DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
     - Causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong. It only mentions attacks on Next Media and Apple Daily websites.
   - The term 'total failure' is not used in the CTI outline, but the outline does mention that the attacks are directed at Next Media and Apple Daily websites, which could imply significant disruption.
   - The use of single-byte XOR keys is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the attacks are specifically directed at Next Media and Apple Daily websites, not websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
   - Therefore, the statement in the question is not supported by the CTI outline.

Final Answer: No
