Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: TA505 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U software (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access.
- **Execution**: TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- **Persistence**: TA505 attempted to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task and altering the COM handler to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion after gaining initial access and executing Cobalt Strike Beacon.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings. However, it does mention that the FlawedGrace RAT loader is encoded in Base64.
- The question is asking about the likelihood of storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the FlawedGrace RAT loader is encoded in Base64, which is a common practice for obfuscation and evasion.
- The question is asking about the likelihood of storing the loader as Base64 encoded strings, which is a plausible method for defense evasion.
- While the outline does not explicitly state that the loader is stored as Base64 encoded strings, the practice of encoding malware for evasion is well-documented and aligns with TA505's known tactics.

Given the context and the known practices of TA505, it is reasonable to assume that they would use Base64 encoding for the FlawedGrace RAT loader to evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
