### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign used phishing attacks through email and social media accounts, targeting individuals involved in sanctions against Iran. The phishing emails were designed to look like security alerts from compromised accounts of public figures and used fake Google Drive download pages.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and a hidden tracking image to alert them when a target opened the email.
   - **Credential Access:** The phishing pages were designed for both desktop and mobile versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services, and the attackers verified the victims' credentials in real-time, prompting for 2-step verification codes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Iranian state-backed hackers tailored their targeting approach by gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location after using phishing attacks to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the hackers gathering detailed information about the victims' cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, or geographic location. The focus is on the methods used to gain initial access and maintain persistence.
   - The outline does not provide any information about the hackers conducting reconnaissance or gathering additional information about the victims beyond the initial phishing attack.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the hackers gathering detailed information about the victims' cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, or geographic location. The focus is on the methods used to gain initial access and maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
