Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a detailed sequence of TTPs from Initial Access to Exfiltration. Here are the key points relevant to the question:

- **Initial Access**: Spearphishing campaign with shortened URLs delivering Zebrocy components.
- **Execution**: Control of the backdoor with commands for screenshots, system information, network scanning, and system command execution.
- **Persistence**: Use of COM object hijacking for persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: Deletion of files and killing processes to disable security tools.
- **Credential Access**: Use of dumpers to retrieve credentials from browsers and email clients.
- **Discovery**: Gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.
- **Collection**: Scanning for files, staging data for exfiltration.
- **Exfiltration**: Data preparation and sending to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Collection phase, specifically whether data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a fallback C&C server or the sequence of sending data to the primary C&C server before a fallback.
- The focus of the CTI outline is on the malware's behavior during the Collection and Exfiltration phases, which includes preparing and sending data to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about a fallback C&C server or a sequence of sending data to the primary C&C server before a fallback.
- The question assumes a sequence that is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the data are sent directly to the primary C&C server without any intermediate fallback step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
