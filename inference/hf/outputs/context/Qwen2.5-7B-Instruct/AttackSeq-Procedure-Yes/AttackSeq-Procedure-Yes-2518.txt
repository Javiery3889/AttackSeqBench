Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign used vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts.
2. **Initial Access**: The campaign exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730) and Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397).
3. **Execution**: The campaign executed malicious scripts through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
5. **Credential Access**: The campaign accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to dump OS credentials.
6. **Collection**: The campaign collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails to an actor-controlled email address.
7. **Command and Control**: The campaign used web protocols for command and control activities.
8. **Exfiltration**: The campaign exfiltrated data over alternative protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gaining credential access by dumping OS credentials, the BlueDelta campaign is likely to perform system information discovery by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software before utilizing Roundcube’s managesieve plugin to collect emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access**: The campaign has already accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities.
- **System Information Discovery**: The outline does not explicitly mention a separate step for system information discovery using Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities after credential access.
- **Collection**: The campaign uses Roundcube’s managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails to an actor-controlled email address.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not indicate a separate step for system information discovery using Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities after credential access. The outline suggests that the campaign uses Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities for initial access and execution, but does not mention a specific step for system information discovery after credential access.
- The collection step involves using Roundcube’s managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails, which is a subsequent step after credential access.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include a separate step for system information discovery using Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities after credential access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
