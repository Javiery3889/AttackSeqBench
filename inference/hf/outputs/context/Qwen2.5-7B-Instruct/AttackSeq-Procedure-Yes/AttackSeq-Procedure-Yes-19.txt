### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites, disguised as PowerPoint presentations.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - **Others:** The campaign targets primarily Spanish-speaking regions and includes high-profile victims. The malware uses Python embedded into Windows executables and has components for Mac OS X, Unix, and Android. Indicators of compromise include suspicious domains and a known infection artifact.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any TTPs related to keystroke logging or copying files to a USB device. The persistence mechanism described involves creating a task and installing the malware in a specific directory, but it does not indicate any specific actions for data exfiltration or keystroke logging.
   - The malware's primary characteristics, such as its use of Python and its multi-platform capabilities, suggest it is designed for data collection, but the specific TTPs of keystroke logging and USB exfiltration are not mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of keystroke logging or USB exfiltration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that "Machete" is not likely to perform these specific actions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
