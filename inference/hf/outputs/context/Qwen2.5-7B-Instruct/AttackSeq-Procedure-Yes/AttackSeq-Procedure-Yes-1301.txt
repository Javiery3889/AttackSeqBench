Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
2. **Execution**: Silent code execution via a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882 (T1204 - User Execution)
3. **Defense Evasion**: 
   - File Deletion (T1107)
   - Hidden Files and Directories (T1158)
   - Software Packing (T1045)
4. **Credential Access**: 
   - Credential Dumping (T1003)
   - Credentials in Files (T1081)
   - Credentials in Registry (T1214)
5. **Collection**: Data from Local System (T1005)
6. **Exfiltration**: Data Encrypted (T1002)

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after collecting data from the local system. The specific TTPs mentioned are:
- Collection (T1005)
- Exfiltration (T1002)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question does not explicitly mention sending stolen credentials to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols. Instead, it focuses on the exfiltration process, which is described as data encryption before exfiltration (T1002).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Collection**: The malware collects data from the local system (T1005).
2. **Exfiltration**: The data is encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

The question asks if the stolen credentials will be sent to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols before encryption. However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about sending credentials to a command and control server. The focus is on the encryption and exfiltration of data.

Given the options:
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that the stolen credentials are sent to a command and control server before encryption, which is not supported by the provided information.
- **B: No** - This is the more plausible answer as the CTI outline does not mention sending credentials to a command and control server.

### Final Answer: B: No
