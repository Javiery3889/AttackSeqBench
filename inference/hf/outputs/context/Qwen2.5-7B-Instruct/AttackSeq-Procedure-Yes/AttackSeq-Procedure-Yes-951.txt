### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and sent commands, including taking screenshots, gathering system information, and executing system commands.
   - **Persistence:** The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:** The operators used dumpers to target browsers and email clients for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** The operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - **Collection:** The malware scanned for files with specific extensions and staged data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with the C&C server using commonly used ports and hex-encoded, encrypted data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the file paths prepared for exfiltration were hex-encoded and encrypted before being sent to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware used hex-encoded and encrypted data for communication with the C&C server.
   - The question specifically asks about the exfiltration process, which is part of the "Collection" phase.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the file paths were hex-encoded and encrypted, but it does mention that the data sent to the C&C server were hex-encoded and encrypted.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the data sent to the C&C server, including file paths, were hex-encoded and encrypted. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
