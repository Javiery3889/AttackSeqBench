Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: APT15 compromised over 30 hosts from May 2016 to late 2017, gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. **Execution**: Deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
3. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the network.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
5. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
6. **Collection**: Used various tools to extract data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, APT15 is likely to use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and then deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS).
- The stolen VPN certificate is mentioned as a method to access the network remotely, but it is not explicitly stated that APT15 used it before deploying the backdoors.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. **Execution**: Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) after gaining domain administrator credentials.
3. **Remote Access**: The stolen VPN certificate is a method to access the network remotely, but it is not mentioned as a step before deploying the backdoors.

Given the sequence in the CTI outline, the backdoors were deployed after gaining domain administrator credentials, and the stolen VPN certificate is a method for remote access, not necessarily a step before deploying the backdoors.

### Final Answer: B: No
