### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (SharpHound and PowerSploit) to perform reconnaissance by loading them directly into memory.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** Executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** Utilized web shells and a custom malware framework that operates in-memory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Employed various techniques, including custom versions of local privilege escalation tools.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** Established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, it is likely that the threat actor would utilize exploits to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement before establishing command and control with an inline hook.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline indicates that TG1021 initially gained access by exploiting IIS servers using deserialization attacks. This suggests that the threat actor already has a method to compromise IIS servers.
   - The reconnaissance phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit is a common practice to gather information about the network and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - Given the threat actor's sophistication and the use of in-memory malware, it is plausible that they would attempt to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement to expand their foothold within the network.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that the threat actor did not attempt to compromise additional servers, but the context of the attack suggests a thorough and methodical approach.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
