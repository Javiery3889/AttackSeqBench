### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** The group exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - **Execution:** Used `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created registry Run key entries and installed the backdoor as a service.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Not detailed in the report.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode and adjusted token privileges.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after dumping credentials, FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types during the Discovery phase before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a Discovery phase or the collection of system information before reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
   - However, it is common for cyberespionage groups to gather as much information as possible about the target environment before exfiltrating data. This includes system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.
   - The CTI report focuses on the exploitation of vulnerabilities, persistence, and data exfiltration, but it is reasonable to infer that the group would perform a discovery phase to understand the environment better.

### Final Answer:
Given the common practices of cyberespionage groups and the context provided in the CTI report, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would collect system information during a Discovery phase before reading file contents and exfiltrating them.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
