### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used various methods including SSH, RDP, and VPNs.
   - **Persistence:** They used credential hopping, WMI persistence with TrailBlazer, and created O365 Service Principals.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They stole browser cookies to bypass MFA and used renamed utilities.
   - **Discovery:** They used AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools to gather information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
   - **Collection:** They accessed data from information repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using credential hopping and configuring TrailBlazer for WMI persistence, the threat actor will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations and use them in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the threat actor used stolen browser cookies to bypass MFA. This indicates that they have a history of stealing and using cookies for authentication purposes.
   - The question specifically asks about stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations and using them in credential access techniques to access cloud resources. This aligns with the defense evasion techniques mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
The threat actor's history of stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA and their persistence techniques suggest that they would likely steal web session cookies from end-user workstations and use them in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
