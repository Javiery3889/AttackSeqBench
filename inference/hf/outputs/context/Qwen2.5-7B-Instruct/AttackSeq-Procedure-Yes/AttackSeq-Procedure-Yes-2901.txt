Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
2. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
5. **Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
6. **Collection**: APT15 used various tools to collect data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS after using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and steal a VPN certificate for remote network access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Backdoor Deployment**: The CTI outline clearly states that APT15 deployed BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS as part of their attack sequence.
- **Mimikatz and Credentials**: The CTI outline also mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
- **RoyalCLI**: The CTI outline specifically notes that RoyalCLI evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution Sequence**: The CTI outline indicates that APT15 deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) as part of their attack.
2. **Credential Access**: The CTI outline also mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
3. **RoyalCLI**: The CTI outline explicitly states that RoyalCLI is used to bypass command prompt policy settings, which aligns with the question's scenario.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is highly plausible that APT15 deployed the backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) after using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and steal a VPN certificate for remote network access, and that RoyalCLI was used to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
