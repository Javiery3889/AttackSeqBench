Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious `.lnk` files containing embedded HTA scripts.
- **Execution**: The HTA files executed various operations, including dropping Cobalt Strike Stagers and opening decoy documents.
- **Defense Evasion**: They used the double extension trick (e.g., `sample.doc.lnk`) to deceive users and employed Cobalt Strike and PlugX payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Mustang Panda is likely to utilize documents attempting to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses after using the double extension trick.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The use of the double extension trick is a method to bypass user and system defenses.
- **Execution**: Cobalt Strike Stagers are typically used to establish a foothold and communicate with the C2 server.
- **Defense Evasion**: The use of Cobalt Strike and PlugX suggests that the attackers are likely to use C2 communication to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The CTI outline mentions the use of Cobalt Strike Stagers, which are known to establish a connection to a C2 server.
  - Cobalt Strike is a powerful post-exploitation framework that is often used to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data, which involves C2 communication.
  - The use of the double extension trick is a method to evade detection, but it does not preclude the use of C2 communication for further operations.
  - Given the nature of Cobalt Strike and the objectives of the attackers (as mentioned in the "Others" section), it is highly likely that they would use C2 communication to maintain their operations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
