### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The malicious XLS attachment contained a VB macro that created a Windows Installer object to download a malicious MSI package.
   - **Persistence:** The MSI package installed legitimate Lua dependencies, a modified Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script named SunSeed, and established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup after the execution phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that the MSI package installed a malicious Lua script named SunSeed and established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - This directly aligns with the question's assertion that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed information provided in the CTI outline, the correct answer is that the MSI package will indeed achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
