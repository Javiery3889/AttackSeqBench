### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document with a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
   - **Execution:** The document silently executes a PE file (educrety.exe) without user interaction.
   - **Credential Access:** The PE file searches for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials are sent to a command and control server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is encrypted and exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any file deletion activities (T1107) as part of the attack sequence.
   - The attack sequence described focuses on initial access, execution, credential access, data collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - There is no indication of any defense evasion techniques, such as file deletion, in the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the campaign would employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
