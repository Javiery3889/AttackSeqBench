Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI outline describes a series of TTPs, starting with reconnaissance and moving through various stages of the attack.
   - Key points include:
     - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods.
     - **Initial Access:** Adversaries deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) via a phishing campaign and install BlackEnergy 3 on targeted workstations.
     - **Command and Control:** The outline explicitly states that the malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled Command-and-Control (CC) server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after reconnaissance and initial access, the malware will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the malware (BlackEnergy 3) establishes a connection to an external server via HTTP requests as part of its execution routine.
   - This connection is established after the malware is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, which is part of the initial access phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes

The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the malware (BlackEnergy 3) establishes a connection to an external Command-and-Control server, confirming that the malware will indeed establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
