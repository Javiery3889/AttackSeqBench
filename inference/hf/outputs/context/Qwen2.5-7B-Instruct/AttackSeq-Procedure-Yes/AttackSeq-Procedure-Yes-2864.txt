Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The malicious version of CCleaner was distributed through compromised download servers of Avast.
2. **Execution**: The malicious 32-bit CCleaner binary was modified to execute malicious code, decrypt the multi-stage payload, and initiate the infection process.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware payload attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature. It also created a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to deallocate memory and exit the thread.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the malware would establish a Command and Control (C2) channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests after the execution phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the establishment of a C2 channel or any specific communication methods.
- The focus of the CTI outline is on the initial compromise, execution of the payload, and evasion techniques.
- The question is asking about a specific TTP (C2 channel establishment) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware establishing a C2 channel or using HTTPS POST requests.
- The question is asking about a specific TTP that is not covered in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, we cannot definitively say whether the malware established a C2 channel or not based on the CTI outline.

However, since the CTI outline does not provide any information to support the establishment of a C2 channel, and the question is asking about a specific TTP that is not mentioned, the most plausible answer is that the malware did not establish a C2 channel in the manner described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
