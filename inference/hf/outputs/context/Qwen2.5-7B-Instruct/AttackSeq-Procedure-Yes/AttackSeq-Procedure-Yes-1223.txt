### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen valid user credentials to gain access through Citrix and LogMeIn.
   - **Execution:** Deployed Trochilus malware with encrypted C2 communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Utilized DLL sideloading to execute a legitimate binary and load a renamed malicious DLL.
   - **Credential Access:** Used Mimikatz to steal credentials and accessed the domain controller.
   - **Collection:** Compressed and exfiltrated data using WinRAR and cURL.
   - **Command and Control:** Used Trochilus with encrypted C2 communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Employed custom malware with Dropbox for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement after deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Citrix servers for lateral movement or the timing of logins.
   - The initial access was through stolen credentials, but the question specifically asks about using Citrix servers and the timing of logins.
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the timing of logins or the use of Citrix servers for lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of Citrix servers for lateral movement or the timing of logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: No**
