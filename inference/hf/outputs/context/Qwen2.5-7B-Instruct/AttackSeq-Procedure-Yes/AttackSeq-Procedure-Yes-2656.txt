Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Resource Development**: The malware is a new Korplug variant named Hodur, used by Mustang Panda.
- **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
- **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
- **Persistence**: The malware establishes persistence by creating hidden and system directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and hidden directories.
- **Discovery**: The malware collects system information and IP addresses.
- **Command and Control**: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, which is encrypted using RC4.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol, involving TCP messages with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question mentions data collection from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention data collection from network shared drives, but it does mention data collection from the system and IP addresses.
- The CTI outline clearly states that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, which is encrypted using RC4.
- The CTI outline also mentions that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: The malware collects metadata and content from local systems and removable media, as well as system information and IP addresses.
2. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, which is encrypted using RC4.
3. **Data Exfiltration**: The CTI outline explicitly states that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

Given the information provided, the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after collecting data from network shared drives, as it is consistent with the described TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
