Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
2. **Exfiltration**: The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance, it is likely to have communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance and then exfiltrated data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
- The question specifically asks about the communication method after the initial reconnaissance phase, which aligns with the exfiltration phase described in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Rising Sun implant first performed reconnaissance to gather network and system information.
2. After gathering this information, the implant encrypted and exfiltrated the data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
3. The question asks if the implant communicated with the control server via HTTP POST requests after the reconnaissance phase, which is directly supported by the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
