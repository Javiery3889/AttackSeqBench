### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The 'grc.dll' plugin is used to create a backup communication channel via Google Plus.
     - The 'usb.dll' plugin collects information on USB drives and may implement BadUSB-related techniques.
     - The 'bs.dll' plugin gathers system information using WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls.
     - The 'dstr.dll' plugin is designed to overwrite data on hard drives, with both user-mode and kernel-mode functionality, including an embedded win32 library and win64 driver modules.
   - **Impact:**
     - The 'dstr.dll' plugin is used for data destruction, specifically overwriting data on hard drives to disrupt availability or compromise integrity.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlackEnergy2 is likely to use the 'bs.dll' plugin for collecting detailed system information before using the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite hard drive data.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. 'grc.dll' for creating a backup communication channel.
     2. 'usb.dll' for collecting USB drive information.
     3. 'bs.dll' for collecting detailed system information.
     4. 'dstr.dll' for overwriting hard drive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the 'bs.dll' plugin is used for collecting detailed system information.
   - The 'dstr.dll' plugin is used for overwriting data on hard drives.
   - The sequence in the question aligns with the order of operations described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs in the question matches the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Yes, BlackEnergy2 is likely to utilize the 'bs.dll' plugin for collecting detailed system information before employing the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite hard drive data in acts of sabotage.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
