Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The MuddyWater campaign uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro that executes PowerShell scripts.
   - **Execution:** The Document_Open() event triggers the execution of the malicious routine, involving the use of three main functions: one to execute sub-functions, another to manipulate images, and a third to construct and execute the main PowerShell commands and scripts.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerShell script decodes the contents of the malicious document and executes another encoded PowerShell script, which drops various components into the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory. The main PowerShell file, invoker.ps1, uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.
   - **Command and Control:** The PRB-Backdoor communicates with a C&C server to perform various actions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access and executing the malicious scripts, the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the PowerShell script decodes the contents of the malicious document and executes another encoded PowerShell script, which drops various components into a specific directory.
   - The outline also mentions that the main PowerShell file, invoker.ps1, uses these components to run the final payload.
   - This sequence aligns with the question's description of using decoded scripts to drop components for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the detailed sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, the campaign indeed uses decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Yes".

Final Answer: A: Yes
