Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection.
2. **Execution**: Deployed custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function.
4. **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts.
5. **Command and Control**: Communicated with C2 servers over HTTP using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
6. **Impact**: Deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after exploiting public-facing applications for initial access and uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP, it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, for execution before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications.
- **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts.
- **Execution**: Deployed custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
- **Persistence**: Registered the 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
- **Webshells on Compromised Systems**: Deployed webshells on compromised systems.

The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI outline. Agrius first gains initial access, then uses webshells for lateral movement, and subsequently deploys custom malware (the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor) for execution, which then achieves persistence by registering as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius gains entry through exploiting public-facing applications.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Uses webshells to move laterally within the network.
3. **Execution**: Deploys the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution.
4. **Persistence**: Registers the 'IPsec Helper' as a service to ensure long-term access.
5. **Webshells on Compromised Systems**: Deploys additional webshells on compromised systems.

Given this sequence, the answer is clearly affirmative.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
