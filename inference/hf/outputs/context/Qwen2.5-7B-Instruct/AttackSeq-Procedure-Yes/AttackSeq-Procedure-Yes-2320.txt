### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Shamoon malware was deployed and executed as a scheduled job.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes a copy of itself, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver for disk access.
   - **Persistence:** The malware entrenches itself as a service.
   - **Command and Control:** Fidelis researchers have developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware.
   - **Impact:** The malware overwrites data on disks, targeting user data first, then system data, and eventually overwriting the disk's boot records.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware will overwrite the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic after executing a copy of itself and dropping a driver for disk access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that Shamoon malware overwrites the disk's boot records as part of its impact. This is a critical piece of information.
   - The question does not mention Defense Evasion as a tactic, but rather asks about the impact of overwriting the VBR.
   - The VBR is a part of the disk's boot records, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the CTI outline clearly states that Shamoon malware overwrites the disk's boot records, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would overwrite the VBR as part of its destructive operations.
   - The question does not introduce any new information that would contradict this, and the VBR is a component of the boot records.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A: Yes
