Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key points:
1. **Execution**: The execution of GOLDBACKDOOR involved a Windows shortcut file named 'Kang Min-chol Edits 2.lnk' that masqueraded as a document and executed a PowerShell script.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR was designed to avoid detection by antivirus or endpoint security, using a multi-stage process and obfuscation techniques.
3. **Command and Control**: GOLDBACKDOOR utilized cloud services for C2, including Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that after a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists, GOLDBACKDOOR will execute a Windows shortcut file masquerading as a document to run an obfuscated PowerShell script for deploying the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Spear-Phishing Campaign**: The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a spear-phishing campaign, but it does mention that the malware targeted journalists, which aligns with the context of a spear-phishing attack.
- **Windows Shortcut File**: The CTI outline clearly states that GOLDBACKDOOR involved a Windows shortcut file named 'Kang Min-chol Edits 2.lnk' that masqueraded as a document.
- **Obfuscated PowerShell Script**: The CTI outline mentions that the PowerShell script was obfuscated and used to deploy the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Spear-Phishing Campaign**: While not explicitly stated, the targeting of journalists suggests a spear-phishing campaign.
2. **Windows Shortcut File**: The CTI outline clearly describes the use of a Windows shortcut file as part of the initial infection vector.
3. **Obfuscated PowerShell Script**: The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of an obfuscated PowerShell script for deployment.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the sequence described in the question aligns perfectly with the attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
