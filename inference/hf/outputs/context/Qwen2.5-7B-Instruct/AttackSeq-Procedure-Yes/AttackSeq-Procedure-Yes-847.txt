### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact with the target.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing security measures.
   - **Credential Access:** Using valid credentials for access and movement.
   - **Discovery:** Locating systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Collecting relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishing communication channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after the discovery phase, attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The discovery phase (as described in the CTI outline) involves identifying systems, users, and data relevant to the mission.
   - The next logical step after discovery is to understand how to move laterally within the network and gain access to more systems. This is typically achieved through lateral movement, which can involve exploiting remote services.
   - After gaining access to new systems, the next step is often to establish persistence to ensure long-term access. This is described in the CTI outline under the persistence phase.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This aligns with the logical sequence of actions after discovery. After identifying relevant systems, users, and data, attackers would likely exploit remote services to move laterally and then install persistence points.
   - **B: No** - This does not align with the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack. It would be unusual to skip the lateral movement and persistence steps after discovery.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
