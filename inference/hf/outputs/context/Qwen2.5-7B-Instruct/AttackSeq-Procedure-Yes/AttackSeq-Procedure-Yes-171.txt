Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Malicious email with trojaned attachments.
2. **Execution**: 'Surtr' malware injects itself into a new explorer or iexplore process.
3. **Persistence**: Adds registry keys for persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Uses a known vulnerability and evades antivirus heuristics.
5. **Discovery**: Lists file directories and contents, creates folders for temporary information.
6. **Command and Control (C2) Interaction**: No explicit mention of connecting to a C2 server or downloading a stage two component.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if 'Surtr' will connect to a C2 server and download a stage two component after discovering file directories and creating folders for temporary information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention 'Surtr' connecting to a C2 server or downloading a stage two component after the discovery phase.
- The 'Others' section mentions that 'Surtr' can download additional components like 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0', but it does not specify that this happens immediately after the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence indicating that 'Surtr' connects to a C2 server and downloads a stage two component immediately after the discovery phase.
- The 'Others' section suggests that 'Surtr' can download additional components, but it does not specify the timing or the exact sequence of events.
- Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support the immediate connection to a C2 server and download of a stage two component after the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: B: No
