Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via a malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' containing macros that execute an executable.
2. **Execution**: The malware framework includes two downloaders: 'Downloader 1' and 'Downloader 2'.
3. **Persistence**: A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' establishes persistence for 'Setup.exe'.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses anti-sandbox detection and creates logs for debugging.
5. **Collection**: The malware is capable of file collection, keylogging, and taking screenshots. It includes specific plugins for these functions:
   - 'vstservice.exe' for document listing
   - 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging
   - 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots
6. **Command and Control**: The malware uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise its traffic, downloading a file from Google Docs to get its C2 host and sending beacon messages with system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the 'yty' framework exfiltrates gathered data (file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots) back to the C2 server using automated methods.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the 'yty' framework includes plugins for file collection, keylogging, and taking screenshots.
- It also mentions that the malware is capable of exfiltrating data, which aligns with the question's focus on exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via a malicious Excel document, which is a common initial access vector.
2. **Execution**: The malware framework includes downloaders that can execute additional components.
3. **Collection**: The malware includes specific plugins for collecting file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.
4. **Exfiltration**: The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware exfiltrates the collected data, but it is reasonable to infer that the framework, given its capabilities, would likely exfiltrate the collected data to the C2 server.

Given the context and the capabilities described in the CTI outline, it is highly plausible that the 'yty' framework would exfiltrate the gathered data back to the C2 server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
