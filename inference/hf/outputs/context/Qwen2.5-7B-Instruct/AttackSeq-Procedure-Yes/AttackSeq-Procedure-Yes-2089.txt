Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
2. **Execution**: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, and delete files.
3. **Persistence**: Established persistence using a backdoor from the C&C server.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Minimized detection by operating outside business hours and using single workstations.
5. **Credential Access**: Compromised Domain Administrator credentials.
6. **Discovery**: Used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the network, collecting administrative credentials.
7. **Lateral Movement**: Moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations.
8. **Collection**: Collected and prepared valuable documents for exfiltration.
9. **Command and Control**: Used Cobalt Strike for C&C communication.
10. **Exfiltration**: Prepared documents for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using domain administrative credentials to compromise additional endpoints through discovery, the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used the Domain Administrator credentials to compromise additional endpoints.
- The Discovery phase involved using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the network, collecting administrative credentials.
- The Lateral Movement phase involved moving laterally across the infrastructure, which would logically follow the discovery and use of administrative credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers initially compromised the Domain Administrator account.
2. They used this account to discover and map the network, collecting additional administrative credentials.
3. With these credentials, they could move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising additional endpoints.

Given this sequence, it is highly plausible that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
