Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Collection**: 
   - SunBird and Hornbill collect various types of data (SMS, encrypted messaging app content, geolocation, call logs, contacts, device metadata, images, WhatsApp voice notes, browser history, calendar information, etc.).
   - Data is stored in SQLite databases, compressed into ZIP files, and uploaded to C2 servers.
   - SunBird also uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals, while Hornbill uploads data only when it changes.

2. **Command and Control**:
   - SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals.
   - Hornbill uploads data to C2 servers only when data changes.
   - The C2 domains pieupdate[.]online and samaatv[.]online are associated with Confucius APT infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether SunBird and Hornbill will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels to their command and control servers after collecting and compressing the data into ZIP files and storing it in hidden folders on external storage.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **SunBird**: The CTI outline states that SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals. This implies that SunBird will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels.
- **Hornbill**: The CTI outline states that Hornbill uploads data to C2 servers only when data changes. This also implies that Hornbill will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels, but only when there is a change in the data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **SunBird**: Since SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals, it is likely to exfiltrate the data over C2 channels.
- **Hornbill**: Since Hornbill uploads data to C2 servers only when data changes, it is also likely to exfiltrate the data over C2 channels, but only when there is a change.

Both SunBird and Hornbill are designed to exfiltrate data over C2 channels, either at regular intervals or when data changes. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that both will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
