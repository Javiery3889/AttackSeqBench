### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
   - **Persistence:** Turla employs WMI event subscriptions and modifying the PowerShell profile to persist.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Turla uses encryption, obfuscation, and AMSI bypass techniques.
   - **Collection:** Turla's RPC backdoor and PowerStallion collect files from the local file system and USB drives.
   - **Command and Control:** RPC backdoor uses RPC protocol, while PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB.
   - **Exfiltration:** PowerStallion exfiltrates data through OneDrive, encrypting results with XOR key 0xAA.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Turla's RPC backdoor will perform lateral movement to facilitate file and directory discovery before using plugins to gather file and directory information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention lateral movement or file and directory discovery as a separate step. However, the collection phase involves gathering recent files from the local file system and USB drives.
   - The question implies a sequence where lateral movement occurs before file and directory information is gathered, which is not directly supported by the provided CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided, there is no explicit mention of lateral movement as a separate step in the attack sequence. The collection phase directly involves gathering files and directory information without an intermediate step of lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include lateral movement before file and directory discovery.

**Final Answer: B: No**
