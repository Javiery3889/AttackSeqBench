### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary obtained SSH access and used `wget` to download malware.
   - **Execution:** The custom loader runs Derusbi, which drops and loads a Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) into the kernel.
   - **Persistence:** The Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Turbo LKM modifies the system's global call table and disables write protection to modify the system call table, evading detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware binds to a raw socket and communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Derusbi will gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Derusbi gathering system information before initiating C2 communication. However, it is a common practice for malware to gather system information (e.g., IP address, hostname, OS version) to tailor its behavior and evade detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline suggests a methodical approach to establishing persistence and evading detection, which often includes gathering system information to better understand the environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common practice of malware gathering system information before establishing C2 communication, and the detailed steps taken to evade detection, it is plausible that Derusbi would gather system information before initiating C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
