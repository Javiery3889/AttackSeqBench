### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Execution:** Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor copies itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creates a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user and executes another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server uncompressed and supports sending information about current sessions.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the deployment of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit or any specific use of DKOM.
   - The attack sequence described focuses on persistence, privilege escalation, and various forms of data collection and exfiltration.
   - The Fire Chili rootkit is mentioned in the "Others" section as a tool used by Deep Panda and Winnti, but there is no indication that it is used in the specific attack sequence described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that Deep Panda deploys the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
