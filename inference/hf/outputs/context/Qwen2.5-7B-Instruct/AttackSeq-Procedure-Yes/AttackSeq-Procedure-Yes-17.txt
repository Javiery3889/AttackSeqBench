### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - **Collection:** "Machete" is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing audio from the computer's microphone, taking screenshots, capturing geolocation data, taking photos from the computer's web camera, copying files to a remote server, copying files to a special USB device if inserted, and hijacking the clipboard to capture information from the target machine.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if "Machete" will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that "Machete" is capable of performing these actions (logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard) as part of its collection capabilities.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the collection capabilities described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, "Machete" is indeed capable of performing the actions mentioned in the question after establishing persistence. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
