Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites.
   - **Initial Access:** Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Elfin uses a variety of tools, including custom malware and commodity malware.
   - **Persistence:** Elfin creates scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Elfin uses PowerShell commands to bypass logging and deploys various tools for defense evasion.
   - **Command and Control:** Elfin uses POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Elfin exfiltrates data using custom tools.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if Elfin will likely bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands, then proceed with command and control communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT after extracting credentials.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Bypassing Logging:** The CTI outline mentions that Elfin uses PowerShell commands to bypass logging as part of their defense evasion tactics.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Elfin using a specific credential dumping tool before deploying DarkComet. However, it is common for APTs to perform credential dumping as part of their attack sequence.
   - **Command and Control:** The CTI outline clearly states that Elfin uses POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for C&C communications.

Given the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that Elfin would likely follow a sequence where they first bypass logging, then extract credentials, and finally use C&C tools for further control.

**Final Answer: Yes (A)**
