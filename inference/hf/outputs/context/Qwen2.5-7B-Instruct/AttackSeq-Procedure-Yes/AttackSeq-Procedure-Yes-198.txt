### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that FamousSparrow exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to gain Initial Access.
   - **Execution:** They used `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They employed various tactics such as injecting encrypted shellcode into processes and adjusting token privileges.
   - **Collection:** They collected system information and exfiltrated data.
   - **Command and Control:** They communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex after exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access and executing SparrowDoor through `cmd.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any Persistence techniques such as creating a registry Run key entry or installing SparrowDoor as a service.
   - The outline focuses on the exploitation of vulnerabilities, execution of SparrowDoor, and other tactics like Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - While Persistence is a common tactic in cyber attacks, the specific methods mentioned in the question (creating a registry Run key entry and installing as a service) are not detailed in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of Persistence techniques such as creating a registry Run key entry or installing SparrowDoor as a service. Therefore, it is unlikely that these specific Persistence methods were used.

**Final Answer: B: No**
