Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. **Collection**: The backdoor collects a wide range of data.
7. **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated over the C&C channel.
8. **Impact**: The backdoor can shut down the victim's computer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gathering detailed information about the victim's computer, the backdoor will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor installed by the attackers had the capability to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
- The outline also states that the backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.
- However, the outline does not explicitly mention whether the communication with the C&C server is encrypted or not.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Data Collection**: The backdoor collects detailed information about the victim's computer.
2. **Communication with C&C Server**: The backdoor communicates with the C&C server to send the collected data.
3. **Encryption**: The question specifically asks if the communication is encrypted. The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the encryption of the communication channel.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the communication with the C&C server being encrypted. Therefore, based on the available details, it is not certain that the communication is encrypted.

Final Answer: B: No
