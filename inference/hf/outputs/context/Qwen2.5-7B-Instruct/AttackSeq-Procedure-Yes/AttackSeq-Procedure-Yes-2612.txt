Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers use mobile applications loaded with spyware to entice victims. These applications include ISIS branded wallpaper changer, ANF Kurdistan news agency updates, and a fake Vidogram app.
- **Collection**: The malware embedded in these applications collects a wide range of data from the victims' devices, including contact lists, phone call records, SMS messages, browser history, geo-location, photos, and surrounding voice recordings. This data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the stolen data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests. HTTP is an application layer protocol.
- The question is asking about the Command and Control phase, which aligns with the data transmission phase described in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the stolen data is sent to the C&C servers using HTTP POST requests, which is an application layer protocol.
- The question is asking if it is likely that the stolen data is sent over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase, which is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Given this analysis, the most plausible answer is that the stolen data is indeed sent over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
