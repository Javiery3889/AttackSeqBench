### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (e.g., SharpHound, PowerSploit) to perform reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** Executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware (NodeIISWeb).
   - **Persistence:** Utilized web shells and a custom malware framework that operates in-memory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used custom versions of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded commercial EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** Modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Used SharpHound and PowerSploit to scan and map targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, allowing NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory. This indicates that the malware is designed to run in memory and interact with the IIS request handling process.
   - The outline also states that TG1021 actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them, which suggests a focus on maintaining stealth and avoiding detection.
   - The question asks about deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, which aligns with the use of NodeIISWeb as a memory-resident malware that intercepts and handles HTTP requests.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context that NodeIISWeb operates in-memory and intercepts HTTP requests, it is plausible that TG1021 would deploy an inline hook to provide backdoor functionality. This aligns with the malware's design and the need for stealth.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
