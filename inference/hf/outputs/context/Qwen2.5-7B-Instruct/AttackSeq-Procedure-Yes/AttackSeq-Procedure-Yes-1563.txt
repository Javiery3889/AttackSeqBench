Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline describes a sophisticated supply-chain attack where SolarWinds was compromised, and a custom backdoor named Sunburst was deployed. This initial access allowed for further exploitation.
- **Further Exploitation**: The outline does not explicitly mention the communication protocol used by the Sunburst backdoor for further exploitation. However, it does indicate that the attackers used this initial access to deploy malware and conduct further operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation after the initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not provide specific information about the communication protocol used by the Sunburst backdoor. However, it is common for backdoors to communicate with their C2 servers using various protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.) to facilitate further exploitation.
- The question is asking about a likely scenario based on typical behavior of backdoors and the context provided in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The CTI outline confirms that SolarWinds was compromised and Sunburst was deployed, which indicates initial access.
  - While the outline does not explicitly state the communication protocol, it is a standard practice for backdoors to communicate with C2 servers to carry out further actions.
  - The context of further exploitation suggests that the backdoor would need to communicate with a C2 server to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.

- **Final Answer**:
  - Given the typical behavior of backdoors and the context of further exploitation, it is highly likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A: Yes
