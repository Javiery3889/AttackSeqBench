### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
   - **Execution:** CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and system information.
   - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Command and Control:** CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP and FTP.
   - **Exfiltration:** CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files after discovering files on hard drives and network drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention searching removable drives for files. The discovery process described focuses on specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - The question is asking about a specific technique (Data from Removable Media) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence that CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke does not search removable drives for files after discovering files on hard drives and network drives.

**Final Answer: B: No**
