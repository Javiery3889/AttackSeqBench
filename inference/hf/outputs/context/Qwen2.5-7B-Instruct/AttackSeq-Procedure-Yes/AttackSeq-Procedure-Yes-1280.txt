Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper uses Tropic Trooper (KeyBoy) to execute commands through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are security flaws in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). They download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use SSL to connect to C&C servers.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory and creates one hidden directory (UFile) into C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\, likely as a ruse. The loader, named FakeRun, executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL file, which is the backdoor.
4. **Command and Control**: TClient uses SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server. The C&C server and some configuration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor, allowing Tropic Trooper's operators to easily change/update the C&C server and configure other values.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the C&C servers via SSL.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package.
- **Persistence**: The backdoor decrypts its configuration file and connects to the C&C server via SSL.
- **Defense Evasion**: The installer drops files and creates a hidden directory, and the loader (FakeRun) executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL file.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor connects to the C&C server.

The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline is:
1. Exploit Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
2. Download and install an MSI package.
3. The installer drops files and creates a hidden directory.
4. The loader (FakeRun) executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL file.
5. The backdoor decrypts its configuration file and connects to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.
- From the CTI outline, the dropper (malicious DLL file) is injected into dllhost.exe after the installer has dropped the necessary files and created the hidden directory.
- The backdoor then decrypts its configuration file and connects to the C&C server, which is a later step in the sequence.

Given this sequence, the dropper (malicious documents) is executed after the initial access and before the backdoor establishes persistence. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
