Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for process discovery, system information, and system time discovery.
   - **Collection:** Archiving of collected data.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 traffic.
   - The question directly aligns with this information, asking about the likelihood of data exfiltration over the C2 channel using the same methods.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor would exfiltrate data over the C2 channel using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges, as these methods are explicitly mentioned in the outline.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
