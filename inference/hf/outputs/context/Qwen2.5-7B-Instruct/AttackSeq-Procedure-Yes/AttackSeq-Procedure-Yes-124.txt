### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection.
   - **Execution:** Deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
   - **Persistence:** Achieved persistence through webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used webshells with obfuscation and the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' to update itself and delete traces.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, performing actions like updating relays and downloading files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for C2 communication and other actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of wipers or ransomware. The focus is on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - The question introduces a new element (wipers and ransomware) that is not directly supported by the CTI outline. The CTI outline does not provide any information about the deployment of destructive malware like wipers or ransomware.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence or indication that Agrius deployed wipers or ransomware like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for C2 communication and other actions. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
