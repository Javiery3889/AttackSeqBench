Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign used malicious documents to gather information.
2. **Initial Access**: A malicious macro in a Word document injects the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
3. **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
4. **Discovery**: The Rising Sun implant performs reconnaissance and gathers system information.
5. **Command and Control**: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers.
6. **Exfiltration**: The Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, after initial access is achieved by injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word, which then retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
- This indicates that the Sharpshooter downloader is indeed a downloader for the Rising Sun implant, which is the second-stage payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word, which is the initial access.
- The Sharpshooter downloader then retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
- The Rising Sun implant acts as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, as it is designed to perform various functions and maintain persistence.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
