Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script would communicate with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads would include GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the phishing emails contained malicious Word documents with embedded macros.
- The execution sequence involves the VBS macro executing upon opening the Word document, which then runs an encoded PowerShell script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The campaign uses phishing emails to gain initial access to the target system.
2. **Execution of Macros**: The malicious Word document contains a VBS macro that is designed to execute upon opening the document.
3. **Subsequent Actions**: The VBS macro then calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.

Given the detailed sequence of events in the CTI outline, it is clear that the VBS macro is a critical part of the execution process after the initial access through the phishing email.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
