Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Using trojanized installation files of well-known applications.
2. **Execution**: Deploying the malware using trojanized installers and reconfiguring Windows Defender.
3. **Persistence**: Creating a service to launch the C2 contact module upon startup.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Performing checks for specific antivirus software and adding exclusions to Windows Defender.
5. **Collection**: Searching for and exfiltrating Microsoft Office files.
6. **Command and Control**: Using hardcoded C2 domains and communicating over HTTPS with self-signed certificates.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Collection phase, specifically whether the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline does not explicitly mention encoding the archives with an unusual scheme or splitting them into chunks. The Collection phase only states that the malware searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives and exfiltrates them to the C2 server. There is no information provided about encoding or splitting the archives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about encoding or splitting the archives after the Collection phase.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltration.
- Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no basis to conclude that the malware performs these additional actions.

### Final Answer: B: No
