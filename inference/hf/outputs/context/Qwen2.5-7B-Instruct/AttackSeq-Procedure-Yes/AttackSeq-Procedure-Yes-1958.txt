Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the StellarParticle campaign used SSH to log into a public-facing system with stolen credentials and also used port forwarding to establish RDP sessions with different domain accounts.
   - They also used VPNs to gain access and persist in the environment.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The outline states that the threat actor stole browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) and used renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
   - They also renamed their systems to match the victim's naming convention before connecting to the victim's VPNs.

3. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will configure TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence and GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry before conducting defense evasion by stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA).

4. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence or GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
   - The outline does mention defense evasion techniques such as stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA, which aligns with the question.
   - However, the specific malware configurations (TrailBlazer for WMI and GoldMax for crontab) are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of TrailBlazer for WMI persistence and GoldMax for crontab persistence. The outline focuses more on initial access, persistence via SSH and RDP, and defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: No**
