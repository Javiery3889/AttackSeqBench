### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The document exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used several evasion techniques, including file deletion, hidden files and directories, and software packing.
   - **Credential Access:** The PE file (educrety.exe) searched for stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor will proceed to collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the PE file (educrety.exe) searched for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys, which aligns with the Credential Access phase (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - The defense evasion techniques mentioned (T1107, T1158, T1045) are consistent with the actions described in the CTI outline, such as deleting the original file and hiding files and directories.
   - The sequence of events in the CTI outline supports the idea that after silent code execution, the malware would proceed to collect data and then employ defense evasion techniques.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed attack sequence described in the CTI outline and the alignment with the TTPs mentioned, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the threat actor would indeed proceed to collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
