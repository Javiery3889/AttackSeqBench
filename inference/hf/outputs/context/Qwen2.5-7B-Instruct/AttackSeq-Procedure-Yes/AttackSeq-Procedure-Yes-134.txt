Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
2. **Defense Evasion**: APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection by security software and firewall interception, including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Not directly relevant to the sequence in question.
4. **Command and Control**: Not directly relevant to the sequence in question.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gaining initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts, the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory without being written to the hard disk, and if multi-beacon communication was used for defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
- **Defense Evasion**: The outline explicitly mentions that APT-TOCS runs in memory and does not write to the hard disk, which aligns with the question's first part.
- **Multi-Beacon Communication**: The outline states that APT-TOCS uses multi-beacon communication to evade sandbox detection, which aligns with the question's second part.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The CTI outline clearly states that APT-TOCS runs in memory and does not write to the hard disk, which directly supports the first part of the question.
2. The outline also mentions that APT-TOCS uses multi-beacon communication to evade detection, which directly supports the second part of the question.
3. Both parts of the question are supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
