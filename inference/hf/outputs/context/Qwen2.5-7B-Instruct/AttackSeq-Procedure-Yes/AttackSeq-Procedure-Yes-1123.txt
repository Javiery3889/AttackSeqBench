### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The APT group uses DLL side-loading to execute a malicious payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group uses a clean loader (e.g., renamed Microsoft antivirus component or DISM.EXE) to load a malicious DLL that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload. The payloads are encrypted using a simple XOR algorithm.
   - **Exfiltration:** The group configures the system for data exfiltration by creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder and copying files to this folder.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using DLL side-loading to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload for defense evasion, the attack's final payload will establish a remote command shell and connect back to the command and control server at IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999 for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the establishment of a remote command shell or the connection to a command and control server.
   - The focus of the CTI outline is on the methods used for execution, defense evasion, and exfiltration. There is no information provided about the final payload's behavior or the establishment of a remote command shell.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the establishment of a remote command shell or the connection to a command and control server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attack's final payload does not establish a remote command shell before connecting back to the command and control server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
