### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing with links to compressed files or zipped files containing malicious content.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files/directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Targeting key and certificate files for credential exfiltration.
   - **Discovery:** Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, and enumerating running processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, and capturing screenshots.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C&C, with scheduled transfers every 10 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic after collecting data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C&C servers. However, it does mention that data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C, and scheduled transfers are set up to send data every 10 minutes.
   - The fallback channels for network traffic are not mentioned in the CTI outline, but the question is asking about a scenario where standard ports are used before fallback channels are implemented.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence that Machete uses standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers. The outline focuses on the specific methods and channels used for data exfiltration and does not mention the use of standard ports or fallback channels.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Machete does not use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers before implementing fallback channels.

**Final Answer: B: No**
