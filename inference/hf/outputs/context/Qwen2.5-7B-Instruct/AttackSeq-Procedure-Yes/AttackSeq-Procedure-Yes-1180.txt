Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a cyber attack that involves several MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use malicious documents with macros to deliver payloads.
2. **Execution**: The payload creates files in the ProgramData directory and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script.
3. **Persistence**: The VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The script uses obfuscation and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
5. **Discovery**: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
6. **Collection**: The backdoor function also collects machine information and takes screenshots.
7. **Command and Control (C&C)**: The backdoor sends collected data to a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server.
- However, the backdoor function is described as collecting and sending data to a C&C server, which is a typical Command and Control phase activity.
- The outline does not provide any information about the encryption of the communication channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the backdoor's functionality and the data it collects and sends to the C&C server.
- There is no explicit mention of encryption in the communication with the C&C server.
- Without additional information, we cannot assume that the communication is encrypted.

Given the lack of explicit information about encryption in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the communication is not necessarily encrypted.

**Final Answer: B: No**
