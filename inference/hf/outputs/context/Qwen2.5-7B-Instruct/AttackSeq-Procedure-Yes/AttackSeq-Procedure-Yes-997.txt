Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Phishing email with a link to a SharePoint URL that downloads a ZIP file containing a VBS script, which drops a JavaScript backdoor.
2. **Execution**: Deployment of a JavaScript backdoor, installation of CARBANAK RAT on domain controllers, and execution of an obfuscated script through reflection methods.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Use of RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT, which connects to a different domain.
4. **Discovery**: Deployment of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
5. **Collection**: Exfiltration of data using SmartFTP Client.
6. **Command and Control**: CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT communicating with their respective C2 servers.
7. **Exfiltration**: Data theft using SmartFTP Client.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that RYUK ransomware would be deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, which included remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec during the Impact phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any ransomware deployment, including RYUK.
- The outline describes a typical APT lifecycle with initial access, execution, privilege escalation, discovery, and data collection, but does not include any ransomware deployment.
- The question introduces a new phase (Impact) and a specific ransomware (RYUK) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the initial compromise, privilege escalation, data collection, and exfiltration.
- There is no information about ransomware deployment or the Impact phase.
- The question introduces a new phase and a specific ransomware that is not aligned with the CTI outline.

Given the lack of any information about ransomware deployment in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that RYUK ransomware would not be deployed in the scenario described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
