Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The outline describes the use of spear-phishing emails and custom-built backdoors/RATs like CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog.
   - **Resource Development:** The groups use similar tools and techniques, including custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails are the primary attack vector.
   - **Execution:** Evasion techniques include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents. The CT/NewCT payload uses a 'CPU core check' to avoid detection in virtualized environments.
   - **Persistence:** The CT/NewCT implant creates a registry entry file called 'Windows.reg' and imports its contents into the registry to ensure startup persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The groups use various evasion techniques, including environment-based evasion and large null-padded files to evade detection by AV engines.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Moafee and DragonOK will use the NewCT RAT to emit a network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data during command and control operations after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a network beacon or the NewCT RAT emitting such a beacon. However, it does describe the use of the CT/NewCT implant for persistence and other evasion techniques.
   - The question is asking about a specific TTP (network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the methods used for initial access, persistence, and evasion. It does not provide information about the specific TTP of emitting a network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data.
   - Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support the use of a network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data by the NewCT RAT.

**Final Answer: No**
