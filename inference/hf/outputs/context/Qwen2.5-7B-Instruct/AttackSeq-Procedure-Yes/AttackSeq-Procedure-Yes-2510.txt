Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use two vectors: compromising a public-facing web service and spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Post-Exploitation:** After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, the attackers map the network and collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - **Tools Used:** Nmap and Mimikatz are mentioned as standard tools for network mapping and credential collection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the GreyEnergy group is likely to use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement after compromising a computer and collecting credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - The outline does mention the use of Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.
   - PsExec and WinExe are tools used for remote execution and are often used for lateral movement in post-exploitation scenarios. However, the CTI outline does not provide any direct evidence that the GreyEnergy group uses these specific tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the initial infection vectors and the tools used for network mapping and credential collection.
   - While it is common for threat actors to use a variety of tools for lateral movement, the specific mention of PsExec and WinExe is not present in the provided CTI outline.
   - The outline does not provide any context that would suggest the use of these particular tools.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the GreyEnergy group is not likely to use these specific tools for lateral movement based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
