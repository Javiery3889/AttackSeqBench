Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers modified the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file hosted on the CDN to load additional malicious code from the IP address `176.58.101.24`.
- **Context**: The threat actors involved in the Afghan Government compromise used IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation, indicating a targeted approach.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- **Sequence of TTPs**: The question asks if the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Attack Sequence from CTI Outline**: The outline describes the attackers modifying the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file to load additional malicious code. However, it does not mention any obfuscation or encoding techniques.
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: Yes** - This would imply that the attackers used obfuscation and encoding techniques, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
  - **B: No** - This would imply that the attackers did not use obfuscation and encoding techniques, which is more consistent with the information provided.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the attackers using obfuscation or encoding techniques. The focus is on the modification of the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file to load additional malicious code.
- Given the lack of information about obfuscation and encoding, and the targeted nature of the attack (as indicated by the use of IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation), it is more plausible that the attackers did not use these additional techniques.

### Final Answer: B: No
