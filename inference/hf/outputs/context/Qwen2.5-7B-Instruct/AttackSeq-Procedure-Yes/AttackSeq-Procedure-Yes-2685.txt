Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets or create C&C infrastructure.
2. **Execution**: Elfin has deployed a wide range of tools, including custom malware and commodity malware.
3. **Persistence**: Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file for persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging and deployed various tools for defense evasion.
5. **Credential Access**: Elfin used DarkComet for credential dumping.
6. **Command and Control**: Elfin used POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools for C&C.
7. **Exfiltration**: Elfin exfiltrated data using custom .NET and AutoIt FTP tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Elfin would exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails before deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of CVE-2018-20250 or spear-phishing emails as part of their attack sequence.
- The outline does mention the use of various tools for execution, such as Notestuk and Stonedrill, but does not specify the initial exploitation vector.
- The reconnaissance phase involves scanning for vulnerable websites, but the question asks about a specific exploit (CVE-2018-20250) and a specific delivery method (spear-phishing emails).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of Elfin using CVE-2018-20250 or spear-phishing emails.
- The execution phase mentions the use of various tools, but does not specify the initial exploitation vector.
- Given the lack of specific information about the initial exploitation vector in the CTI outline, it is not possible to definitively state that Elfin used CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails.

### Final Answer: No
The CTI outline does not provide sufficient evidence to support the use of CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails as part of Elfin's attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No."
