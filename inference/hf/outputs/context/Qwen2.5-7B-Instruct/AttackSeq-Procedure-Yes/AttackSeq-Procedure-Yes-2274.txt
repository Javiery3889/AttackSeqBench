### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that Regin can be installed through various vectors, including web browser exploits or Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin's execution involves multiple stages, with Stage 4 being the user-mode orchestrator and multiple kernel payload modules. Stage 4 loads Stage 5, which brings in the main Regin payload functionality.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide explicit details on persistence mechanisms but suggests a long-term presence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Regin uses advanced techniques to evade detection, including encrypted data blobs and stealthy storage.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic.
   - **Collection:** Regin has extensive collection capabilities, including capturing screenshots, taking control of the mouse, and monitoring network traffic.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin can communicate bidirectionally with compromised computers and use various protocols for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP and TCP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after injecting files into `services.exe`, Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization before employing its remote access Trojan (RAT) capabilities to capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process and Memory Utilization:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Regin gathering information on processes and memory utilization as a separate step before employing its RAT capabilities.
   - **Remote Access Trojan Capabilities:** The CTI outline does mention that Regin can capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection, which aligns with the question's second part.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** The question implies a sequence where Regin first gathers information and then uses its RAT capabilities. However, the CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence indicating this intermediate step.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of Regin gathering information on processes and memory utilization before employing its RAT capabilities. The outline focuses more on the execution and collection capabilities of Regin, but it does not detail a specific sequence that includes this intermediate step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
