### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites, disguised as PowerPoint presentations.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - **Collection Phase:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any TTPs related to capturing audio from the microphone or copying files to a special USB device.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if "Machete" is likely to capture audio from the computer's microphone and copy files to a special USB device during the collection phase.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the initial access and persistence phases of the attack. It does not provide any information about the collection phase, specifically mentioning audio capture or USB file copying.
   - The question asks about a specific TTP (audio capture and USB file copying) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given that the CTI outline does not provide any information about the collection phase, specifically regarding audio capture or USB file copying, and the question asks about these specific TTPs, the most plausible answer is that these actions are not mentioned and thus not likely to be part of the attack sequence described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
