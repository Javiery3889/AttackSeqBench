### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is executed via a service and uses CreateProcessA for file execution.
   - **Persistence:** The installer creates a new service for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor decrypts strings and components, timestomps files, masquerades tasks or services, modifies the registry, and has encrypted strings and components.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor can obtain file and directory listings, list running processes, obtain system information, obtain the local IP address, and system time.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor encrypts C&C traffic using XOR, communicates with C&C via Tor, and exfiltrates data to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor exfiltrates data to its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Vyveva's backdoor, after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time, is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files before compressing the collected files and sending them to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the backdoor collecting files from newly inserted removable media or compressing and sending them to the C&C server.
   - The outline does mention that the backdoor can obtain file and directory listings (T1083) and exfiltrate data to the C&C server (T1041).
   - However, there is no specific information about the backdoor collecting files from removable media or compressing and sending them to the C&C server.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the backdoor performing the actions described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
