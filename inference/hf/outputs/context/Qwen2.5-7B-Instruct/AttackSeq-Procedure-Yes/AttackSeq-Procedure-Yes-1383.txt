### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI report by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov describes the reconnaissance efforts of cybercriminals targeting medical networks.
   - Key tactics used include:
     - **Masscan**: To identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
     - **Shodan and Censys**: To find publicly available resources of these organizations.
   - The report highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as:
     - Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol.
     - Printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys for reconnaissance, various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery.
   - The key elements to consider are:
     - The use of reconnaissance tools to identify potential entry points.
     - The discovery of non-trivial ports and services, including outdated systems and medical devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the reconnaissance efforts led to the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems and printers with web interfaces without authentication.
   - These findings align with the question's assertion that various services, including outdated systems and medical devices, would be discovered during network service discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the detailed information in the CTI outline about the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, it is highly likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, would be discovered as part of network service discovery.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the answer choice that indicates such discoveries are likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
