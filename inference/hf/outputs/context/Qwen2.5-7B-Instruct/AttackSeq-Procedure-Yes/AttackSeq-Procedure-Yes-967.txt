Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used various methods to gain initial access, including weaponized RTF files, archive files, and direct delivery.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:** The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to gather various types of information, including OS information, file metadata, and network information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with C&C servers using HTTP and TCP protocols, sending collected data with an XORed password.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor will gather system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP during the Discovery phase before sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Aria-body backdoor has the capability to gather OS information, which includes system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.
   - The collection phase of the Aria-body backdoor is described as including gathering file metadata, OS information, and network information, which aligns with the question's focus on system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to gather a wide range of information, including system information.
   - The question specifically asks about the Discovery phase, which is part of the collection phase.
   - The CTI outline confirms that the Aria-body backdoor can gather system information as part of its collection capabilities.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that the Aria-body backdoor will gather system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP during the Discovery phase before sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during Command and Control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
