### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641, leading to a multi-stage execution process.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through:
     - Modifying registry keys such as `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`.
     - Injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into the `explorer.exe` process for persistent execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:** T9000 used various evasion techniques, including customizing its installation to avoid detection by 24 security products and creating mutexes and named events.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to use methods such as sideloading a malicious DLL (`hccutils.dll`) through a legitimate executable (`igfxtray.exe`) before setting registry keys and injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe` for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention sideloading a malicious DLL through a legitimate executable. Instead, it describes T9000 injecting `ResN32.dll` directly into `explorer.exe` for persistence.
   - The outline does not provide any information about sideloading or using `igfxtray.exe` as a vector for persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, T9000 does not use sideloading a malicious DLL through a legitimate executable for persistence. The outline specifically mentions injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe` for persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
