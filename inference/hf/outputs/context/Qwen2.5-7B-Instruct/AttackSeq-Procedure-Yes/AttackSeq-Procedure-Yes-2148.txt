Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Phishing campaigns with PE attachments and later with malicious macro-laden Word documents.
- **Execution**: 
  - FlowCloud macro uses privacy-enhanced mail ('.pem') files, renames them to 'pense1.txt', and saves them as 'gup.exe'.
  - 'gup.exe' is executed using a version of certutil.exe named 'Temptcm.tmp'.
  - The FlowCloud macro introduces a new method for delivering the payload via a DropBox URL or a catch statement for an alternative URL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if, after the execution of 'gup.exe' using 'Temptcm.tmp', the FlowCloud malware will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or any similar persistence mechanism after the execution of 'gup.exe'.
- The outline focuses on the renaming and execution of 'gup.exe' and the subsequent attempt to download the payload from a DropBox URL or an alternative URL.
- There is no information provided about 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or any other persistence mechanism in the given CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or any similar persistence mechanism.
- The question introduces a new executable ('EhStorAuthn.exe') that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the lack of information about 'EhStorAuthn.exe' in the CTI outline, it is not plausible that the FlowCloud malware would execute this executable as part of the described sequence.

### Final Answer: B: No
