Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: A phishing email impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' was sent, leading to the execution of a malicious URL that installs the FriarFox browser extension.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The FriarFox browser extension provides the threat actors with access to the user's Gmail account and Firefox browser data. It also contacts a command and control (C2) server to retrieve the PHP and JS-based payload Scanbox.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the initial access via the phishing email, the threat actors will use the FriarFox browser extension to contact a C2 server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the FriarFox browser extension, once installed, contacts a C2 server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
- The question directly asks if this sequence of actions is likely, and the CTI outline provides a direct answer to this.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the FriarFox browser extension, after being installed, contacts a C2 server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
- This sequence of actions aligns perfectly with the question's query.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
