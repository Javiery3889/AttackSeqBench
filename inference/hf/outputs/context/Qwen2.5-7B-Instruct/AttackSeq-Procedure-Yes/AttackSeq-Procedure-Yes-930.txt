### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** Targets publicly facing web servers, with both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan contains a main executable and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:** Explosive can be installed in various system directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hides from detection tools and merges into its surroundings.
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining administrator passwords through keylogging, the Explosive Trojan is likely to use a configurable USB infection option for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the attackers use various means to penetrate the internal network, including manual online hacking and an automated USB infection mechanism. This indicates that the Explosive Trojan can use a USB infection for Lateral Movement.
   - The outline also states that the attackers use a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control. However, it does not explicitly state the order in which these tactics are employed.
   - Given the context, it is plausible that the attackers might use the USB infection for Lateral Movement to move laterally within the network before establishing a Command and Control framework. This would allow them to gain deeper access and control over the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes

The reasoning is that the Explosive Trojan, after gaining administrator passwords through keylogging, can use the configurable USB infection option for Lateral Movement to move laterally within the network. This would provide the attackers with a foothold in different parts of the network before establishing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.
