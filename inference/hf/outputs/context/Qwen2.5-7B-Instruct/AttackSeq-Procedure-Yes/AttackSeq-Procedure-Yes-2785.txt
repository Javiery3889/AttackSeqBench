Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on iOS devices, specifically targeting iOS 7 and earlier versions.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is designed to run in the background and collect various types of data from the device.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and other information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the XAgent app, after collecting data, will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests while using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention how the data is exfiltrated. However, it does provide context about the app's capabilities and the environment in which it operates.
   - The question is asking about a specific method of exfiltration (HTTP requests with Base64 encoded token) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - Given the nature of the malware and the context provided, it is plausible that the malware could use HTTP requests to exfiltrate data, as this is a common method for data exfiltration. However, the use of a Base64 encoded token for identification is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the initial access, execution, and data collection capabilities of the XAgent app.
   - There is no information provided about the exfiltration method or the use of a Base64 encoded token.
   - While it is plausible that the malware could use HTTP requests for exfiltration, the specific mention of a Base64 encoded token is not supported by the CTI outline.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the lack of specific information about the exfiltration method and the use of a Base64 encoded token, the most plausible answer is that the CTI outline does not provide enough evidence to support the exfiltration method described in the question.
   - Therefore, the answer is "No."

Final Answer: B: No
