Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Initial Access**: Phishing emails with a specific document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
3. **Execution**: VBS macro in the Word document executes a PowerShell script.
4. **Defense Evasion**: PowerShell script operates in memory, uses DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
5. **Impact**: Downloads and executes GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after evading defenses by operating in memory and using the DCOM object, the PowerShell script is likely to communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the PowerShell script, after evading defenses, downloads and executes GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
- The question specifically asks about the likelihood of the script communicating with C2 servers and downloading these payloads.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention communication with C2 servers, but it does state that the script downloads and executes the payloads.
- Given the context of the attack, it is reasonable to assume that the script would communicate with C2 servers to download the payloads, as this is a common TTP in such campaigns.

Based on the information provided and the common practices in cyber attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerShell script would indeed communicate with C2 servers and download the specified payloads.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
