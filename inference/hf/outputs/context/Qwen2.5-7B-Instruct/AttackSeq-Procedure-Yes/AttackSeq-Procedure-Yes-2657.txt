Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Resource Development**: The campaign uses a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
- **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used.
- **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
- **Persistence**: Persistence is established by creating a directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
- **Defense Evasion**: Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
- **Discovery**: Korplug collects extensive system information.
- **Collection**: Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting data, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly states that the exfiltration is performed via a "custom protocol used to send and receive commands, involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body."
- The question mentions a custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration, which aligns with the CTI outline.
- The question also mentions an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, but the CTI outline does not provide any information about an initial handshake. The exfiltration is described as directly using TCP without any mention of HTTPS.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the exfiltration uses a custom TCP-based protocol, which matches the first part of the question.
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, so we cannot confirm this part of the question.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration, but there is no evidence of an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.

### Final Answer: B: No
