### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 is delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a legitimate Microsoft executable to sideload a malicious DLL.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 sets up persistence through registry keys and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware evades detection by customizing its installation and using mutexes.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captures data from Skype communications and removable media.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol, sending encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to compress and encrypt data for exfiltration after collecting it from Skype and removable drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention data compression or encryption for exfiltration. However, it does mention that the malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol and sends encrypted traffic.
   - The use of encryption for C2 communication suggests that the malware is designed to protect the data it exfiltrates. While the outline does not explicitly state data compression, the need to securely transmit data over a C2 channel implies that the data might be compressed to reduce the size and improve transmission efficiency.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of secure communication and the need to efficiently transmit data, it is reasonable to infer that T9000 would likely compress and encrypt the data it collects before exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that T9000 would indeed compress and encrypt the data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
