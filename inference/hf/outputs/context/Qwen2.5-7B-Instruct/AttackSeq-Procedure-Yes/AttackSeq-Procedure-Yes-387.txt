### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The backdoor (Vyveva) is executed via a service and uses the CreateProcessA API.
   - **Persistence:** The installer creates a new service to ensure persistence.
   - **Discovery:** Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings, list running processes, and gather system information.
   - **Collection:** Vyveva can compress files with zlib, collect files, and notify C&C about newly inserted removable media.
   - **Command and Control:** Vyveva encrypts C&C traffic using XOR and communicates via Tor.
   - **Exfiltration:** Vyveva exfiltrates data to its C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Vyveva is likely to have encrypted strings and components for achieving Defense Evasion before compressing and collecting files for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Vyveva encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001) and communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002). This indicates that Vyveva uses encryption for C&C communication, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
   - The question specifically asks about encryption of strings and components before compression and exfiltration. While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that Vyveva encrypts strings and components, the use of XOR for C&C communication suggests that the backdoor likely employs encryption techniques to evade detection and protect its communications.
   - The CTI outline also mentions that Vyveva's components include an installer, loader, and main payload, with the installer ensuring persistence and storing configuration in the registry. This implies that the backdoor has a modular structure, which could include encrypted strings and components to evade detection.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to infer that Vyveva likely employs encryption techniques, including for strings and components, to achieve Defense Evasion. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the backdoor having encrypted strings and components before compressing and collecting files for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
