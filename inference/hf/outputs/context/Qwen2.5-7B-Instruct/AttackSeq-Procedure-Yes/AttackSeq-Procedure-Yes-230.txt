Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: The Lazarus group installed backdoors (BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) on financial institutions' machines.
- **Defense Evasion**: The backdoors use a sophisticated technique involving a loader DLL and an encrypted backdoor. The loader DLL is responsible for loading the encrypted backdoor to decrypt and execute it in memory. The encrypted configuration file contains C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if, after utilizing a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory, the Lazarus group is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control (C&C) servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the encrypted configuration file (which contains C&C information) is necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities.
- This implies that the backdoor needs to connect to C&C servers to receive commands and conduct its activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The loader DLL decrypts and executes the encrypted backdoor in memory.
- The encrypted configuration file, which contains C&C information, is essential for the backdoor to function.
- Therefore, the backdoor must connect to C&C servers to receive commands and conduct its activities.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the backdoors will indeed connect to C&C servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
