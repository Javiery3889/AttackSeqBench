Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack, including copying content to a temporary directory, using 'certutil.exe' renamed to 'gosia.exe', decoding a base64 blob, decompressing content, and executing a JavaScript file.
   - **Persistence:** The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' in a public downloads directory, executes 'svchast.exe', copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as 'officeupdate.exe', and adds 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack uses renamed commands to bypass security detection.
   - **Discovery:** The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' with the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information.
   - **Command and Control:** The final shellcode makes HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will perform specific actions (creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL) after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack that includes creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL. These actions are consistent with the persistence and command and control phases of the attack.
   - The Higaisa APT group is known for using sophisticated techniques, including the use of LNK files and JavaScript to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. The actions described in the question align with the tactics and techniques used by the Higaisa APT group as detailed in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the detailed alignment of the actions described in the question with the attack sequence and tactics used by the Higaisa APT group, it is highly likely that the group would employ these methods.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A: Yes"
