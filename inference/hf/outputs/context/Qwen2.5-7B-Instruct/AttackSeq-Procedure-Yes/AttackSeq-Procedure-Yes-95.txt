Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-1182 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
2. **Execution**: The HTA file executed a script that stopped if certain antivirus software was detected. If not detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.
3. **Persistence**: The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and used VBS. The backdoor employed DLL sideloading using cmpbk32.dll to execute Srvstr.exe.
5. **Discovery**: The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.
6. **Others**: Indicators of compromise include various hashes and the domain webserv-redir.net.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file and using WMI to check for installed antivirus software before executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the HTA file was downloaded from the domain webserv-redir.net.
- The HTA file checks for installed antivirus software using WMI.
- If the antivirus software is not detected, the HTA file proceeds to execute the FinalBot backdoor.
- The backdoor is then used to establish persistence and perform defense evasion techniques.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The HTA file is dropped from webserv-redir.net.
2. **Execution**: The HTA file checks for antivirus software and, if not detected, proceeds to execute the FinalBot backdoor.
3. **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: The FinalBot backdoor is established and uses DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
4. **Command and Control**: The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server, but it is a common TTP for APTs to establish a C2 channel.

Given the context and the typical behavior of APTs, it is highly likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server, especially since the domain webserv-redir.net is used for the initial download and is an indicator of compromise.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
