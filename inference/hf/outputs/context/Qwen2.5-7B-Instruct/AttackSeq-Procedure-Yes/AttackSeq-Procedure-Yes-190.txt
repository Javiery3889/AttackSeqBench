Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following TTPs:
1. **Execution**: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
2. **Persistence**: The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware inherits root privileges.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware decompresses executables and checks if it is executed by init.
5. **Credential Access**: The malware scrapes credentials and key information.
6. **Discovery**: The malware enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
7. **Collection**: The malware collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
8. **Command and Control**: The malware uses a Tor hidden service and SSH for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data, Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate these files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we know that Infamous Chisel has a **Command and Control** TTP that involves using a Tor hidden service and SSH for command and control. This suggests that the malware can use these methods for exfiltration.

However, the outline does not explicitly state that the malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals. The outline only mentions that the malware collects files and uses a Tor hidden service and SSH for command and control, but it does not specify the frequency or regularity of exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide specific information about the frequency or regularity of exfiltration.
- The malware's TTPs include collection and command and control, which can involve exfiltration, but the outline does not confirm this specific behavior.
- The question asks about a specific behavior (exfiltration at regular intervals) that is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not necessarily exfiltrate files at regular intervals, as this behavior is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B: No**
