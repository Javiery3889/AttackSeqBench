Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Deployed Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen credentials.
2. **Execution**: Deployed Trochilus malware with encrypted C2 communications.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Utilized DLL sideloading to execute a legitimate binary and load a renamed malicious DLL.
5. **Credential Access**: Used Mimikatz to access the domain controller and deploy Trochilus.
6. **Lateral Movement**: Logged in to the network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts.
7. **Collection**: Compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR.
8. **Command and Control**: Used Trochilus with encrypted C2 communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the exfiltration phase, specifically:
- After compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase.
- Whether the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we can see that the exfiltration phase is not explicitly detailed. However, the question is asking about a specific method of exfiltration (using custom malware and cURL for Windows).

- **Custom Malware**: The CTI outline does not mention the use of custom malware for exfiltration.
- **cURL for Windows**: The CTI outline mentions the use of cURL for Windows in the Command and Control phase, but not specifically for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of custom malware for exfiltration.
- The use of cURL for Windows is mentioned in the Command and Control phase, but not specifically for exfiltration.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use custom malware and cURL for Windows to exfiltrate files, which is not supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
