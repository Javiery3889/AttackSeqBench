### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance, loading them directly into memory without writing to disk.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded commercial EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance and deleted the output files after retrieval.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying NodeIISWeb, which provided backdoor functionality.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, TG1021 would likely access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention TG1021 accessing shared folders over SMB or dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader for lateral movement.
   - The outline focuses on initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and command and control mechanisms, but does not detail specific lateral movement techniques.
   - The question assumes a specific sequence of actions (accessing shared folders, dropping NodeIISWeb) that are not directly supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of TG1021 performing lateral movement by accessing shared folders over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader. The outline does not provide enough context to support this specific sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
