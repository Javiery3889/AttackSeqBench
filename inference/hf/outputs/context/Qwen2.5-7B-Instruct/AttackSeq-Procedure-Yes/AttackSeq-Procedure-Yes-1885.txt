Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
- **Persistence**: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and using trojanized versions of KeePass binaries.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, it is likely that FIN13 will employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that FIN13 deploys web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE, for initial access.
- **Persistence**: The CTI outline mentions that FIN13 uses persistence methods such as deploying malware like SIXPACK and using trojanized versions of KeePass binaries.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Sequence of TTPs**: The CTI outline indicates that BLUEAGAVE is used for initial access, and SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are used for persistence.
- **Question Context**: The question asks if BLUEAGAVE is used for persistence after initial access, which is not the case based on the CTI outline. BLUEAGAVE is used for initial access, and persistence is established using other methods.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs does not support the idea that BLUEAGAVE is used for persistence after initial access. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
