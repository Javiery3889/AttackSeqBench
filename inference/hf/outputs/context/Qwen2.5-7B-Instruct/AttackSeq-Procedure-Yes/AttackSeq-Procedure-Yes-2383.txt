Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
2. **Execution**: Malware (TDrop2) executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable from the system32 folder and used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Process hollowing and obfuscation techniques were used to evade detection.
4. **Discovery**: The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware TDrop2 used process hollowing as part of its execution phase to evade detection.
- The outline also mentions that after execution, the malware performed discovery activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly describes the sequence of TTPs: initial access via spear-phishing, followed by execution using process hollowing, and then discovery activities.
- The question aligns with this sequence, asking if the malware would perform execution using process hollowing before discovery activities.

Given the clear sequence in the CTI outline, the answer is straightforward.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
