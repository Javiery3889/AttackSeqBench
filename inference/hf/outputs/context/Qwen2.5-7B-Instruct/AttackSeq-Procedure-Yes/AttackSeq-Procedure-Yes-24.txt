### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites, with the malware embedded in PowerPoint presentations disguised as self-extracting archives.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline provides details on the initial access and persistence mechanisms but does not mention any specific actions related to copying files to a USB device.
   - The persistence mechanism described involves creating a task and storing the malware in a specific directory, but there is no information about copying files to a USB device.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that Machete copies files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities. The outline focuses on the initial access and persistence mechanisms but does not mention any USB-related activities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
