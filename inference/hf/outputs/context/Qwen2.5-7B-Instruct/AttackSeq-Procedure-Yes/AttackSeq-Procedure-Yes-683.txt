### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used malicious .LNK files to gain initial access to systems.
   - **Execution:** The worm's main module contained multiple resources, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stuxnet used zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Stuxnet exploited MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked machines.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement, Stuxnet is likely to communicate with its C&C servers using encrypted channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of encrypted channels for communication with C&C servers. However, given Stuxnet's sophisticated nature and the need to evade detection, it is highly plausible that it would use encrypted channels to communicate with its C&C servers.
   - The CTI outline mentions that Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates to evade detection, which aligns with the idea of using encrypted channels to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

### Final Answer:
Based on the sophisticated nature of Stuxnet and the need to evade detection, it is highly likely that Stuxnet would use encrypted channels for communication with its C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
