Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and answer the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems, similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
- **Execution**: 
  - On iOS 7, the XAgent app is fully functional, with the icon hidden and it runs in the background. It restarts automatically when terminated.
  - On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.
- **Command and Control**: 
  - The app sends collected information via HTTP using POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands.
  - Log messages are written in HTML and color-coded, with error messages in red and others in green.
  - The C&C HTTP requests use a randomly generated URI based on a template.
  - The app uses FTP to upload files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the XAgent app, after executing itself in the background on iOS 7 devices while hiding its icon and restarting when terminated, is likely to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of geo-location data. However, it does describe the app's behavior and communication methods.
- The question focuses on the app's behavior on iOS 7 and its potential to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any specific information about the app collecting geo-location data. The focus is on the app's behavior, such as hiding its icon, restarting when terminated, and sending data via HTTP and FTP.
- Given the lack of explicit mention of geo-location data collection in the CTI outline, and the fact that the question is asking about a specific TTP (geo-location data collection) that is not described in the outline, we must infer based on the available information.

### Final Answer: B: No

The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that the XAgent app collects geo-location data as part of its discovery routine. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the app does not collect geo-location data in this context.
