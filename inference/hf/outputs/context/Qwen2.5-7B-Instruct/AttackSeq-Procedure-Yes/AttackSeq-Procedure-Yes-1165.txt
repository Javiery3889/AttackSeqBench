### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Longhorn group uses a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and includes detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware configures specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
   - **Exfiltration:** Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomizes communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using a zero-day exploit to infect a target with Plexor malware, Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected. This includes:
     - Configuring specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers.
     - Using privacy services to hide their real identity.
     - Communicating with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
     - Randomizing communication intervals to avoid detection.
   - These measures are consistent with the need to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the emphasis on operational security and avoiding detection in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
