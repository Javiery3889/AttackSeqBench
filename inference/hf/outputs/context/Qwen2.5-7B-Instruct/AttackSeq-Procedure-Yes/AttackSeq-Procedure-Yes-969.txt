### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used various methods, including a weaponized RTF file and an Aria-body loader.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader is responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, and decrypting configuration data.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, and it also injects itself into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group uses fileless loading techniques and changes server infrastructure and loader variants to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** The Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor, after achieving persistence and injecting itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe', is likely to gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that the Aria-body backdoor has the capability to "enumerate process loaded modules" and "gather file metadata." This indicates that the backdoor can gather information about the processes running on the system and the files present.
   - The question specifically asks about gathering information about the installed software and Windows version, which falls under the category of "gather file metadata" and "collect OS information."
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to collect a wide range of information, including OS details, which aligns with the question's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed capabilities of the Aria-body backdoor as described in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that the backdoor would gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
