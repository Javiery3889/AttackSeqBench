Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Compromise a website and add code to redirect visitors to infecting code.
2. **Execution**: Multi-stage infection process, including exploiting VBScript engine vulnerability and CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
3. **Persistence**: SLUB backdoor copies itself to ProgramData\update\ and creates a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Evasion tactic to avoid detection by security software.
6. **Collection**: Supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website.
7. **Command and Control**: Communicates with the attackers via Slack.
8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the backdoor retrieving the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics.
- The collection phase mentions various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. However, it does not specifically mention retrieving the username and computer name.
- The exfiltration phase involves uploading files to the file.io website and sharing links via Slack, but it does not mention the retrieval of the username and computer name.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the SLUB backdoor retrieves the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics.
- The question asks if this is likely, and based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of this action.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor is not likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics.

**Final Answer: B: No**
