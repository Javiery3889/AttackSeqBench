Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'. Upon execution, the HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file while simultaneously executing a backdoor in the background. The malware installer utilizes embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs evasion techniques such as minimizing the script window and avoiding the display of the window taskbar. It also uses obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files, and it checks for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after delivering the malware via 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta' and executing the embedded VB Script to drop and open a decoy Microsoft Word file, it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the creation of a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
- The outline does mention that the malware uses obfuscation and minimizes visibility, but it does not specify the exact method of creating a new process or the specific file handling techniques.
- The question asks about a specific sequence of actions (creating a new process, executing a dropped '.exe' file, and rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder) that are not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the initial delivery method and the use of VB Script for execution and obfuscation. It does not provide detailed information about the creation of a new process or the specific file handling techniques mentioned in the question.
- Given the information provided, the CTI outline does not support the specific sequence of actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: No
