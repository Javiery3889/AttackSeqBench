### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** A spear phishing email delivers a CAB archive named 1-10-20-hb44_final, which contains a remote access Trojan (RAT) named BlackSoul.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader (1-10-20-hb44_final.exe) to execute BlackSoul, which opens a legitimate document as a decoy.
   - **Defense Evasion:** BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The DLL (blacksoulLib) searches for browser data, decodes C2 URLs, and returns gathered data to BlackSoul.
   - **Collection:** BlackSoul can handle commands from the C2 server, execute commands, download files, and update configuration files.
   - **Command and Control:** BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding, hosted on Cloudflare Workers Service and supports DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlackSoul is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration after communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention automated exfiltration as a TTP. However, it does state that BlackSoul is capable of file transfers and running arbitrary commands, which can include exfiltration.
   - The malware's ability to handle commands from the C2 server and download/upload files suggests it has the capability to exfiltrate data.
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of automated exfiltration, which is a plausible action given the malware's capabilities and the context of the attack.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, BlackSoul has the capability to exfiltrate data through the C2 channel. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is likely to exfiltrate data through automated exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
