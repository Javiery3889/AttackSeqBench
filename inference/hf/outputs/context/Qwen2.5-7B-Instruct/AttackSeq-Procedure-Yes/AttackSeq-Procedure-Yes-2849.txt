Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Malicious shortcut files are sent via email.
- **Execution**: 
  - Opening the malicious shortcut file triggers a PowerShell command.
  - The PowerShell command downloads a batch file.
  - The batch file executes PowerShell scripts to download:
    - A Windows executable (downloader).
    - A decoy document (in Japanese and Chinese).

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document, the downloader is likely to retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any image file or command and control phase retrieval of encoded malware.
- The execution phase clearly states that the downloader downloads a Windows executable and a decoy document. There is no indication of any additional image file or encoded malware being retrieved.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the initial access and execution phases, detailing the steps taken to download the Windows executable and decoy document.
- There is no information provided about a command and control phase or any additional image file being retrieved.
- Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the retrieval of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

### Final Answer: B: No
