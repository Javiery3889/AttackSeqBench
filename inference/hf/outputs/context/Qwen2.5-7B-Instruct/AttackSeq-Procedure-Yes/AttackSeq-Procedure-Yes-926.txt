### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** Targets publicly facing web servers, uses both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan with main executable and DLL components.
   - **Persistence:** Installation of Explosive with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hides from detection tools, changes versions and builds, and uses custom configurations.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Spreads manually to the entire network or infects USB devices.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Volatile Cedar campaign will leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols after lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations. The focus is on the initial access, execution, persistence, and lateral movement through manual or USB infection.
   - The question is asking about a specific aspect of command and control (C2) infrastructure, which is not directly addressed in the provided CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations. The outline focuses more on the methods of initial access, persistence, and lateral movement rather than the C2 infrastructure.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Volatile Cedar campaign does not leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: B: No**
