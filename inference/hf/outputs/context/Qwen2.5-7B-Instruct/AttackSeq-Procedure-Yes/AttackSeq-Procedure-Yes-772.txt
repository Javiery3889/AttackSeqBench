Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Patchwork targeted US-based think tanks, using themes and domains similar to well-known think tank organizations.
2. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails were sent with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
3. **Persistence**: After the initial dropper (qrat.exe) is executed, it creates a directory and drops the final QuasarRAT binary, and also creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
4. **Command and Control**: The malware initiates a request to determine the geographical location and then establishes a connection to the C2 domain.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the spear phishing emails contained links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750. These documents are described as "malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents" and are not explicitly described as simulating legitimate blog posts or reports.
- The outline does not mention any step where the recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that suggests the recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the infection.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline involves sending spear phishing emails with RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750, and then the execution of the malware (QuasarRAT) without any intermediate step of presenting a legitimate document.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that recipients are not presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: B: No**
