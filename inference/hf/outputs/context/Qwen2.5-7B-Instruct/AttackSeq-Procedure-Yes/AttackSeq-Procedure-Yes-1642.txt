### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** PowerShell commands downloaded malicious payloads from compromised servers.
   - **Execution:** PowerShell commands initiated the download of a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems. The script applied hotfixes for specific vulnerabilities and used PowerSploit and Tater modules to install the MSI package.
   - **Persistence:** The MSI package ensured persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations from the registry and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory. It modified registry values to allow file rename operations upon system restart, replacing sens.dll with the malware to run as the SENS service.
   - **Command and Control:** The new .NET backdoor, FoxSocket, established a secure C&C channel using WebSockets.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after ensuring persistence by replacing sens.dll with the PurpleFox backdoor, it is likely that PurpleFox will install a rootkit driver to evade detection and create a firewall rule to block specific ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any rootkit driver installation or firewall rule creation.
   - The persistence mechanism described involves modifying the registry to replace sens.dll with the malware, which is a common method to ensure the malware runs on system startup.
   - The C&C channel is established using a .NET backdoor and WebSockets, which are stealthier methods compared to traditional rootkit drivers.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication of rootkit driver installation or firewall rule creation. The persistence mechanism and C&C channel described are more aligned with typical malware behavior without the need for such advanced evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: B: No**
