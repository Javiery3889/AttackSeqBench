Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack targets Mexican banking institutions and is linked to a Brazilian campaign.
2. **Execution**: The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is used to execute a PowerShell script that downloads and runs the main malware.
3. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for creating startup persistence features.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses VMProtect to protect itself and is designed to evade static analysis.
5. **Credential Access**: The malware aims to steal bank credentials and access Outlook info.
6. **Collection**: The malware collects email accounts from the contacts list.
7. **Command and Control**: The script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.
8. **Exfiltration**: The collected data is exfiltrated through a POST web request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email, the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file is delivered via a phishing email.
- **Execution**: The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is executed, which includes a batch script that downloads and runs a PowerShell script from the Internet.
- **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for creating startup persistence features.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file is delivered via a phishing email, which aligns with the Initial Access phase.
2. The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is executed, which is part of the Execution phase.
3. The batch script then executes a PowerShell script from the Internet, which is also part of the Execution phase.
4. The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for creating startup persistence features, which is part of the Persistence phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, the attack indeed proceeds to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
