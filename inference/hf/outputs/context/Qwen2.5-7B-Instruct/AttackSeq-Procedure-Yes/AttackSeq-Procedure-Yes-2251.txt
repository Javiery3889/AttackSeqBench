### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Persistence:** They use malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers, as well as registry keys and VBScripts for persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** They target Kavach, an MFA app, and deploy njRAT malware with special victim IDs.
   - **Discovery:** They use decoy documents and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** They use modular plugins for specific tasks like file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** They use fake websites or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases using GoLang-based file recon plugins.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if SideCopy will likely employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents after maintaining persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Decoy Documents:** The CTI outline mentions that SideCopy uses decoy documents posing as internal, operational documents of the Indian Army to lure victims.
   - **Mimicking Legitimate Processes:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention SideCopy mimicking legitimate processes to evade detection. However, the use of decoy documents and honeytraps suggests a strategy to blend in with legitimate activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the CTI outline indicates the use of decoy documents and honeytraps, it is reasonable to infer that SideCopy might also employ tactics to mimic legitimate processes to evade detection. While not explicitly stated, the use of such tactics is a common practice in APTs to blend in with normal activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
