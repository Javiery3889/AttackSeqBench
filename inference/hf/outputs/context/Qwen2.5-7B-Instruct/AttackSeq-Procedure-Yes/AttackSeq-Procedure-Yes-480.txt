Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Trickbot is delivered via a malicious Word document with an enabled macro.
2. **Execution**: The obfuscated JS file runs in the background, creating a copy of itself in the Startup folder for persistence.
3. **Persistence**: Trickbot creates a copy of itself in the Startup folder as `Shell.jse`.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Trickbot checks for virtual or sandbox environments and specific analysis-related processes.
5. **Credential Access**: Trickbot steals credentials from various applications and browsers.
6. **Collection**: Trickbot uses a PoS extraction module and a proxy module to intercept and modify web traffic.
7. **Command and Control**: Trickbot connects to a C2 server to download and execute its payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after connecting to the C2 server, Trickbot is likely to proceed to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to deleting files with specific extensions in removable and network drives. The outline focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, and command and control. There is no indication of any file deletion activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about Trickbot deleting files with specific extensions.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (deleting files) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no evidence to suggest that Trickbot would perform this action.

### Final Answer: B: No
