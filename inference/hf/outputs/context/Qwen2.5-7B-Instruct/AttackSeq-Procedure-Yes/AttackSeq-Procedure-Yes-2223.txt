Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: Earth Lusca used various reconnaissance techniques, including scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands such as 'hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443' to gather information.
- **Discovery**: The group used multiple scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network environment.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using scanning tools and commands during the discovery phase, it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Relevant TTPs from the CTI Outline**:
  - **Discovery**: Earth Lusca used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
  - **Lateral Movement**: The question is asking about the next likely step after discovery, which is typically lateral movement.
  - **Command and Control**: The group used application layer protocols, data obfuscation, encrypted channels, non-standard ports, protocol tunneling, proxies, and remote access software to communicate with compromised systems.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Discovery Phase**: Earth Lusca has already used scanning tools to identify potential targets within the network.
- **Lateral Movement**: After identifying potential targets, the next logical step is to move laterally within the network to gain access to more systems.
- **Command and Control**: Establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers is a common method for maintaining persistent access and exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs and the context provided in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that after the discovery phase, Earth Lusca would engage in lateral movement and establish network tunnels for command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
