### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI report by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov describes the reconnaissance efforts of cybercriminals targeting medical networks.
   - Key points include:
     - Use of masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
     - Use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources.
     - Discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using masscan and search engines, the cybercriminals likely discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter.
   - The key elements to consider are:
     - The use of masscan and search engines for reconnaissance.
     - The discovery of Building Management systems and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions the discovery of Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.
   - The MQTT protocol is not specifically mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The question asks about outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol, which is not directly stated in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the MQTT protocol or the specific mention of outdated Building Management systems.
   - The information provided in the CTI outline aligns more closely with the discovery of Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the information provided in the CTI outline is "No."

### Final Answer: B: No
