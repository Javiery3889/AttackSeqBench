### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** GreyEnergy targets energy companies and high-value organizations in Ukraine and Poland for espionage and reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules.
   - **Initial Access:** GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers as infection vectors.
   - **Persistence:** Operators securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses common tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Deploys internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.
   - **Others:** GreyEnergy is linked to BlackEnergy and TeleBots, with a focus on stealth and modern toolkit.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if GreyEnergy, after gaining initial access through spearphishing and compromised web servers, would implement stealth techniques such as pushing only selected modules to selected targets, partially encrypting these modules using AES-256, and running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealth Techniques:**
     - **Pushing Only Selected Modules:** The CTI outline mentions that GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules. This suggests that they can selectively deploy modules based on the target's environment.
     - **Partial Encryption Using AES-256:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention AES-256 encryption, but it does highlight the use of operational security techniques, which could include encryption to avoid detection.
     - **Running Modules Fileless in Memory:** The CTI outline mentions that GreyEnergy operators use a 'mini' backdoor before deploying the full version, which could imply running some modules in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the modular nature of GreyEnergy's malware framework and the emphasis on operational security techniques, it is plausible that GreyEnergy would implement these stealth techniques to avoid detection and analysis.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
