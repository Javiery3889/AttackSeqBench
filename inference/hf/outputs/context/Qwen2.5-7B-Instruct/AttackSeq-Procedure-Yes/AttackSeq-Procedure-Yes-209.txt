Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Use of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creation of registry Run key entry and installation as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Injection of encrypted shellcode and token privilege adjustments.
7. **Credential Access**: Use of a custom Mimikatz version.
8. **Discovery**: Collection of system information.
9. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
10. **Command and Control**: Communication with the C&C server using HTTPS and multi-byte XOR encryption.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor after performing Command and Control activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that SparrowDoor is used for both Command and Control and Collection.
- Specifically, SparrowDoor is mentioned to have the ability to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Command and Control**: SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.
2. **Collection**: SparrowDoor is capable of reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
3. **Exfiltration**: Given that SparrowDoor is designed to read and exfiltrate file contents, it is highly likely that it would use the C&C channel for this purpose.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
