### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - **Execution:** Use of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of registry Run key entries and installation as a service.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Not detailed in the report.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injection of encrypted shellcode and token privilege adjustments.
   - **Credential Access:** Use of a custom Mimikatz version to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collection of system information, including usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information, it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention reading file contents as part of the Collection phase. However, the Discovery phase does mention probing files in specified directories to obtain their names, attributes, sizes, and last modified times.
   - While the Discovery phase involves gathering metadata about files, the question specifically asks about reading file contents, which is a more detailed and targeted action.
   - The CTI report does not provide any information suggesting that FamousSparrow reads file contents as part of their Collection tactics.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of reading file contents as part of the Collection phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that FamousSparrow would read file contents as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating the files.

**Final Answer: B: No**
