Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
   - **Persistence:** The device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing.
   - **Discovery:** Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected.
   - **Lateral Movement:** No lateral movement or data exfiltration was detected after C2 beaconing.
   - **Command and Control:** Darktrace detected C2 activity without relying on signatures or threat intelligence, and the C2 destinations included known malicious domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that "Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected."
   - This aligns directly with the question's scenario of automating the investigation process after Command and Control detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is indeed likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
