Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software.
3. **Persistence**: The malware persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including daemonizing and detaching from the 3CX process, deleting itself from disk, and writing configuration files to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
5. **Discovery**: The malware collects information from the victim machine.
6. **Collection**: The malware stages and collects data from the victim machine.
7. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a HTTP GET request.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exfiltration method used by the malware. However, it does state that the malware collects and stages data, and then communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS.
- The question specifically asks about the exfiltration method, which is not directly addressed in the CTI outline. The outline does not mention HTTP GET requests or any specific exfiltration method.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the exfiltration method used by the malware. It only mentions that the malware collects and stages data and communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS.
- The question asks if the malware will automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after establishing HTTPS communication. This is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.
- The malware's communication with C2 servers is described as using HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm, but there is no mention of HTTP GET requests.

### Final Answer: B: No
