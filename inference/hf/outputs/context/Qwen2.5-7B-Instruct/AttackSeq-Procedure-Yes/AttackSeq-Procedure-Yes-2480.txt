Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Adversaries sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx) and exploited CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on the victim's machine.
2. **Execution**: Adversaries used PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for the execution of the Empire stager.
3. **Persistence**: Adversaries established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects and created a local account.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Adversaries used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
5. **Command and Control**: Adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel and used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication. They also employed symmetric and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development, after initiating the attack by sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the acquisition of infrastructure such as domains for command and control servers.
- The command and control (C2) channel is described as using an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication. This suggests that the attackers did not need to acquire new infrastructure but rather repurposed an existing service.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the attackers acquiring new infrastructure such as domains.
- The use of an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive) for C2 communication indicates that the attackers did not need to develop or acquire new infrastructure.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attackers did not acquire new infrastructure for C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B: No**
