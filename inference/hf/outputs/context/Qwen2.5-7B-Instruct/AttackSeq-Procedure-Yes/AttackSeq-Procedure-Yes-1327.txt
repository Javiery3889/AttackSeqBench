Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader that was updated in mid-April 2014.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and exports certificates.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns.
6. **Collection**: CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
7. **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration and updates.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.
- The question specifically asks about the exfiltration phase, which is part of the Command and Control (C2) phase in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Extraction of Relevant Information**: The CTI outline explicitly mentions that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data.
2. **Matching the Question**: The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials during the Exfiltration phase.
3. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes** - This aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.
   - **B: No** - This does not align with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: Final Answer: A
