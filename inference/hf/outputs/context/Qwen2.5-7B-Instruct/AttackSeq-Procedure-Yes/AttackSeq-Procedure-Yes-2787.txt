Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on an iOS device, either through a poisoned app or by leveraging a known vulnerability in iOS 7.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs in the background, collects various types of data, and can restart automatically.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and performs other routines to gather information from the device.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the C2 communication protocols used by the malware. However, it does mention that the malware collects various types of data and runs in the background.
   - The question is asking about a specific sequence of C2 operations: sending data via HTTP and then uploading files via FTP.
   - Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the use of HTTP before FTP for C2 operations. The CTI outline focuses more on the malware's capabilities and behavior rather than its communication protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific C2 protocols or sequences.
   - The question asks about a specific sequence (HTTP before FTP) that is not supported by the provided information.
   - Without additional context or evidence, it is not plausible to assume that the malware follows this exact sequence of C2 operations.

**Final Answer: B: No**
