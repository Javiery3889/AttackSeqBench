Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader that was updated in mid-April 2014.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and data.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns and non-English filenames.
6. **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for data exfiltration.
7. **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer.
- The outline focuses on the methods of initial access, persistence, credential access, and data exfiltration via FTP.
- CosmicDuke is known to steal credentials and data from various software and the system, but there is no direct mention of keylogging, screenshotting, or clipboard stealing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about keylogging, screenshotting, or clipboard stealing.
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use these methods, but the provided information does not support this claim.
- Given the focus on credential access and data exfiltration via FTP, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke would use keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers based on the provided information.

### Final Answer: No
Final Answer: B: No
