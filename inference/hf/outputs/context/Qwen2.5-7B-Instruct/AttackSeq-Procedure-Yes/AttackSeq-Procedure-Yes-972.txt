### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used various methods, including weaponized RTF files, archive files, and direct delivery via an executable.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:** The Aria-body backdoor gathered detailed system information, including hostname, computer-name, username, domain name, Windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, and public IP.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication, sending collected data to the C&C domain.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after the Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, it is likely to proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention creating/deleting files or taking screenshots as part of the Collection phase. However, the Aria-body backdoor is described as a versatile backdoor that includes modules for USB data gathering, keylogging, reverse socks proxy, and loading extensions. These functionalities suggest that the backdoor is capable of performing a wide range of data collection activities.
   - The Discovery phase is specifically mentioned as gathering detailed system information, but the question is asking about the Collection phase, which is typically associated with data exfiltration and other data collection activities.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed functionalities of the Aria-body backdoor and the nature of the Collection phase, it is highly likely that the backdoor would proceed to perform additional data collection activities such as creating/deleting files and taking screenshots.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
