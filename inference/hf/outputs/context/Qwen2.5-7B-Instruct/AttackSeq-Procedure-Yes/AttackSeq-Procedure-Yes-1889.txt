### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries and third-party tools for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for gathering information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery, FIN13 is likely to use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation before employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ProcDump:** Not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **Mimikatz:** Not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **certutil:** Mentioned in the CTI outline under Defense Evasion as a utility used for detection evasion.
   - **WMI and BUSTEDPIPE:** Mentioned in the CTI outline under Lateral Movement.

4. **Contextual Information:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention ProcDump or Mimikatz.
   - certutil is mentioned but in the context of evasion, not privilege escalation.
   - WMI and BUSTEDPIPE are explicitly mentioned for lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align with the information provided. FIN13 does not use ProcDump, Mimikatz, or certutil for privilege escalation as per the given context. Instead, they use WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
