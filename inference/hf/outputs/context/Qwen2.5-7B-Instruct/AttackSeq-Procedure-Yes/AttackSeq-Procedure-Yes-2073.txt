### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails containing a dropper.
   - **Execution:** Loader Trojan.Vcrodat uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs.
   - **Persistence:** Uses tools like a simple remote shell and Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit) for ongoing control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Exploits CVE-2016-0051 and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses search order hijacking and custom malware.
   - **Credential Access:** Relies on Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Maps the network and infects further computers.
   - **Collection:** Steals sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** Configures multiple C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates large volumes of information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after mapping the network and infecting further computers, Whitefly is likely to compromise additional machines using stolen credentials before targeting desired data to expand their control within the organization.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Whitefly heavily relies on tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials. This indicates that credential access is a critical step in their attack sequence.
   - The discovery phase involves mapping the network and infecting further computers, which aligns with the question's context.
   - After gaining access to additional machines, the next logical step would be to use the stolen credentials to compromise more machines and expand their control within the organization.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, which explicitly mentions the use of Mimikatz for credential harvesting and the need to expand control within the organization, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Whitefly will indeed compromise additional machines using stolen credentials before targeting desired data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
