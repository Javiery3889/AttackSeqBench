Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** MuddyWater uses compromised servers in Pakistan and China to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Leveraging Vulnerabilities:** The CTI outline mentions the use of CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office vulnerability, in conjunction with documents resembling official documents from the regional government of Kurdistan and unofficial documents from countries surrounding Iran.
   - **Targeting:** The group targets governmental entities and the telecommunication sector.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if MuddyWater is likely to leverage CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector after using C2 servers in Pakistan and China.
