### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
   - **Execution:** Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Gathered detailed information about the victim's system.
   - **Collection:** Collected a wide range of data from the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with a C&C server using encrypted messages.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the backdoor is likely to shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any actions that would cause the victim's computer to shut down. The focus is on gaining access, maintaining persistence, evading detection, and exfiltrating data.
   - The backdoor's primary function, as described, is to collect and exfiltrate data. There is no indication that it would perform any disruptive actions like shutting down the system.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed CTI outline, the backdoor's primary function is data collection and exfiltration, and there is no mention of any disruptive actions such as shutting down the victim's computer. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
