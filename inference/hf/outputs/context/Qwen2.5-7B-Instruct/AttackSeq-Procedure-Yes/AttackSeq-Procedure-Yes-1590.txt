Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 is delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a legitimate Microsoft executable to sideload a malicious DLL.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 sets up persistence through registry keys and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware customizes its installation to avoid detection by 24 security products and uses multi-stage installation with checks.
   - **Command and Control:** T9000 communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol and supports proxy usage.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrates various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives, compresses, encrypts, and stores or sends the data to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000, after evading detection, is likely to target Skype users and automatically capture data such as files from removable media, and steal sensitive files before exfiltrating this data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that T9000 exfiltrates various types of data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives.
   - The malware is designed to evade detection and avoid analysis by security products, which aligns with the evasion techniques mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The exfiltration process involves compressing, encrypting, and sending the data to the C2 server, which is consistent with the described behavior.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the CTI outline, T9000 does indeed target Skype users and automatically captures data such as files from removable media, and steals sensitive files before exfiltrating this data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A"
