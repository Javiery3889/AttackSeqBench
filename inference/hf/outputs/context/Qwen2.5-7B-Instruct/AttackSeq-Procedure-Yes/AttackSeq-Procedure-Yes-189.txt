Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
2. **Persistence**: The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware inherits root privileges.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware decompresses executables and checks if it is executed by init.
5. **Credential Access**: The malware scrapes credentials and key information.
6. **Discovery**: The netd component enumerates directories, gathers system information, and performs IP scanning.
7. **Command and Control**: The malware provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service.
8. **Exfiltration**: Files are exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the discovery phase, the netd component is likely to automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the netd component performs discovery by enumerating directories and gathering system information.
- The question specifically asks about the collection phase, which is not explicitly detailed in the CTI outline. However, the outline does mention that the malware exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
- The question implies a specific action (collecting files based on a predefined list of file extensions) that is not directly stated in the CTI outline but is a plausible next step after discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the netd component collects files based on a predefined list of file extensions.
- However, the malware's exfiltration phase involves transferring files, which suggests that the malware has the capability to collect files.
- The question is asking about a specific action (file collection based on file extensions) that is not explicitly mentioned but is a logical next step after discovery.

Given the context and the plausible nature of the action, the most plausible answer is that the malware would likely perform such an action.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
