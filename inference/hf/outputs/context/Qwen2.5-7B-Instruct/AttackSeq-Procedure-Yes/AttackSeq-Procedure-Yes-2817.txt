### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI outline describes that the spyware was delivered via spearphishing emails with PDF files disguised as executables.
   - **Command and Control:** The outline mentions several C&C servers used for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the authors used VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection before establishing communication with the C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of VMProtect or any obfuscation techniques.
   - The outline focuses on the initial access method (spearphishing with disguised PDF files) and the C&C infrastructure.
   - VMProtect is a commercial software protection tool that can be used to obfuscate and protect executables, making them harder to analyze and detect.
   - While the use of obfuscation techniques is a common practice in malware to evade detection, the CTI outline does not provide any direct evidence or mention of VMProtect.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of VMProtect or any obfuscation techniques. Therefore, it is not supported by the given context to conclude that the authors used VMProtect for obfuscation.

**Final Answer: B: No**
