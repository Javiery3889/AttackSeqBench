Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Persistence:** They use various methods, including deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if, after using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, FIN13 is likely to use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Invoke-WMIExec:** This tool is used for remote execution of commands via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Custom Web Shells (e.g., BUSTEDPIPE):** These are used for remote access and command execution, often for pivoting within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE, but it does mention the use of custom web shells and persistence methods, which can be used for lateral movement.
   - **Data Collection:** The CTI outline states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely, which aligns with the question's final step.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - FIN13 is known for using custom tools and methods for extended intrusions, which includes persistence and lateral movement.
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE, the use of custom web shells and persistence methods suggests that FIN13 could employ similar techniques for lateral movement.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question (reconnaissance, lateral movement, data collection) is plausible given FIN13's known methods and objectives.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the known methods of FIN13, it is reasonable to assume that they would use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells for lateral movement before collecting data for their fraudulent transactions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
