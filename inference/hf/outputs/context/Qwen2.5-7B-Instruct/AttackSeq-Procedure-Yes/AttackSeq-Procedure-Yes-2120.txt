### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Use of DESLoader for executing various payloads, including fileless RATs.
   - **Persistence:** Registration of scheduled tasks to load DESLoader.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Sophisticated techniques like fileless implants, DLL side-loading, and removal of event logs.
   - **Credential Access:** Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using administrator accounts to deploy RDP and tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Utilization of RDP for moving laterally within the network, targeting servers.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting, using IP addresses over domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader, the A41APT attackers are likely to perform software discovery using WMIC before heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement to target additional servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of WMIC for software discovery. However, it does mention that the attackers perform internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports and use tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` to dump credentials.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline suggests a methodical approach to gaining access and moving laterally, but it does not include a specific mention of using WMIC for software discovery.
   - The question asks about a specific step (WMIC for software discovery) that is not directly supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the use of WMIC for software discovery. The outline focuses more on the use of tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` for credential access and does not mention WMIC. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of WMIC for software discovery.

**Final Answer: B: No**
