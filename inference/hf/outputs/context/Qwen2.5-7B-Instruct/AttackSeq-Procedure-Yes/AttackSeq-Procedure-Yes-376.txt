### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - **Execution:** The BBSRAT malware is executed, and it performs various actions to establish persistence and C2 communication.
   - **Persistence:** The malware writes a registry key to ensure it runs on startup and uses a downloader to deploy a DLL.
   - **Command and Control:** The CTI report details that BBSRAT communicates with C2 servers using HTTP or HTTPS requests and exfiltrates data via POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after BBSRAT has established C2 communication and exfiltrated data via POST requests, it is likely to observe the malware exfiltrating additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that BBSRAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests and exfiltrates data via POST requests.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of additional compressed and encrypted data being exfiltrated via POST requests, which aligns with the described behavior of BBSRAT.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed description in the CTI outline, the malware BBSRAT is known to exfiltrate data via POST requests to the C2 server. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would continue to exfiltrate additional data in a similar manner.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
