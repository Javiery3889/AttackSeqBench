Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations in Turkey.
2. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) are used.
3. **Execution**: The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document and downloads and executes from a specific URL.
4. **Persistence**: The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on the victim's network.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The implant is designed to evade detection and can perform destructive actions like wiping files.
6. **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers, which are disguised as Chinese-language online gambling sites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of tools and resources to be used in future attacks. The CTI outline mentions that the Bankshot implant is designed to persist and evade detection, which aligns with the development of tools for future use.
- **Full Control and Wiping Files**: The CTI outline explicitly states that the Bankshot implant is designed to persist and can perform destructive actions like wiping files. This indicates that the implant is capable of giving attackers full control over the victim system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Bankshot implant is designed to persist and can perform destructive actions, which aligns with the development of tools for future use.
- The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with the capability to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files. Given the information provided, the Bankshot implant is explicitly designed to do exactly that.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
