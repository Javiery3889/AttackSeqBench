Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect systems.
- **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
- **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives based on specific patterns.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
- **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to export certificates and associated private keys from the system store for credential access before searching for files on network and hard drives based on specific patterns for discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to exporting certificates or private keys.
- The outline focuses on persistence, file discovery, and data collection but does not include any steps related to credential access or certificate export.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about CosmicDuke exporting certificates or private keys.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the outline does not include any steps related to credential access or certificate export.
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to perform these actions before the discovery phase, but the outline does not support this claim.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke does not perform these actions as part of its known TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
