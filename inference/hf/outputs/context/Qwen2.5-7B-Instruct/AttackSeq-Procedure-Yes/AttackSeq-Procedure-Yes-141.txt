### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report describes the exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions the use of malicious HWP files to target specific professions or groups, often impersonating government inquiries or job-related documents.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files, attackers are likely to shift their methods by using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of EPS files or simplified PostScript syntax for defense evasion.
   - The outline focuses on the use of HWP files for initial access and collection, targeting specific professions or groups.
   - The question introduces a new method (simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files) that is not directly supported by the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the shift in methods to use EPS files for defense evasion.
   - The outline does not mention any changes in the attack methods beyond the use of HWP files for initial access and collection.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: B: No
