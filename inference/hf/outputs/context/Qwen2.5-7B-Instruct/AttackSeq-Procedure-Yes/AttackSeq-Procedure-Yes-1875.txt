### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 uses custom passive backdoors and tools for extended periods within victim environments.
   - **Persistence:** Uses various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Utilizes common techniques like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employs stealthy methods such as using passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for detection evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS process memory dumping and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies and application layer protocols for C2.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 is likely to exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE:** These are tools used for privilege escalation and command execution, respectively.
   - **Initial Access:** The question asks about initial access, which is typically covered in the "Execution" and "Persistence" stages.
   - **Web Shells:** The CTI outline mentions the use of web shells for lateral movement and command execution, but not for initial access.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This would imply that after using ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 would then use web shells for initial access, which is not supported by the CTI outline.
   - **B: No** - This aligns with the CTI outline, which does not indicate that FIN13 uses web shells for initial access after these specific tools.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
