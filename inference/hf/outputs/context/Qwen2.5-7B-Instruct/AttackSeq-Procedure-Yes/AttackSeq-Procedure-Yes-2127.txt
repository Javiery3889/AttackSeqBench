Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
2. **Execution**: Various scripts are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'resolve.dns', 'stopedge.bat', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'versioninfo.bat', and 'resolvedns.bat'.
3. **Persistence**: 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes for persistence.
4. **Discovery**: 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details such as directory listings and running processes.
5. **Collection**: 'versioninfo.bat' collects information and prepares it for exfiltration.
6. **Command and Control**: 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with the C2 server.
7. **Exfiltration**: 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrates data through a POST request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' for persistence, the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR, to evade detection and before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Context from CTI Outline**: The CTI outline mentions that the scripts are deobfuscated, which implies that they are not heavily obfuscated. The 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' scripts are deobfuscated to execute other scripts.
- **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the CTI outline, but the question specifically asks about the obfuscation of scripts and the timing relative to 'versioninfo.bat'.
- **Obfuscation**: The CTI outline does not mention the use of XOR or other heavy obfuscation techniques. The scripts are described as being deobfuscated, which suggests they are not heavily obfuscated.
- **Timing**: 'versioninfo.bat' is mentioned as discovering system details, which occurs after the persistence mechanism is established by 'stopedge.bat' scheduling 'install.vbs'.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not indicate the use of heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR.
- The scripts are described as being deobfuscated, which is the opposite of heavily obfuscated.
- The timing of the scripts does not suggest the use of heavy obfuscation before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.

**Final Answer: B: No**
