Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Resource Development**: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
- **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
- **Execution**: Use of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
- **Persistence**: Creation of registry Run key entry and installation as a service.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
- **Defense Evasion**: Injection of encrypted shellcode into processes, adjustment of token privileges, and obfuscation of files.
- **Credential Access**: Use of a custom Mimikatz version.
- **Discovery**: Collection of system information.
- **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control after exploiting vulnerabilities and executing SparrowDoor.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.
- However, the context of the SparrowDoor backdoor and the nature of the attack suggest that encrypted communication is a common practice to evade detection and maintain stealth.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The attack sequence starts with exploiting vulnerabilities and executing SparrowDoor.
2. **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: The group employs various techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, which often include encrypted communication.
3. **Command and Control**: Given the nature of the SparrowDoor backdoor and the need for stealth, it is highly plausible that the C&C communication would be encrypted to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
