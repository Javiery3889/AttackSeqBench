### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages to Instagram users, particularly influencers. These messages contained generic greetings and claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites.
   - **Credential Access:** After obtaining the credentials, the attackers changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners. They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments after collecting Instagram credentials and locking out the original owners.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any ransom demands. The focus is on the initial access and credential access phases, where the attackers use phishing to obtain credentials and then change the passwords to lock out the original owners.
   - The question introduces a new phase (demanding ransom payments) that is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This answer suggests that the attackers will demand ransom payments, which is not supported by the CTI outline.
   - **B: No** - This answer suggests that the attackers will not demand ransom payments, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
