### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors shifted from spear-phishing to compromising legitimate websites to host their malware.
   - **Persistence:** The Emissary Trojan maintains persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll`, installing as a service, and creating registry keys to store a unique GUID. It also hijacks legitimate services or adds startup code.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trojan communicates with C2 servers using HTTP requests and has hardcoded C2s.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the Emissary Trojan authors are likely to update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the authors' actions to evade detection through recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes.
   - The outline focuses on the methods of initial access, persistence, and command and control, but does not provide information on the authors' specific evasion techniques.
   - The question is asking about a specific evasion technique (recompiling without changing PE header hashes), which is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the likelihood of the Emissary Trojan authors using the specific evasion technique mentioned in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
