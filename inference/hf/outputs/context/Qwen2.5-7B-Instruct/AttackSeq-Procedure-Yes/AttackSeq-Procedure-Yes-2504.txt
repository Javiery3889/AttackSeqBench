Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: APT3 and APT18 used phishing campaigns exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team data leak.
  - APT3's phishing emails contained URLs that redirected to a malicious Adobe Flash file, which downloaded an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload.
  - APT18's phishing emails prompted victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update, which delivered a GH0ST RAT variant.

- **Persistence**: The SHOTPUT payload is a DLL backdoor that communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses.
- The GH0ST RAT variant delivered by APT18 calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether the SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, while the GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **APT3's SHOTPUT Backdoor**: The CTI outline explicitly states that the SHOTPUT payload communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses.
- **APT18's GH0ST RAT**: The CTI outline also explicitly states that the GH0ST RAT variant calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that the SHOTPUT backdoor from APT3 communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses.
- The GH0ST RAT from APT18 communicates with a known APT18 CnC address.
- Both backdoors are described as communicating with different CnC addresses, which aligns with the question's scenario.

Given the information provided, the answer is straightforward based on the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
