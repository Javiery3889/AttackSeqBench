Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious .DOC file that exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop the main module "net.exe".
   - **Persistence:** The malware installs a main C&C module "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" and registers it as a service named "Windowsupdata". It also uses mutexes to prevent multiple instances.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with various C&C servers.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.
   - The specific mutexes mentioned are "SD_2013 Is Running!", "Boat-12 Is Running!", "DocHunter2012 Is Running!", and "NetTravler Is Running!".

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any encryption or obfuscation techniques used by the malware to protect its C&C servers.
   - The mutexes mentioned are used to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running simultaneously, which is a form of persistence mechanism.
   - There is no information provided about the malware using encryption or decryption to obfuscate its configuration or C&C servers.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the NetTraveler malware uses a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.

**Final Answer: B: No**
