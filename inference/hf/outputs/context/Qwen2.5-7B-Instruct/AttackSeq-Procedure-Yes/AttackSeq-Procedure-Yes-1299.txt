### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spearphishing email containing a hidden Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The document exploits CVE-2017-11882 to silently execute code.
   - **Credential Access:** The PE file (educrety.exe) searches for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys and files.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** Credentials are sent to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is encrypted and exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention hiding files or directories (T1158). The focus is on the execution of the hidden object, credential access, and data collection.
   - T1158 is a technique used to hide files and directories from detection, which is not directly mentioned or implied in the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no explicit mention or implication of the attack using T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) to hide artifacts before searching for and extracting credentials. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
