### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report mentions that ChromeLoader spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension.
   - **Defense Evasion:** DazzleSpy is described as using advanced techniques for evasion and persistence, masquerading as an Apple launch service.
   - **Command and Control:** Operation In(ter)ception is noted for using lures and masquerading as legitimate processes for evasion.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if DazzleSpy and Operation In(ter)ception will install a LaunchAgent in macOS systems for persistence after initial access via malverts and malspam.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **DazzleSpy:** The CTI report explicitly states that DazzleSpy uses advanced techniques for evasion and persistence, masquerading as an Apple launch service. This directly implies that DazzleSpy installs a LaunchAgent for persistence.
   - **Operation In(ter)ception:** The report mentions that Operation In(ter)ception uses lures and masquerades as legitimate processes for evasion. While it does not explicitly mention a LaunchAgent, the use of legitimate processes for evasion suggests a sophisticated approach that could include persistence mechanisms, but it is not as directly stated as DazzleSpy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the direct statement about DazzleSpy using a LaunchAgent for persistence and the more general description of Operation In(ter)ception's evasion techniques, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with DazzleSpy's explicit use of a LaunchAgent.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
