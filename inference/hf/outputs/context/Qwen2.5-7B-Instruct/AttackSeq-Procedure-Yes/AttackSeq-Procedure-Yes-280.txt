Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered via a ZIP file. The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
2. **Execution**: The 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script decodes and executes another base64 encoded PowerShell script from 'sdmc.jpg'. This script downloads a zip file containing four files from a cloud service, which are used to generate the malware payload.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time. They also use image files to conceal the components of the malware payload and sign the final payload with valid certificates to appear trustworthy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using image files to conceal malicious components, the Bandook campaign is likely to use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload and then employ AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention Process Hollowing or any technique involving Internet Explorer.
- The outline focuses on using image files to conceal the components and signing the payload with valid certificates.
- There is no information about using Process Hollowing or AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence of the use of Process Hollowing or AES encryption for communication.
- The techniques mentioned in the outline are related to initial access, execution, and defense evasion, but not to the specific techniques asked in the question.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the Bandook campaign does not use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload and then employ AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
