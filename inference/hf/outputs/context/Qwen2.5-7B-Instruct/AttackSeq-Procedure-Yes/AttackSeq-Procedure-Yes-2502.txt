### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign uses spear-phishing emails with malicious document attachments, often exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0199. These emails contain well-crafted social engineering content and use typo-squatting domains.
   - **Execution:** The malware downloaded are .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator, which unpack to reveal commercial RATs like RevengeRAT. An additional module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTAs). They also sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations after gaining initial access and executing RAT malware like RevengeRAT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the ScreenBooking module captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. This indicates that the attackers are indeed interested in collecting credit card information from OTA websites.
   - The outline also states that the attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies, which aligns with the question.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed analysis of the CTI outline, which explicitly mentions the use of a module (ScreenBooking) to capture credit card data from OTA websites, the most plausible sequence of TTPs supports the likelihood of the attackers collecting credit card information from OTA websites during their operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
