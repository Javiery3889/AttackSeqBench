Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script executed in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The downloaded payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, following the initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with a VBS macro.
- **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The outline mentions that the PowerShell script executed in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
- **Command and Control**: The outline specifies that the PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
- **Impact**: The outline explicitly states that the downloaded payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The campaign used phishing emails with a malicious Word document containing a VBS macro, which is consistent with the question.
2. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell script was executed in memory, which aligns with the question's description of an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Command and Control**: The script communicated with C2 servers to download payloads, which is consistent with the question's description of downloading payloads.
4. **Impact**: The downloaded payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware, which matches the question's description.

Given the detailed sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, the answer is clear and aligns perfectly with the question.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
