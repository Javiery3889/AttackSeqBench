Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The ProjectM actors developed a significant toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs.
2. **Initial Access**: They gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files.
3. **Execution**: The campaign executed malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, and RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok.
4. **Defense Evasion**: They utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal their infrastructure, but lapses revealed an individual's email address.
5. **Command and Control**: The C2 infrastructure included domains registered with or without WHOIS protection, used to host C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan, which delivered further payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention gathering victim identity information as part of reconnaissance efforts.
- The outline does mention the use of spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, which are typically used to deliver initial payloads.
- The outline also mentions the use of Trojans and RATs for execution and defense evasion.
- The outline does not provide any direct evidence of reconnaissance activities focused on gathering victim identity information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the development of tools, initial access methods, execution techniques, and command and control infrastructure.
- There is no explicit mention of reconnaissance activities aimed at gathering victim identity information.
- The question asks about a specific phase (reconnaissance) that is not directly addressed in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the ProjectM actors did not gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
