### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used a malicious JavaScript-based framework called SocGholish to deliver the initial payload.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - **Execution:** The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector.
   - **Discovery:** The outline does not explicitly mention the use of `Get-NetComputer` from PowerView for remote system discovery. However, it does mention the use of PowerShell scripts for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise before using `Get-NetComputer` from PowerView for remote system discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access involved the SocGholish framework, which is a JavaScript-based framework.
   - The execution phase mentions the use of Cobalt Strike and PowerShell scripts for discovery, but it does not specifically mention `Get-NetComputer` from PowerView.
   - The question assumes a sequence where the initial compromise is via SocGholish, followed by the use of `Get-NetComputer` for discovery. However, the CTI outline does not provide evidence for the use of `Get-NetComputer` in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the sequence involving the use of `Get-NetComputer` from PowerView for remote system discovery is not explicitly supported. The outline focuses on the use of SocGholish for initial access and Cobalt Strike for execution and discovery, but does not mention `Get-NetComputer` specifically.

**Final Answer: B: No**
