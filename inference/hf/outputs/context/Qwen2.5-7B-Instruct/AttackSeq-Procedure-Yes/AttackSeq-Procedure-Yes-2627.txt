### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack used spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files.
   - **Execution:** The malware used a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files/directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed obfuscation, packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Targeted credentials by scanning for key and certificate files.
   - **Collection:** Stole clipboard contents, copied files, logged keystrokes, and captured screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:** Used standard FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the same channel used for C&C, with encryption and compression.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete malware is likely to list all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command after gaining initial access via spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific use of the `netsh` command or any network scanning activities.
   - The collection phase involves stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, and capturing screenshots, but there is no indication of network scanning.
   - The malware's primary focus is on data collection and exfiltration, rather than network reconnaissance.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no evidence that Machete malware would list all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command as part of its collection phase. The malware's activities are more focused on data collection and exfiltration rather than network reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B: No**
