### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Welcome Chat app is used to deliver the malware to Android users via a malicious app.
   - **Persistence:** The app auto-starts at device boot by listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects device information and GPS location.
   - **Collection:** The app exfiltrates various types of data, including SMS messages, call logs, contact lists, photos, and GPS locations.
   - **Others:** The app's infrastructure is unsecured, and the data is freely available on an unsecured server. The app uses permissions that are intrusive but may seem natural for a messaging app.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the app is likely to upload exfiltrated data to its C&C server using the HTTP protocol after ensuring persistence and discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the protocol used for exfiltrating data. However, it does state that the app's infrastructure is unsecured and that the data is freely available on an unsecured server.
   - HTTP is a common and unsecured protocol often used for data exfiltration due to its simplicity and wide availability.
   - Given the unsecured nature of the app's infrastructure, it is plausible that the app uses HTTP for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Based on the unsecured nature of the app's infrastructure and the common use of HTTP for data exfiltration, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the app likely uses HTTP to upload exfiltrated data to its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
