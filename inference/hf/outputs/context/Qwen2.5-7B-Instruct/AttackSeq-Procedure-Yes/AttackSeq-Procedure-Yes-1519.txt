### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** A malspam campaign using a lure PDF with an embedded RTF file that triggers an HTA file containing encoded PowerShell commands.
   - **Execution:** The PowerShell command downloads and executes ComboJack malware.
   - **Persistence:** 
     - ComboJack copies itself to a system location.
     - It uses `attrib.exe` to set hidden and system attributes, ensuring it executes with SYSTEM level privileges.
     - A registry key is set to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses `attrib.exe` to hide itself.
   - **Impact:** The malware alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if ComboJack will enter an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information before replacing them with a hardcoded wallet address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention an infinite loop or a specific mechanism for continuously checking clipboard contents.
   - The malware's primary function, as described, is to alter clipboard contents to redirect funds to the attacker.
   - The persistence and defense evasion mechanisms are described but do not indicate any continuous monitoring or loop behavior.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no indication that ComboJack enters an infinite loop to check clipboard contents. The malware's primary function is to alter clipboard contents once, not continuously monitor them.

**Final Answer: B: No**
