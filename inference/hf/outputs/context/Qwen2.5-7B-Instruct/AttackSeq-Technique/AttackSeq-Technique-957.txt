Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Chrome browser to gain initial access.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The attackers then used two zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to escalate privileges and inject malware into the system process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique used to download and transfer the Dropper module to the compromised system before the Remote shell module communicated with a C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection. It is not directly related to the initial download and transfer of the Dropper module.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. It fits the context of downloading and transferring the Dropper module.
- **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves using vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges. While it is part of the attack, it is not the technique used for the initial download and transfer of the Dropper module.
- **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data. It is not relevant to the initial download and transfer of the Dropper module.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access involved exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Chrome to gain initial access.
- The privilege escalation involved using two zero-day vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.
- The question asks about the technique used to download and transfer the Dropper module, which is a tool transfer activity.
- Among the given options, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant and plausible technique for downloading and transferring the Dropper module.

### Final Answer: B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
