Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
2. **Execution**: Running commands and uploading tools.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Using custom Mimikatz and Dumpert to evade detection.
4. **Credential Access**: Using Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket for pass-the-hash.
5. **Discovery**: Running commands for initial discovery.
6. **Command and Control**: Using AntSword webshell for C2 communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred after gaining credential access through Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks. The context is using webshells and dumping credentials to execute commands on other systems within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email addresses from local systems. It does not align with the context of using webshells and dumping credentials to execute commands.
- **T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or hide malicious activity. While it is a valid TTP, it does not directly relate to the use of webshells and dumping credentials.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a system. It could be relevant if the actors were using remote services to execute commands, but the context is more about using webshells.
- **T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services to gain access to a system. It is not relevant to the context of using webshells and dumping credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actors used webshells (AntSword) to execute commands on other systems within the network.
- They also used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket for pass-the-hash to run commands on other systems.
- The most relevant TTP in this context is the use of webshells to execute commands, which aligns with the **T1021-Remote Services** technique.

### Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
