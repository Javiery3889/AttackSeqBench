Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Use of DESLoader to execute payloads.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks to load DESLoader.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Sophisticated techniques including fileless implants and removal of event logs.
   - **Credential Access:** Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using stolen credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers.
   - The key point here is "before the attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email content from remote systems. It is not directly related to the deployment of RDP or lateral movement.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it is a part of the execution phase, it is not specifically related to the deployment of RDP.
   - **T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves establishing a connection to a remote service. Deploying RDP to target servers is a form of establishing a remote service connection.
   - **T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique involves using cloud services for remote access. It is not directly related to the deployment of RDP to target servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first gained initial access and then performed credential access and discovery activities.
   - After discovering open RDP and SMB ports, they used stolen credentials to deploy RDP to target servers, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - The technique that directly precedes the deployment of RDP to target servers is the use of remote services, which in this context is the deployment of RDP.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
