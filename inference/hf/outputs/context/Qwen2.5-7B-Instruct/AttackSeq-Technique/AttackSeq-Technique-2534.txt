Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack involved distributing LURK malware through password-protected Microsoft Office files.
   - **Execution:** The malware connects to a command-and-control server at `dtl.dnsd.me:63` and `dtl.eatuo.com:63`.
   - **Persistence:** The malware creates a link in the Startup folder and uses additional files for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used password-protected Office documents to evade detection.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware maintained persistence and communicated with its command-and-control server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. While the malware used password-protected Office documents, this technique is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. Again, this is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. The malware connects to `dtl.dnsd.me:63` and `dtl.eatuo.com:63`, which indicates the use of application layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication.
   - **T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:** This technique involves flooding the target system with traffic to exhaust resources. This is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most relevant ATT&CK technique for the communication with the C2 server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
