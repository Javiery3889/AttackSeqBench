Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used various methods, including weaponized RTF files, archive files, and direct delivery.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, decrypting configuration data, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:** The Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information, including host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, etc.
   - **Command and Control:** The group used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the Collection phase after the Discovery phase, where the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. It is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes. While this could be part of the collection process, it is not the most likely technique given the context of gathering system information.
   - **T1564.002-Hidden Users:** This technique involves creating or modifying hidden users on the system. This is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and listing running processes. Given that the Aria-body backdoor gathered information about active processes, this technique aligns well with the collection of system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information, including active processes.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for gathering information about active processes is T1057-Process Discovery.
   - None of the other techniques (Screen Capture, Input Capture, Hidden Users) are as directly related to the collection of system information as T1057-Process Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery**
