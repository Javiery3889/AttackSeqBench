Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
- **Initial Access**: T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Execution**: The malware sideloaded a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, into the igfxtray.exe process.
- **Persistence**: The malware used three techniques for persistence, including setting registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It does not pertain to ensuring persistence across reboots.
- **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. It is not related to ensuring persistence across reboots.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malware runs or loads with every user mode process spawned, including at system boot or logon. This aligns with the persistence mechanism described in the CTI outline.
- **T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to run at system boot or logon. While it is related to persistence, it is more about creating new processes rather than ensuring existing processes load automatically.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that T9000 used three techniques for persistence, including setting registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.
- Setting registry keys and injecting libraries into explorer.exe are methods to ensure that the malware runs or loads with every user mode process spawned, including at system boot or logon.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that aligns with the described persistence mechanism.

### Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
