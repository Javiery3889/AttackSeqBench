Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Attackers used malicious RTF files, self-extracting Windows executables, and RAR archives.
   - **Execution:** Scote malware provides backdoor access and collects C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information, including Pastebin and Google+.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+ after the malware was loaded onto the victim machine.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files:** This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding information within other files or data, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with C2 servers, which aligns with the use of Pastebin and Google+ for C2 information.

Given the context that the malware uses legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin and Google+) to host its C2 information, the most plausible technique for facilitating the communication with C2 servers is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
