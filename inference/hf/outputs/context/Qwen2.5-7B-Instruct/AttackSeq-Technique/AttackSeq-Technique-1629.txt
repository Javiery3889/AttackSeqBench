Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted documents and malicious iFrames.
   - Discovery: APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - Persistence: Ensures persistence by changing file timestamps.
   - Privilege Escalation: Uses a privilege escalation tool.
   - Defense Evasion: Evades defenses by changing file timestamps and using a proxy tool.
   - Credential Access: Deploys a password dumping tool.
   - Collection: Collects data using various modules.
   - Command and Control: Communicates with C&C servers.
   - Exfiltration: Exfiltrates data to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after bots geographically distributed across different countries scanned IP ranges and identified vulnerable systems.
   - The bots scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems aligns with the "Discovery" phase in the CTI outline.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1564.003-Hidden Window:** This technique involves hiding windows to evade detection. It does not fit the context of scanning IP ranges and identifying systems.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify systems that can be exploited. This aligns with the bots scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves modifying system services to maintain persistence or evade detection. It does not fit the context of scanning IP ranges.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This is the same as T1595-Active Scanning, which is the correct technique for the described activity.

**Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning**
