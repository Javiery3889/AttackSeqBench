Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
2. **Execution**: Fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads.
3. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Using Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Exploiting DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
6. **Credential Access**: Harvesting credentials using Mimikatz.
7. **Discovery**: Lateral movement and infecting new machines.
8. **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and DNS Tunneling.
9. **Exfiltration**: Using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook for data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that facilitated the OceanLotus Group's expansion within the network after harvesting credentials and before using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique is not relevant to the context of the question, as it pertains to making systems more accessible to users, not to network expansion.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the network expansion phase.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate, which could be relevant to the use of stolen credentials but is not specifically about the network expansion phase.
- **T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which is not relevant to the context of the question.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The CTI outline indicates that after harvesting credentials, the OceanLotus Group would likely use these credentials to perform lateral movement and infect new machines. This process is described in the "Discovery" phase, which involves moving laterally within the network and infecting new machines.

Given the options, the most plausible technique that facilitates the OceanLotus Group's expansion within the network after harvesting credentials is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**, as it involves using the stolen credentials to authenticate and access new systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
