Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack used a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with ZxShell malware.
   - **C2 Infrastructure:** The malware connected to the domain `oa.ameteksen.com` as part of its C2 infrastructure.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to establish connections to the C2 infrastructure at `oa.ameteksen.com` after the initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with C2 infrastructure. This is a plausible technique for establishing connections to C2 servers.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique involves hiding the C2 infrastructure to avoid detection. While it could be used, the question specifically asks about the technique used to establish connections, not to hide them.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves infecting a user's system through a web page. This is not relevant to the question as it already mentions the initial access and subsequent C2 connection.
   - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate with C2 infrastructure. While this is a specific type of application layer protocol, it is not as general as T1071.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack used a zero-day exploit to infect victims with ZxShell malware.
   - The malware then established a connection to `oa.ameteksen.com` for C2 communication.
   - The most general and applicable technique for establishing this connection would be an application layer protocol, which is covered by T1071.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
