Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Execution:** Custom loader to execute Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Establishes persistence by creating hidden directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Collects system information including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, and network details.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with C&C servers using a custom protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data via the same custom protocol.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that enables the malware to access and collect data from shared resources within the target's network after gathering system information and network details.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1555.002-Securityd Memory:** This technique involves accessing memory of security-related processes, which is not directly related to accessing shared resources.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information to understand the network and system, which aligns with the information collected in the CTI outline.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives, which is relevant to the question.
   - **T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves accessing data from configuration repositories, which is not directly related to shared resources.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the malware has already gathered system and network information. The next logical step would be to access and collect data from shared resources within the target's network. Among the given options, **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** is the most relevant and plausible technique for this purpose.

**Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
