Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a series of TTPs used by FIN13, a cybercriminal threat actor. The relevant TTPs for lateral movement and information gathering are:
- **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally.
- **Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that most likely occurred after using WMI to execute commands remotely for lateral movement to gather information on network configuration and support FIN13's operational objectives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **WMI (Remote Command Execution)**: This is a method of lateral movement.
- **System Network Configuration Discovery**: This TTP involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the question's requirement to gather information on network configuration.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This TTP involves discovering internet connections, which is not directly related to gathering network configuration information.
- **B: T1505-Server Software Component**: This TTP involves identifying server software components, which is not directly related to network configuration.
- **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This TTP involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the question's requirement.
- **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This TTP involves identifying default accounts, which is not directly related to network configuration.

### Step 5: Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the question's requirement to gather information on network configuration after using WMI for lateral movement is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C**
