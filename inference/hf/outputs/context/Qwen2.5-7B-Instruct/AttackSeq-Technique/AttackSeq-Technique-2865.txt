Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Suckfly used a backdoor (Nidiran) and hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts.
   - **Execution:** Nidiran backdoor and hacktools were used.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Malware checks for internet connection and communicates over specific ports.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a signed credential-dumping tool.
   - **Discovery:** Scanned for open ports 8080, 5900, and 40.
   - **Command and Control:** Nidiran backdoor communicated with C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data using the Nidiran backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network after scanning for open ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a session to gain unauthorized access to a remote service. It is not directly related to scanning for open ports.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a service to gain access. It could be relevant if Suckfly found a service running on the open ports and exploited it.
   - **T1558.003-Kerberoasting:** This technique involves obtaining service account tickets to crack the service account passwords. It is not directly related to scanning for open ports.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application. It could be relevant if Suckfly found a vulnerable application on the open ports and exploited it.

Given the context of scanning for open ports (8080, 5900, and 40) to expand its foothold, the most plausible technique would be **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**. This technique aligns with the idea of finding and exploiting services running on the discovered open ports.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
