Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: APT41 conducted reconnaissance targeting call records and hotel reservation systems.
2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with .chm attachments were used.
3. **Execution**: Various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits, were deployed.
4. **Persistence**: Rootkits and MBR bootkits were used to maintain persistence.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Bootkits were used for defense evasion.
6. **Credential Access**: Credential stealers and keyloggers were used to access credentials.
7. **Discovery**: APT41 moved laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.
8. **Collection**: Source code and digital certificates were collected from game production environments.
9. **Impact**: APT41 manipulated virtual currencies and attempted to deploy ransomware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates after discovering and accessing game production environments through lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook. It is unlikely to occur before collecting source code and digital certificates.
- **T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using a hash of a password to authenticate without needing the actual password. It is not directly related to the collection of source code and digital certificates.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain access to systems. It is not relevant to the collection of source code and digital certificates.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. It is plausible that APT41 used remote services to move laterally and access game production environments, which would precede the collection of source code and digital certificates.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that APT41 moved laterally within networks to discover and access game production environments.
- The question specifies that the technique occurred before the collection of source code and digital certificates.
- Among the given options, T1021-Remote Services is the most plausible technique that would be used to move laterally and access the game production environments.

### Final Answer: D: T1021-Remote Services
