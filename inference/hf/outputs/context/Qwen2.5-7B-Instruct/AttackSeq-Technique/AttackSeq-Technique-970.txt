Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the attack sequence as follows:
1. **Initial Access**: The Naikon APT group used various methods, including weaponized RTF files, archive files, and direct delivery.
2. **Execution**: The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
5. **Collection**: The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to gather various types of data, including host and network information, installed software, and more.
6. **Command and Control**: The group used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software as part of the discovery phase. The answer choices are:
A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups
C: T1518-Software Discovery
D: T1113-Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. It is not directly related to the discovery phase of installed software.
- **T1069.003-Cloud Groups**: This technique involves using cloud services to manage groups. It is not relevant to the discovery phase of installed software.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system. This is directly related to the discovery phase of installed software.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be used for reconnaissance, it is not specifically related to the discovery phase of installed software.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the Aria-body backdoor's capabilities to gather various types of data, including host and network information, installed software, and more.
- The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software.
- Among the given choices, T1518-Software Discovery is the most relevant to the discovery phase of installed software.

### Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery
