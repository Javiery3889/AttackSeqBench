Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a spearphishing email containing a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
- **Execution**: The hidden object in the Excel document allows silent code execution.
- **Credential Access**: The dropped PE file searches for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys.
- **Collection**: Data is collected from the local system.
- **Command and Control**: Credentials are sent to a command and control server.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is encrypted and exfiltrated.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that most likely involved evading detection by concealing malicious activities after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before credential access techniques.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1110.003-Password Spraying**
  - This technique involves using a list of common or stolen credentials to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to evading detection.
- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for command and control. It does not directly relate to evading detection.
- **Answer Choice C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
  - This technique involves hiding files or directories to avoid detection. This could be relevant as the hidden object in the Excel document is a form of hiding.
- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This is a broader and more relevant technique to the context of hiding malicious activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The hidden object in the Excel document is a form of hiding malicious activities, which aligns with the concept of hiding artifacts.
- The technique T1564-Hide Artifacts (D) is the most comprehensive and directly relevant to the context of hiding malicious activities to evade detection.

### Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
