Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to set up remote tunneling.
   - **Execution:** The 64-bit backdoor was deployed using scripts and encrypted files, and a PowerShell loader based on the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection module was used to inject the final payload into memory.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like pscan and nmap were used for network service scanning.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the use of pscan and nmap for network service scanning.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The execution phase mentions the use of scripts and PowerShell loaders to inject payloads into memory.
   - The discovery phase mentions the use of pscan and nmap for network service scanning.
   - We need to find a technique that logically precedes the use of pscan and nmap.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding from files or information. While it could be part of the process, it is not directly related to the network scanning activities.
   - **B: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job:** This technique is not relevant to the context of the CostaRicto Campaign as it pertains to container orchestration, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data, which is the opposite of what is needed before network scanning. It is unlikely to be the correct answer.
   - **D: T1218.013-Mavinject:** This technique involves injecting code into a process using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. While it is related to execution, it is not directly related to the network scanning activities.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the execution phase, where scripts and PowerShell loaders are used to inject payloads into memory, followed by the discovery phase where network service scanning tools like pscan and nmap are used.

**Final Answer: D: T1218.013-Mavinject** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs as it aligns with the execution phase and is a technique that could be used to inject code into a process, which is a step that logically precedes network service scanning.
