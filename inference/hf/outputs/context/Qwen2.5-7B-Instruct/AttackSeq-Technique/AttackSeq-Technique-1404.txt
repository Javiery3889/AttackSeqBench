Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack uses spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.
- **Execution**: The malware (TidePool) gathers information and sends it to the C2 server via HTTP.
- **Persistence**: The malware uses an ActiveSetup registry key to ensure it launches on boot.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware modifies the registry to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after initial access and persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to exfiltrate data or communicate with a C2 server. The CTI outline mentions that the malware gathers information and sends it to the C2 server via HTTP, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves using legitimate system features to gain elevated privileges. The CTI outline does not mention any abuse of elevation control mechanisms for communication.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. The CTI outline already covers the initial access via spear phishing, so this is not relevant for the communication phase.
- **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to exfiltrate data or communicate with a C2 server. The CTI outline does not mention the use of an internal proxy for communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware gathers information and sends it to the C2 server via HTTP. This directly aligns with the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique.
- The other techniques do not match the described communication method.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
