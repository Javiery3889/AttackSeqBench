Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The malware infection process starts with a malicious document that contains a script.
   - This script downloads a base64-encoded text file (1.txt), which is then decoded to create and execute a batch file (1.bat).
   - The batch file downloads additional text files (2.txt or 3.txt) that are decoded to create a 'setup.cab' file.
   - The CAB file contains various files, including a BAT file for executing the main payload, an INI file with the attacker server address, a DLL file for UAC bypass, and the main EXE payload.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated the delivery of the malicious documents to victim organizations before the multi-step process using batch files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves adding malicious components to legitimate software. It does not fit the context of delivering malicious documents.
   - **T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. It is not relevant to the delivery of documents.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves using legitimate mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. It does not fit the context of delivering documents.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using deceptive emails or messages to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files. This fits the context of delivering malicious documents to victim organizations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the initial infection vector is a malicious document that contains a script.
   - The script is designed to download and execute additional files, which is a common technique used in phishing attacks.
   - Phishing is a well-known method for delivering malicious documents to victim organizations, often through deceptive emails or messages.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
