Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing using legitimate-looking documents.
   - **Execution:** Downloader installed the backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed obfuscation, packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Targeted credentials by scanning for key and certificate files.
   - **Discovery:** Conducted network and system discovery.
   - **Collection:** Staged data in a temporary folder, encrypted, and prepared for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data to remote servers, encrypted, and compressed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitates communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports after the data has been collected and staged.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Machete exfiltrated data over the same channel used for C&C, and scheduled transfers were set up to send data to the C&C server every 10 minutes.
   - The question specifies that the data is exfiltrated over FTP and HTTP ports, which are application layer protocols.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery** - This technique is about discovering and using peripheral devices, which is not relevant to the exfiltration over FTP and HTTP.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data, which is already mentioned in the CTI outline (data was encrypted with AES and base64 encoded). This is not the technique that facilitates the communication itself.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container** - This technique is about deploying containers, which is not relevant to the exfiltration over FTP and HTTP.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols (like FTP and HTTP) for communication, which aligns with the question's requirement.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
