Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The rootkit is distributed via the RIG Exploit kit.
   - **Persistence:** The rootkit drops a driver (houzi.sys) in the \Windows\Temp directory and registers it to start on boot.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The driver is designed to evade detection and hide from security products.
   - **Collection:** The rootkit gathers browsing data.
   - **Communication:** The rootkit connects to one of two hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for the rootkit to establish communication with its C&C domains to download the homepage configuration after collecting browsing data.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software:** This technique is not relevant to malware communication with C&C servers.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique is about controlling traffic flow, which is not relevant to malware communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control. This aligns with the rootkit downloading the homepage configuration from the C&C server.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves infecting a user's system through a malicious website. It is not relevant to the communication phase after initial infection.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the rootkit is communicating with its C&C server to download the homepage configuration, which is a form of establishing command and control using application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
