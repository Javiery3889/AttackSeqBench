Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails containing a dropper.
   - **Execution:** The dropper executes a loader named Trojan.Vcrodat.
   - **Persistence:** Tools like a simple remote shell and Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit) are used.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Exploits a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) and uses Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses search order hijacking and custom malware.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Maps the network and infects further computers.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Compromises additional machines using stolen credentials.
   - **Collection:** Steals sensitive information.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitates confidential communication for ongoing command and control after establishing communication with a C&C domain using encrypted payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is focused on the technique that ensures secure and confidential communication for ongoing command and control.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It does not pertain to secure communication.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain command and control communications, which aligns with the question's focus on secure and confidential communication.
   - **T1599-Network Boundary Bridging:** This technique involves establishing a connection between networks. It does not pertain to secure communication.
   - **T1205.002-Socket Filters:** This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It does not pertain to secure communication.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates confidential communication for ongoing command and control is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer: B**
