Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the installer 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe, which places spyware components in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps directory.
- **Execution**: The spyware components, including sysCrt32.exe, are executed. sysCrt32.exe ensures persistence and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours.
- **Persistence**: The spyware adds the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable and sets up scheduled tasks.
- **Credential Access**: libchrome.exe is used to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords.
- **Command and Control**: The C2 servers are hosted on Novinhost, and the malware uses curl.exe to access FTP servers.
- **Exfiltration**: sysUp32.bat collects files and uploads them to the FTP server, including Chrome passwords and crypto-wallet data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves accessing data from a repository, which is not directly related to clipboard contents or keystrokes.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment, which is not relevant to clipboard or keystroke data collection.
- **T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to clipboard or keystroke data collection.
- **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which directly aligns with the process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the spyware components, such as libCache32.exe, libTemp32.exe, and libchrome.exe, are responsible for keylogging and clipboard logging.
- Keylogging and clipboard logging are forms of input capture, which is directly related to the process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.
- Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for this process is T1056-Input Capture.

### Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture
