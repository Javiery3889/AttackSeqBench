Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing campaign using malicious MS Office documents.
- **Execution**: Malicious macros in the MS Office documents instruct victims to disable security controls, allowing the execution of a macro that downloads additional payloads.
- **Defense Evasion**: Use of the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: Connection attempts to a C2 server in Germany.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the Execution tactic involving malicious macros downloading payloads to enable subsequent activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the attacker tricking a user into executing a program. This aligns with the execution of the malicious macro that downloads additional payloads.
- **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While this could be a subsequent activity, it is not directly related to the execution of the malicious macro.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves adding malware to the system's boot process or logon scripts. This is more about persistence and not directly related to the execution of the malicious macro.
- **T1542.005-TFTP Boot**: This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot a system. This is not directly related to the execution of the malicious macro.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malicious macro, after being executed, downloads additional payloads. This action is a form of user execution, as it tricks the user into running the macro and downloading the payloads.
- T1204-User Execution is the most relevant ATT&CK technique that describes the action of the malicious macro executing and downloading additional payloads.

### Final Answer: A: T1204-User Execution
