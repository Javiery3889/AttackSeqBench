Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file with a decoy Word document.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a location based on the user's UID.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor avoids detection and uses custom encryption for communication.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurs after the backdoor has established persistence and is surveying the victim's computer, encrypting the gathered information, and sending it to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems. However, the CTI outline does not mention the backdoor actively discovering remote systems.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's system. The backdoor is described as surveying the victim's computer, which aligns with this technique.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process. The CTI outline does not mention the backdoor modifying the execution flow of other processes.
   - **T1600-Weaken Encryption:** This technique involves weakening encryption to gain access to encrypted data. The CTI outline does not mention the backdoor weakening encryption; it uses custom encryption for communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The backdoor is described as surveying the victim's computer and encrypting the gathered information before sending it to the C2 server. This aligns with the **T1082-System Information Discovery** technique, which involves gathering information about the victim's system.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
