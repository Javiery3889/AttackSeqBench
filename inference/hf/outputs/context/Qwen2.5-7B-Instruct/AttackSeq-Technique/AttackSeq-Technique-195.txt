Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report details the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Resource Development**: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Use of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creation of registry Run key entries and installation as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Injection of encrypted shellcode and token privilege adjustments.
7. **Credential Access**: Use of a custom Mimikatz version.
8. **Discovery**: Collection of system information.
9. **Collection**: Reading file contents.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server after reading file contents and before exfiltrating data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process. The report mentions that SparrowDoor used encrypted shellcode and DLL search order hijacking, but it does not specify communication with the C&C server.
- **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique involves determining the physical location of the target. The report does not mention any physical location determination.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication. The report mentions that SparrowDoor exfiltrated data over the C&C channel, which implies the use of an encrypted channel.
- **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols. The report does not mention any protocol tunneling.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report explicitly states that SparrowDoor exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.
- The most plausible ATT&CK technique for encrypted communication over the C&C channel is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

### Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
