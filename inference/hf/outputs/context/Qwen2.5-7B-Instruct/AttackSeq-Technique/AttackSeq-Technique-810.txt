Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
- **Execution**: The exploit code was used to gain initial access.
- **Command and Control**: The attackers established command and control (C2) servers to communicate with the compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique used to avoid detection while establishing a backdoor connection to C2 servers after exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1498.001-Direct Network Flood**: This technique involves sending a large volume of network traffic to overwhelm the target, which is not relevant to avoiding detection while establishing a backdoor.
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client machine. While this is part of the initial access, it does not directly address avoiding detection during C2 communication.
- **T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot**: This technique involves booting the system in a safe mode to avoid detection. This is not directly related to establishing a backdoor connection to C2 servers.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the malicious activity appear as legitimate traffic to avoid detection. This is a plausible method to avoid detection while establishing a backdoor connection to C2 servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence involves exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer to gain initial access.
- After gaining access, the attackers need to establish a backdoor connection to C2 servers.
- To avoid detection, the attackers would likely use a technique that makes their malicious activity appear as legitimate traffic.
- **T1036-Masquerading** is the most plausible technique for this purpose.

### Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading
