Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan uses a main executable and a DLL for backend API calls.
   - **Persistence:** Explosive Trojan is installed with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hides from detection tools and merges into its surroundings.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Spreads manually through pivoting from initially infected servers and can use USB infection.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after conducting vulnerability scans and before using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the spread through removable media or manual pivoting.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application. It is not directly related to the spread through removable media or manual pivoting.
   - **T1480.001-Environmental Keying:** This technique involves using environmental factors to key the malware's behavior. It is not directly related to the spread through removable media or manual pivoting.
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. The CTI outline mentions that the Explosive Trojan can spread through USB infection, which is a form of replication through removable media.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of T1091-Replication Through Removable Media to spread the malware further into the target network.

Final Answer: D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
