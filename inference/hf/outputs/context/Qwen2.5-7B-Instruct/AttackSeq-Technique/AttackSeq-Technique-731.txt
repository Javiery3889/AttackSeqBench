Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the 'Red October' campaign, which includes:
- **Initial Access**: Malicious documents and Java exploitation.
- **Execution**: Setup of the main component for further communication with C&C servers and receiving additional spy modules.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that most likely supported hiding the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which of the given TTPs (techniques) could be used to hide the location of the C&C server.

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interpreters or scripting languages to execute commands. It does not directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to hiding the location of the C&C server.
- **C: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server. This can be used to hide the location of the C&C server by routing traffic through a proxy server.
- **D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves using a Winlogon helper DLL to execute code in the context of the Windows logon process. It does not directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used a layered C&C infrastructure, with one server acting as a proxy to forward requests to another server. This suggests that the attackers were using a proxy to hide the location of the 'mothership' server.
- Among the given options, **T1090-Proxy** is the technique that directly involves using a proxy to route traffic, which aligns with the description in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy
