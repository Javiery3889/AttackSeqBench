Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and sent commands, including taking screenshots, gathering system information, and executing various system commands.
   - **Persistence:** The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:** The operators used dumpers to retrieve credentials from browsers and email clients.
   - **Discovery:** The operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - **Collection:** The malware scanned for files and staged data for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were hex-encoded and encrypted before being sent to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving the network location of a resource. It is not directly related to establishing communications with a C&C server.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots. While it is a TTP used by Sednit, it is not directly related to establishing communications with a C&C server.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with a C&C server. This is the technique that would be used after the malware has established a connection with the C&C server.
   - **T1547.012-Print Processors:** This technique involves using print processors to exfiltrate data. While it is a TTP used by Sednit, it is not directly related to establishing communications with a C&C server.

Given the context of the question, the technique that would be used before establishing communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data is the one that sets up the communication channel. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve establishing the encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
