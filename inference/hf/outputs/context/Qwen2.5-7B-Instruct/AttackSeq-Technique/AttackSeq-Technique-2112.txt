Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack that includes:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with a C&C server.
7. **Exfiltration**: Sending various types of data, including screenshots, back to the attackers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives before exfiltrating the data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This technique involves shutting down or rebooting the system, which is not relevant to gathering screenshots.
- **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves network poisoning and relay attacks, which are not directly related to gathering screenshots.
- **T1555.002-Securityd Memory**: This technique involves accessing memory from a security application, which is not relevant to gathering screenshots.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen, which aligns with the question of gathering screenshots.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including screenshots, as part of their surveillance objectives.
- The question specifically asks which ATT&CK technique was used to gather screenshots.
- Among the given options, T1113-Screen Capture is the only technique that directly involves capturing the screen, which aligns with the context provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture
