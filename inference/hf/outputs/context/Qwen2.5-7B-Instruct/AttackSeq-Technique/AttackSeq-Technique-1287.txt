Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-1182 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands through Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
2. **Execution**: The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which then installed a normal sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file. UserInstall.exe used BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe, and the malicious loader used DLL hijacking to launch dllhost.exe, injecting a backdoor into it.
3. **Persistence**: The backdoor decrypted the configuration file and used SSL to connect to the C&C server.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection and created a hidden directory (UFile) to mislead defenders.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Tropic Trooper leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware. While the CTI outline mentions that the initial access was through exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents, it does not explicitly state that this was a spearphishing service.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor used SSL to connect to the C&C server, but it does not specify that this was done before the custom SSL libraries were used.
- **T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. There is no mention of steganography in the CTI outline.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to install malware. The CTI outline describes the use of an installer (UserInstall.exe) to drop the backdoor and other files, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was through exploits in Microsoft Office documents.
2. The execution phase involves the installation of the backdoor and other files using an installer.
3. The persistence phase involves the backdoor decrypting the configuration file and connecting to the C&C server using SSL.
4. The defense evasion phase involves using DLL hijacking to evade detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before leveraging custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server is the use of software deployment tools to install the backdoor and other files.

### Final Answer: D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
