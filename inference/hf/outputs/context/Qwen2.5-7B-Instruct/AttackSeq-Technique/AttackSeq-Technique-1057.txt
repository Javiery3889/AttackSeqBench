Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices, indicating advanced reconnaissance.
- **Initial Access**: The APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates and seeding malware on P2P sharing sites.
- **Execution**: The APT deploys malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and uses 0-day exploits.
- **Persistence**: The APT maintains persistence through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
- **Defense Evasion**: The APT uses digital certificates and encryption techniques.
- **Credential Access**: The APT targets stored secrets in browsers and email services.
- **Collection**: The APT collects and stores data in log files.
- **Command and Control**: The APT maintains a web interface for victim management and encrypts victim data on their servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that enables the Darkhotel APT to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources. This implies a technique that allows the APT to manage and control a wide network of compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1608.001-Upload Malware**: This technique involves uploading malware to a remote system. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly address maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.
- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server. While it helps in evading detection, it does not directly address the maintenance of a global network infrastructure.
- **C: T1584.002-DNS Server**: This technique involves compromising a DNS server to redirect traffic. While it can be used to maintain control, it is more about redirecting traffic rather than maintaining a global network infrastructure.
- **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to maintain long-term access and control. This aligns with the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the APT maintains persistence and uses a web interface for victim management, indicating a need to control a wide network of compromised systems.
- The question specifically asks about maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure, which aligns with the need to compromise and maintain control over a wide range of systems.
- Among the given options, **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** is the most relevant as it directly addresses the need to maintain long-term access and control over a global network of compromised systems.

### Final Answer: D
