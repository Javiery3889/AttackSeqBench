Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the installer 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe, which contains spyware components.
   - **Execution:** The execution flow involves sysCrt32.exe ensuring persistence and adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable. It then executes various batch files and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours.
   - **Persistence:** The spyware establishes persistence by adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% and setting up scheduled tasks.
   - **Credential Access:** libchrome.exe is used for credential access by querying Chrome's SQLite databases.
   - **Collection:** sysOptimizer.bat collects and archives personal files, and libCache32.exe and libTemp32.exe perform keylogging and clipboard content logging.
   - **Exfiltration:** sysUp32.bat collects files and uploads them to an FTP server, and it also exfiltrates Chrome passwords and crypto-wallet data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with the C2 infrastructure hosted on Novinhost after sysBus32.exe downloads and executes the second stage and other executables like libCache32.exe perform their tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to the target system, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels, which could be relevant if the primary C2 channel is detected and blocked.
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the communication with the C2 server is a critical part of the attack lifecycle. The question specifically asks about the technique that facilitated this communication. The most plausible technique for this purpose is **T1008-Fallback Channels**, as it involves using alternative communication channels, which could be necessary if the primary C2 channel is detected and blocked.

**Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
