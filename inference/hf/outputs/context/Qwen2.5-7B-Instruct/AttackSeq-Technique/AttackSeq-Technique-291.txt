Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The adversaries use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information.
- **Initial Access**: The attackers use spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and watering hole attacks with a website that downloads a malicious PowerPoint document.
- **Execution**: The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware.
- **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
- **Credential Access**: The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before pings to the C2 server were transmitted at regular intervals, after the backdoor stole Google Chrome credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and using permission groups to gain access. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the backdoor stealing credentials or pinging the C2 server.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. While it is mentioned in the watering hole attack, it does not directly lead to the pinging of the C2 server.
- **T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**: This technique involves accessing data from cloud storage services. It is not relevant to the sequence of events described.
- **T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data automatically, which aligns with the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials and then pinging the C2 server at regular intervals.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials, which is a form of automated collection (T1119).
- After stealing the credentials, the backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, which is a form of command and control (T1132).
- The sequence of TTPs that most likely occurred before pinging the C2 server is the automated collection of credentials.

### Final Answer: D: T1119-Automated Collection
