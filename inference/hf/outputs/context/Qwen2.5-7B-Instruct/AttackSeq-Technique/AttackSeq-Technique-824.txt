Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN4 uses spearphishing emails to gather credentials.
   - **Resource Development:** They organize targets using unique 'campaign codes'.
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Creating rules in Outlook to delete emails containing suspicious words.
   - **Credential Access:** Same as Initial Access, involving VBA macros and fake OWA login pages.
   - **Others:** No specific technique related to C2 communication is mentioned here.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after transmitting stolen credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique is about gathering information about the victim, which is not relevant to C2 communication.
   - **T1590.002-DNS:** DNS is a protocol for translating domain names into IP addresses. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not specifically about anonymity.
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary, which can help in maintaining anonymity and evading detection.
   - **T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves establishing a connection by using a specific sequence of packets to open a port. It is not directly related to maintaining anonymity in C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any specific technique for C2 communication, but it does emphasize the need to evade detection.
   - The use of proxies (T1090) can help in maintaining anonymity and evading detection, which aligns with the described evasion techniques (e.g., deleting suspicious emails).

**Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy**
