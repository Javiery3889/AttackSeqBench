Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails containing a dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat).
- **Persistence**: Deployment of a remote shell and Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit).
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploitation of a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) using an open-source tool and leveraging Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) to obtain credentials.
- **Defense Evasion**: Utilizing search order hijacking and custom malware to remain undetected.
- **Credential Access**: Using Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
- **Discovery**: Mapping the network and infecting further computers.
- **Lateral Movement**: Compromising additional machines using stolen credentials.
- **Collection**: Stealing sensitive information.
- **Command and Control**: Configuring multiple C&C domains and using encrypted payloads.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating large volumes of information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the initial access via spear-phishing emails containing a dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat) and the execution of malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a web application to execute malicious code. It does not align with the scenario of a dropper being executed via a spear-phishing email.
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and classifying resources in the network. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to gaining elevated privileges.
- **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. It could be relevant if the dropper used a shared module to gain elevated privileges, but the outline does not specifically mention this.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to gain access or maintain access to a system. The execution of a dropper and the subsequent privilege escalation using a known vulnerability and Mimikatz aligns closely with this technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The dropper (Trojan.Vcrodat) is executed, which is a form of software deployment.
- The execution of the dropper likely involves deploying a malicious DLL to gain elevated privileges.
- The use of a known vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) and Mimikatz to obtain credentials and escalate privileges is a form of software deployment to maintain access and control.

Given the context and the specific TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1072-Software Deployment Tools.

### Final Answer: D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
