Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The malware gathered system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** Malware named TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Process hollowing and obfuscation of the payload.
   - **Command and Control:** Encrypted and encoded commands communicated with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after TDrop2 evaded detection through process hollowing and disguised payload retrieval for defense evasion.
   - The context is that the malware gathered details about the infected system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native system APIs to perform actions. While it could be relevant, it is not specifically about gathering system details.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the CTI outline stating that the malware gathered system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique is about evading detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments, which is not directly related to gathering system details.
   - **T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves archiving files using a library, which is not relevant to the context of gathering system details.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the malware gathered system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that aligns with this activity.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly corresponds to the gathering of system details.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
