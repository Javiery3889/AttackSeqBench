Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Phishing email with a link to a SharePoint URL that downloads a ZIP file containing a VBS script, which drops a JavaScript backdoor.
2. **Execution**: Deployment of a JavaScript backdoor that connects to a domain and installs the CARBANAK RAT on domain controllers.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Use of RunPsExec to install a second malicious code, a PowerShell RAT.
4. **Collection**: Exfiltration of data using SmartFTP Client.
5. **Command and Control**: CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT communicate with C2 servers.
6. **Exfiltration**: Data theft using SmartFTP Client.
7. **Impact**: Deployment of RYUK ransomware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery before the data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Cobalt Strike**: This is a tool used for penetration testing and cyber-attacks, often used for reconnaissance and data discovery.
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
- **T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the state of a system, which is more about verifying the state rather than discovering new information.
- **T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an SSH session, which is not directly related to reconnaissance and data discovery.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is more about executing commands rather than discovering new information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that Cobalt Strike was used for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
- T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most relevant ATT&CK technique for this purpose, as it directly aligns with the act of gathering information about remote systems, which is a key part of reconnaissance and data discovery.

### Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery
