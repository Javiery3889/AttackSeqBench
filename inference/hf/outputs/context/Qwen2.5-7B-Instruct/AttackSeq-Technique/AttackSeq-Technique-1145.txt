Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** GroundPeony used spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs to deliver malicious payloads.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations to evade detection.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs and before the DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

3. **Matching the Sequence:**
   - The spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs fall under the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - The DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations fall under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - We need to find a technique that bridges these two phases.

4. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil** - This technique involves using the InstallUtil utility to install and configure malicious software. It does not directly relate to the spear-phishing or defense evasion phases.
   - **B: T1053.002-At** - This technique involves using the "at" command to schedule tasks. It is not directly related to the spear-phishing or defense evasion phases.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using web services to exfiltrate data or deliver payloads. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly fit the sequence between initial access and defense evasion.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared modules to evade detection. It aligns well with the transition from initial access (spear-phishing) to defense evasion (DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations).

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs deliver the payload, which then uses shared modules (T1129) to evade detection through DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
