Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware was delivered via a malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae, likely as part of a phishing campaign.
   - **C2 Communication:** The malware made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence:**
   - The initial access technique used was phishing (T1566).
   - The malware then communicated with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to establish communication with the initial C2 domain judystevenson[.]info before additional C2 domains were identified.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1001.001-Junk Data** - This technique involves sending junk data to test network defenses, which is not relevant to establishing initial C2 communication.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks** - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify open ports and services, which is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a connection, which is relevant to the POST request made to the C2 domain.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is the initial access technique used, but it does not directly establish the C2 communication.

5. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The initial access technique (phishing) is already established and does not directly relate to the C2 communication.
   - The POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info is the next step in the sequence, which aligns with the use of an application layer protocol (T1071).

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
