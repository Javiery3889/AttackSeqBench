Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN4 uses spearphishing emails to gather information about their targets.
   - **Resource Development:** They organize targets using campaign codes and transmit stolen credentials to C2 servers.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access to the targets' information.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They create rules in victims' Outlook accounts to delete emails containing certain keywords.
   - **Command and Control:** They use C2 servers to collect stolen credentials and rely on Tor for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1528-Steal Application Access Token:** This technique involves stealing access tokens from applications, which is not directly related to the use of VBA macros in spearphishing emails.
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which could be relevant if the VBA macros were designed to capture user inputs, but the context suggests the macros are used to prompt for Outlook credentials.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves creating email forwarding rules, which is mentioned in the context of defense evasion, not initial access.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is also mentioned in the context of defense evasion, not initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros are used to prompt users for their Outlook credentials.
   - The VBA macros are designed to extract these credentials from the user.
   - This process of extracting credentials through a malicious macro is best described by the technique of capturing user input, which is closely related to the technique of stealing credentials.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
