Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
2. **Execution**: The attack involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities and executing them in memory.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The attack pattern included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication.
4. **Lateral Movement**: APT-TOCS depended on network projection and could laterally move within the internal network.
5. **Communication**: The attack communicated via Beacon mode, sending network heartbeat packages every 60 seconds, and transmitting data information via the Cookie field.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after APT-TOCS relied on lateral movement within the internal network to conduct attacks and before communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement (T1573.003)**: This technique involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. The CTI outline mentions that APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network.
- **HTTP GET Requests (T1190)**: This technique involves using HTTP GET requests to communicate with compromised systems. The CTI outline mentions that the attack communicated via Beacon mode, which could include HTTP GET requests.

Given the sequence, the technique that would logically occur after lateral movement and before HTTP GET requests would be a technique that facilitates or enables the communication. 

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1562.004 - Disable or Modify System Firewall**: This technique is about disabling or modifying firewalls, which is not directly related to the communication phase.
- **B: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to the internal network communication.
- **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. This is a plausible candidate as it could be used to facilitate the HTTP GET requests.
- **D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for command and control. While this could be used for communication, it is more about the method of communication rather than the protocol used.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, is that after lateral movement, the technique that would enable the communication via HTTP GET requests is T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
