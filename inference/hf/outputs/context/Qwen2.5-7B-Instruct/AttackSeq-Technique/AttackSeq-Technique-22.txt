Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used when "Machete" took photos from the computer's web camera after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The persistence technique mentioned in the CTI outline is the creation of a scheduled task named 'Microsoft_up' and placing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - The question is about a technique that involves taking photos from the web camera, which is related to the T1125-Video Capture technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any technique related to taking photos from the web camera.
   - However, the question is asking about a specific action (taking photos from the web camera) that would be part of the malware's behavior after persistence has been established.
   - The persistence technique (T1053-Scheduled Task/Job) is used to ensure the malware remains active, but it does not directly address the action of taking photos from the web camera.
   - The T1125-Video Capture technique is the most relevant to the action of taking photos from the web camera.

**Final Answer: D: T1125-Video Capture**
