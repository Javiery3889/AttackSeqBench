Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: The adversaries used various functions to execute their code, including `LoadLibraryA`, `CreateProcessA`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`, `LdrRegisterDllNotification`, and `LdrUnregisterDllNotification`. They also used `cmd.exe` and PowerShell for execution.
- **Persistence**: The adversaries manipulated the registry using functions like `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, and `DeleteKey` to ensure persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: The adversaries used memory manipulation functions such as `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, and `ZwClose`. They also used `RtlNtStatusToDosError` to obscure their activities.
- **Discovery**: The adversaries gathered system information using `GetStringValue`, `GetDWORDValue`, and `CreateKey` functions to query the registry. They also used `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` for thread context manipulation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols after the adversaries have used discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to establishing HTTP/HTTPS communication.
- **T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique is about disrupting network services, which is not relevant to establishing communication.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) to exfiltrate data or establish command and control (C2) communication.
- **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs, which is more related to execution and persistence rather than communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The adversaries have already used discovery techniques to gather system information and manipulate thread contexts. The next logical step would be to establish communication, which is best described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols, which is a common method for exfiltrating data or establishing C2 channels.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
