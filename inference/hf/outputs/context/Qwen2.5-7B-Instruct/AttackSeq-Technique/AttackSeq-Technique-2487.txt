Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment.
2. **Execution**: Exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability and use of PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager).
3. **Persistence**: Execution of malicious content via hijacked COM objects and creation of a local account.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Use of reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager).
5. **Command and Control**: Creation of multiple stages for obfuscation and use of legitimate external services for bidirectional communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the adversaries acquired and prepared infrastructure such as domains and malware to support their operations. This implies a preparatory phase before the initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**: This technique involves making or impersonating a token to gain elevated privileges. It does not fit the context of acquiring and preparing infrastructure.
- **T1608.002-Upload Tool**: This technique involves uploading tools to a remote system. While it is related to infrastructure, it is more about the actual deployment rather than the preparation phase.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves configuring files or registry entries to run during system boot or logon. It is more about persistence rather than the initial preparation.
- **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing or acquiring the tools and infrastructure needed to support the attack. It fits the context of acquiring and preparing infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the technique that occurred when the adversaries acquired and prepared infrastructure.
- T1587-Develop Capabilities is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the development and acquisition of tools and infrastructure necessary for the attack.
- The other techniques (T1134.003, T1608.002, and T1547) are more specific to different phases of the attack lifecycle and do not fit the preparatory phase as well as T1587.

### Final Answer: D: T1587-Develop Capabilities
