Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The EyePyramid malware communicated with C2 servers (e.g., eyepyramid[.]com, hostpenta[.]com).
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrated stolen data using email addresses (e.g., gpool@hostpenta[.]com, hanger@hostpenta[.]com).
   - **Targeting:** The attackers targeted high-profile individuals, including politicians, bankers, freemasons, law enforcement personalities, and even Vatican Cardinals.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the EyePyramid attackers communicated with their C2 servers to exfiltrate stolen data.
   - The specific TTP in question is the delivery of malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails to target high-profile individuals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. Given that the attackers targeted high-profile individuals via spear-phishing emails, this is a strong candidate.
   - **T1583.006-Web Services:** This technique involves using web services for data exfiltration, which does not align with the described method of exfiltration via email.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over protocols other than the primary network protocol, which is not relevant to the described method of exfiltration via email.
   - **T1199-Trusted Relationship:** This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship to gain access to a system, which does not fit the described scenario of delivering malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the attack and the specific mention of high-profile individuals being targeted via spear-phishing emails, is T1566-Phishing.

Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing
