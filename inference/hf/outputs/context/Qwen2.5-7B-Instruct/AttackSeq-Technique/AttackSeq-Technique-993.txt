Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with a phishing email and a VBS script that dropped a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Execution of Malware:** The VBS script executed an obfuscated script and loaded a DLL file in memory. This is a critical point for our analysis.

2. **Identify the Relevant TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline that are relevant to the execution of the malware include:
     - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. However, the question is about the execution of the malware, not data exfiltration.
     - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules:** This technique is about hiding malicious content in emails, which is not relevant to the execution of the malware.
     - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. Loading a DLL file in memory is a form of using shared modules.
     - **T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM):** This technique involves using the Component Object Model to execute code. While this could be relevant, the specific mention of loading a DLL in memory is more directly related to shared modules.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1129-Shared Modules (C):** This technique directly aligns with the action of loading a DLL file in memory, which is a common method to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **T1559.001-Component Object Model (D):** While this technique is related to executing code, it is more specific to the COM architecture and not as directly related to the loading of a DLL in memory.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is T1129-Shared Modules.

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
