Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key steps:
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the Komplex Trojan, which drops the XAgent malware.
2. **Execution**: The XAgent malware initializes its components, including the BootXLoader and MainHandler.
3. **Persistence**: The Komplex Dropper and XAgent's Launcher ensure the malware remains on the system.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The XAgent checks for debuggers and uses a decoy PDF.
5. **Credential Access**: The Password module obtains passwords from Firefox profiles.
6. **Discovery**: The InfoOS module gathers information such as IOPlatformUUID, process lists, and OS versions.
7. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with C&C servers.
8. **Exfiltration**: The msgPacket structure is used to exfiltrate data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the InfoOS module gathered information and before the msgPacket structure was used for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system. The InfoOS module is described as gathering information such as IOPlatformUUID, process lists, and OS versions, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which is not the focus of the InfoOS module's activities.
- **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the data gathering process described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The InfoOS module gathers information from the local system, which is a form of data collection.
- The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of this data using the msgPacket structure.
- The most plausible technique that fits between these two steps is T1005-Data from Local System, as it directly describes the process of gathering and potentially preparing data for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: T1005-Data from Local System
