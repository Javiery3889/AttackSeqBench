Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malspam campaign used a lure PDF with an embedded RTF file that exploited CVE-2017-8579 via an HTA file.
   - **Persistence:** ComboJack copies itself to a system location, sets hidden and system attributes, and ensures persistence by setting a registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** ComboJack uses attrib.exe to hide itself and execute with SYSTEM level privileges.
   - **Collection:** ComboJack checks the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet information and replaces it with a hardcoded wallet address.
   - **Impact:** The malware redirects funds to the attacker by altering clipboard contents.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malspam campaign (exploiting CVE-2017-8579) and before ComboJack ensured persistence by setting a registry key.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the execution of commands or persistence.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. The HTA file containing encoded PowerShell commands aligns with this technique.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding files or processes to evade detection. While ComboJack does hide itself using attrib.exe, this technique is more about hiding artifacts after the initial execution.
   - **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted channel that is not a command and control (C2) protocol. It does not fit the sequence as it is about data exfiltration, not execution or persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline involves the execution of commands via an HTA file, which aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - After the execution of commands, the malware ensures persistence by setting a registry key, which is a separate step.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
