Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Fake Flash installer drops a loader and the main backdoor.
   - **Execution:** Fake Flash installer executes a Metasploit shellcode, which downloads a Meterpreter.
   - **Persistence:** Custom executable `msupdateconf.exe` is saved to the Startup folder to maintain a Meterpreter session.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` is used for privilege escalation.
   - **Persistence (continued):** Another custom executable executes PowerShell scripts.

2. **Identify the Persistence Technique:**
   - The persistence technique involves saving `msupdateconf.exe` to the Startup folder, which grants the attacker a persistent Meterpreter session.

3. **Identify the C2 Communication:**
   - The question asks about the technique used when the decoded shellcode contacted its C&C at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` to direct the download of additional shellcode.

4. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking about the technique used for C2 communication, specifically the communication protocol or method used to contact the C&C server.

5. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding the payload to evade detection, which is not directly related to the communication protocol.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which fits the scenario of contacting a C&C server via HTTPS.
   - **C: T1588.001-Malware** - This is a general term for malware and does not specify a communication technique.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using command-line interpreters or scripting interpreters, which is not directly related to the communication protocol.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of an application layer protocol for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
