Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: A phishing email was sent to Tibetan organizations, leading to the installation of the FriarFox malicious Firefox browser extension.
- **Defense Evasion**: The FriarFox browser extension contacts a command and control (C2) server to retrieve the PHP and JS-based payload, Scanbox.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the FriarFox browser extension contacted a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. While this could be a plausible technique, the question specifically asks about the action of contacting a server to retrieve the payload.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material to gain access to systems. This does not fit the context of contacting a server to retrieve a payload.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This could be relevant, but it is more about the protocol used rather than the action of contacting a server.
- **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a remote service session to gain unauthorized access to a system. This does not fit the context of contacting a server to retrieve a payload.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The FriarFox browser extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload is a clear indication of the threat actors establishing a communication channel with their C2 server. This action is best described by the ATT&CK technique that involves establishing a connection to a remote server to retrieve or send data.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**

This choice best fits the context of the FriarFox browser extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, as it involves the use of application layer protocols to maintain communication with the C2 server.
