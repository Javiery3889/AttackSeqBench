Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions the collection of malicious HWP file samples, which were used in targeted attacks.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that would simplify malicious EPS file code to evade detection after the initial access via HWP files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email addresses for later use in an attack. It does not directly relate to simplifying code or evading detection.
   - **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves modifying file paths to avoid detection by security software. It could be relevant if the goal is to evade detection, but it does not directly simplify code.
   - **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves modifying registry permissions to run malicious code. It is not directly related to simplifying code or evading detection.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. It could be relevant if the goal is to simplify the code and make it harder to detect, as removing indicators can make the code appear more benign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack starts with exploiting a vulnerability in HWP files.
   - The question asks about a technique to simplify malicious EPS file code for better evasion.
   - Among the given options, T1070-Indicator Removal is the most relevant because it directly addresses the goal of making the code harder to detect, which aligns with the need to simplify the code for better evasion.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
