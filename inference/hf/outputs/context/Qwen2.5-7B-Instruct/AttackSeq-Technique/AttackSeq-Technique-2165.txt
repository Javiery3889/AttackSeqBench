Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
   - **Persistence:** The device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT35 evaded detection by conducting minimal activity and avoiding security alerts.
   - **Discovery:** Darktrace's Cyber AI identified the C2 traffic.
   - **Lateral Movement:** No lateral movement or data exfiltration was detected after C2 beaconing was identified.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when Darktrace detected C2 activity with domains like cortanaservice[.]com, after APT35 had evaded detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves changing the resolution of a domain name to a legitimate or malicious IP address. This does not directly relate to the detection of C2 activity.
   - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This could be relevant as the detection of C2 activity might involve DNS queries.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading, disrupting, or removing defensive measures. This does not directly relate to the detection of C2 activity.
   - **T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to gain unauthorized access. This does not directly relate to the detection of C2 activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the detection of C2 activity with domains like cortanaservice[.]com is the context. This implies that the technique should be related to DNS resolution or the use of DNS for C2 communication.
   - Among the given options, T1071.004-DNS is the most relevant as it directly involves the use of DNS for domain resolution, which is a common method for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071.004-DNS**
