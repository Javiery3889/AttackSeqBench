Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The phishing page invited users to download a video app, which was actually an archive file containing ActionSpy.
   - **Execution:** ActionSpy impersonates a legitimate app, collects device information, and uses Accessibility services to monitor and steal chat logs.
   - **Persistence:** ActionSpy remains active by prompting users to enable its Accessibility service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** ActionSpy uses various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** ActionSpy collects chat logs from messaging apps.
   - **Collection:** ActionSpy gathers a wide range of data, including device location, contacts, call logs, SMS messages, and more.
   - **Command and Control:** ActionSpy communicates with a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malicious scripts on a phishing page were used to target individuals in Tibet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline describes the initial access via a phishing page and the subsequent execution of ActionSpy, which then collects various types of data.
   - The question is asking for the next step after the initial access, which is the collection of data.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is part of the initial reconnaissance phase, not the data collection phase.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique involves the automated collection of data, which aligns with the description of ActionSpy collecting various types of data.
   - **C: T1546.005-Trap** - This technique involves setting up a trap to capture or observe the target, which is not directly related to the data collection phase.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases** - This technique involves searching for information in open technical databases, which is not relevant to the data collection phase described in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B: T1119-Automated Collection**
