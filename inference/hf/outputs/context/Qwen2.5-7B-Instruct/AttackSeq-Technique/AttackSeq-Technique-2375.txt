Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives.
   - **Execution:** The malware operates as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware includes features to clean up after itself and employs date sensitivity.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated via a custom XOR operation.
   - **Command and Control:** Commands are stored in an encrypted file on the local 'master' system.
   - **Exfiltration:** The means of exfiltration are not determined, but the data collection functionality suggests the need for either remote or local intruder access to the 'master' system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware collected detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of an attack. The malware's self-deletion on a hardcoded date is a form of defense evasion, not collection of system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the operating system, hardware, and network configuration. The malware's collection of system properties like IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions aligns with this technique.
   - **T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook. The question does not mention exfiltration, so this is not relevant.
   - **T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information from web browsers. The malware's collection of system properties is not specific to web browsers, so this is not relevant.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The malware's collection of detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.

Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
