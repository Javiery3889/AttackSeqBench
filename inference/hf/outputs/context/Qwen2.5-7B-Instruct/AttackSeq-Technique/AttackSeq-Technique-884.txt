Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear phishing with exploits for known vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to actively scan the local area network, find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067, or accessible with admin credentials from their password database.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique employed to infect remote hosts during lateral movement in the local area network, after the initial access but before the establishment of a sophisticated C&C infrastructure.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data:** This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not directly related to the lateral movement described in the CTI outline.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services, which aligns with the CTI outline's mention of scanning for hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 or accessible with admin credentials.
   - **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket:** This technique involves passing a ticket to gain access to network resources, which is more related to Kerberos ticket manipulation and not directly to the scanning and exploitation of hosts.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which is also not directly related to the scanning and exploitation of hosts during lateral movement.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for infecting remote hosts during lateral movement in the local area network is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
