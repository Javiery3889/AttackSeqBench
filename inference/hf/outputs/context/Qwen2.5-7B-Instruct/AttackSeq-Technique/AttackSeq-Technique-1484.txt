Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: Babar uses a dropper to fetch and decrypt a DLL, which is then loaded using `regsvr32.exe`.
- **Persistence**: Babar ensures persistence by creating a registry key that executes `regsvr32.exe` at boot time.
- **Collection**: The implant logs keystrokes, captures screenshots, and spies on applications.
- **Command and Control**: Babar communicates with C&C servers through a remote thread injection.
- **Exfiltration**: Babar compresses and encrypts data before dumping it to disk.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a TTP that occurs after the implant reduces forensic artifacts by deleting the dropper binary and before it actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves using IPC mechanisms to communicate between processes. It does not fit the context of deleting the dropper binary.
- **T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using SSH for remote access. It is not related to deleting the dropper binary.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not fit the context of deleting the dropper binary.
- **T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**: This technique involves modifying cloud compute configurations. It is not related to deleting the dropper binary.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The TTP that most likely occurred after Babar's implant reduces forensic artifacts by executing a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from the disk and before it actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module is not explicitly listed in the provided answer choices. However, the closest match in the context of the question is a technique that involves deleting files to reduce forensic artifacts.

Given the options provided, none of them directly match the described TTP. However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the context of deleting files, the most plausible answer would be:

Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

This is the closest match because it involves obfuscating or deleting files, which aligns with the described TTP of deleting the dropper binary to reduce forensic artifacts.
