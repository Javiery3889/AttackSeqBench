To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
2. **Execution**: Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript) and rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, and CreateProcess to launch additional components.
3. **Persistence**: Registration of modules as scheduled tasks, use of Registry Run keys, and Startup folder.
4. **Discovery**: Automatic listing of interesting files for future exfiltration.
5. **Lateral Movement**: Injection of malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
6. **Collection**: Searching for sensitive documents and taking screenshots.
7. **Command and Control**: Use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
8. **Exfiltration**: Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Gamaredon employed obfuscated files and information to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office and before their backdoors automatically listed interesting files for exfiltration purposes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to achieve persistence or other objectives. It is a common persistence technique but does not directly relate to deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
- **T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting file permissions to execute malicious files. It is not directly related to deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
- **T1055.015-ListPlanting**: This technique involves planting files in a location where they will be executed, such as the Startup folder or scheduled tasks. This could be a plausible technique to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office by planting malicious macros or scripts.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Obfuscation and Deactivation**: The question mentions obfuscation and deactivation of security mechanisms in Microsoft Office. This suggests a technique that directly interacts with Office files to disable security features.
2. **ListPlanting (T1055.015)**: This technique involves planting files in a location where they will be executed. In the context of Microsoft Office, this could involve planting malicious macros or scripts that deactivate security features.
3. **Automatic Listing of Interesting Files (T1055.015)**: This technique involves automatically listing interesting files for exfiltration, which is a later step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, is that **T1055.015-ListPlanting** occurred after Gamaredon employed obfuscation and deactivation of security mechanisms in Microsoft Office and before their backdoors automatically listed interesting files for exfiltration purposes.

**Final Answer: C: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
