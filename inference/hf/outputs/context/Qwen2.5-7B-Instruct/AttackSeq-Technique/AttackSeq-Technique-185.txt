Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
- **Execution**: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
- **Persistence**: The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The malware inherits root privileges.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware decompresses executables and checks if it is executed by init.
- **Credential Access**: The malware scrapes credentials and key information.
- **Collection**: The malware collects files based on predefined extensions and from application and data directories.
- **Command and Control**: The malware uses a Tor hidden service and SSH for C2.
- **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that enables Infamous Chisel to enumerate data directories and gather system information after collecting predefined files and before exfiltrating them.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique is related to stealing web cookies, which is not relevant to the context of directory discovery and system information gathering.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS for data exfiltration, which is not relevant to the initial directory discovery.
- **T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique is about stealing cloud account credentials, which is not relevant to the context of directory discovery.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and listing files and directories on the target system, which aligns with the context of gathering system information and directories.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that Infamous Chisel collects files from application and data directories containing communication data. This indicates that the malware is performing file and directory discovery.
- The question asks about the technique that enables the malware to enumerate data directories and gather system information after collecting predefined files and before exfiltrating them.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the process of identifying and listing files and directories, which is a crucial step before exfiltration.

### Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
