### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** CosmicStrand modifies the firmware to redirect execution to attacker-supplied code.
   - **Communication:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention communication with a C2 server using crafted UDP or TCP packets. However, it does indicate that CosmicStrand has been used to control victim machines and that C2 servers have been identified.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after CosmicStrand achieved defense evasion by modifying the firmware.
   - The specific technique in question is communication with a C2 server using crafted UDP or TCP packets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1014-Rootkit:** This technique is about using a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection. It does not specifically address communication with a C2 server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain persistence. While it could be relevant, it is not specifically about crafted UDP or TCP packets.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. It does not address the communication aspect.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using non-application layer protocols (like UDP or TCP) to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. This aligns with the question's specific mention of crafted UDP or TCP packets.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: D**
