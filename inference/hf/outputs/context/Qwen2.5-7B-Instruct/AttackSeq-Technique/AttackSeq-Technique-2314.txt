Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Credentials obtained through credential stuffing or password spraying.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike installed in memory using PowerShell.
   - **Persistence:** No persistence mechanisms on the compromised system, but the adversary installs Cobalt Strike on systems with high uptimes.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Password spraying against domain admin accounts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-forensics activities like cleaning Windows event logs, file deletion, and timestomping.
   - **Credential Access:** Brute force and credential stuffing.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like PsLogList used to discover accounts and identify privileged users.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using Cobalt Strike's built-in methods to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** Using Cobalt Strike for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** Using a custom-built tool to exfiltrate data to cloud storage web services.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the adversary copied results from the discovery phase, including file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes, before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1114-Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email content, which is part of the discovery phase but not specifically about copying file and directory lists or remote system shares.
   - **T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware, which is not relevant to the context of copying and exfiltrating data.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive, which aligns with the context of copying file and directory lists and remote system shares.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services, which is more about the initial access phase rather than the copying and exfiltration phase.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that fits the scenario of copying file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes before exfiltration is **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**.

**Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
