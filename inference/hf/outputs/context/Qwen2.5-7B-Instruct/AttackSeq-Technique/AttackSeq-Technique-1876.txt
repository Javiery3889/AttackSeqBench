To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the CTI outline and the question step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
- **Execution**: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
- **Persistence**: Various methods are used, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizes common techniques, including ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil.
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities for stealth.
- **Credential Access**: Uses LSASS process memory dumping and network sniffing.
- **Discovery**: Leverages native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for reconnaissance.
- **Lateral Movement**: Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells for movement.
- **Collection**: Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Command and Control**: Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1596.004-CDNs**: This technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content. It is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers or web shells.
- **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into image files to execute when the image is opened. It is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers or web shells.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It is a plausible candidate as it could be the initial step in establishing initial access.
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the target network. While it is a common step in the attack lifecycle, it is more likely to occur after initial access has been established.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
- **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment, which aligns with the exploitation of external servers and the use of web shells as a consistent gateway.
- **Gathering Victim Network Information (T1590)**: While this is a common step, it is more likely to occur after initial access has been established.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
