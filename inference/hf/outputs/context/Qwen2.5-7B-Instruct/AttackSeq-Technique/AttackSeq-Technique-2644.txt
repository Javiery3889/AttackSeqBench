Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing using legitimate-looking documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of a downloader to install the backdoor components.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Various techniques to avoid detection.
5. **Credential Access**: Targeting credentials.
6. **Discovery**: Conducting network and system discovery.
7. **Collection**: Stealing data, logging keystrokes, and capturing screenshots.
8. **Command and Control**: Using FTP and HTTP for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP that ensures the scheduled transfer of collected data to the remote server every 10 minutes after using FTP and HTTP channels for Command and Control communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data. Given that the malware already has persistence and is collecting data, it makes sense that it would automate the exfiltration process.
- **T1484.002-Trust Modification**: This technique involves modifying trust relationships to gain unauthorized access. It does not fit the context of scheduled data transfer.
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network configurations. It is not related to the scheduled transfer of data.
- **T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage. While it is related to data exfiltration, the question specifies a scheduled transfer every 10 minutes, which is more aligned with T1020.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware uses Windows Task Scheduler tasks for persistence, which aligns with the idea of scheduling actions.
- The question asks about a scheduled transfer of collected data every 10 minutes, which is a form of automated exfiltration.
- T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the automated and scheduled exfiltration of data.

### Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
