Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign involved phishing emails with embedded macros.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved through a phishing email containing a malicious Word document.
   - **Execution:** The document executed a VBS macro that ran a PowerShell script to download and execute payloads.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The PowerShell script operated in memory and used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
   - **Impact:** The payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred before the PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers and utilized methods such as `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about downloading payloads.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the downloading of payloads.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. The PowerShell script downloading payloads fits this description, as it is transferring tools (malware) to the target system.
   - **T1027.003-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other data. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about downloading payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking about a technique that occurs before the PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers and downloads payloads.
   - The PowerShell script is described as operating in memory and using the .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
   - The technique that best fits this description is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, as it involves the transfer of tools (malware) to the target system, which is exactly what the PowerShell script is doing.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
