Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with password-protected RAR archive attachments containing malicious Excel Web Query files.
   - **Execution:** PowerShell script named RogueRobin, obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique from Invoke-Obfuscation, and sandbox detection using WMI queries and process enumeration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the execution of the PowerShell script, which was obfuscated and included sandbox detection methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1555.002-Securityd Memory:** This technique involves modifying the memory of a process to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the execution sequence described.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves compromising or subverting security controls, which is not directly related to the execution sequence described.
   - **T1564.011-Ignore Process Interrupts:** This technique involves ignoring process interrupts to maintain persistence. It is more related to maintaining persistence rather than the execution phase.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. The question mentions that the PowerShell script was obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique, which is a form of data encoding.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerShell script, after execution, would involve encoding the data to evade detection. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
