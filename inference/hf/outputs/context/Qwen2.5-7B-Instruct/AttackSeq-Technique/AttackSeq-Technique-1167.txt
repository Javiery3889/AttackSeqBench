Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn used a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Longhorn exfiltrates data at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after Longhorn utilized secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection are related to the removal of indicators that could be used to detect the malware. This aligns with the concept of "Indicator Removal" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts, which does not align with the context of secure erase protocols.
   - **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not related to secure erase protocols.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is not related to secure erase protocols.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators to avoid detection, which aligns with the secure erase protocols mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
