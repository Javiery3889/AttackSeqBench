Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, likely using publicly available exploits.
- **Execution**: Deployed custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
- **Persistence**: Achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
- **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, some obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function.
- **Command and Control**: Communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
- **Impact**: Deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that enabled Agrius to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network after using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat messages to exfiltrate data or deliver malicious content. It does not align with the context of exploiting systems remotely.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the initial exploitation of systems.
- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. It aligns with the initial access and exploitation phase.
- **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using SMB or Windows admin shares to move laterally within a network. It is more about lateral movement rather than the initial exploitation.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that Agrius exploited public-facing applications and used webshells for lateral movement. The initial exploitation phase is crucial here, and the technique that best fits this context is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, as it directly relates to the initial access and exploitation of systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
