Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware was downloaded via a compromised website.
- **Execution**: The malware, named `gpsvc.exe`, is a packed executable that drops a known Lazarus group malware variant.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses a commercial packer and executes system information gathering commands, sending results to the C&C server `eye-watch[.]in`.
- **Discovery**: The malware gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that establishes communication between the malware and the C&C server using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1136.003-Cloud Account**: This technique involves using a cloud account to exfiltrate data. It does not match the context of establishing communication with a C&C server.
- **T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves establishing a connection by sending packets to specific ports in a specific order. It does not match the context of mimicking a browser.
- **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves using vulnerabilities to evade detection. It does not match the context of establishing communication with a C&C server.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a covert channel. Mimicking a Firefox browser to establish communication fits this description.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server `eye-watch[.]in`.
- The question asks about a technique that establishes communication using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the only technique that fits the context of using an application layer protocol (mimicking a browser) to establish communication.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
