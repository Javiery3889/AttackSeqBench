To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with compromised systems during the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that the attackers used a supply chain compromise as their initial access vector, specifically a compromised software update. This is listed as T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, with the sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used various execution techniques, including T1072 Software Deployment Tools, to run malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used several defense evasion techniques, including T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution as a Command and Control (C2) technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure:** This technique is about hiding infrastructure used for C2, which is not the initial communication method but a method to avoid detection.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2, which could be a method for communication but is not the initial access method.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique is about the initial access method used by the attackers, which is the compromise of a software update. This is the most likely method for initial communication before any other C2 techniques are used.
   - **D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves using invalid code signatures to evade detection, which is a defense evasion technique and not a communication method.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The initial access method used by the attackers was a supply chain compromise, which is listed as T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.
- This initial access method would have facilitated the initial communication with the compromised systems.
- After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely use other techniques for C2, such as T1071-Application Layer Protocol, but the initial communication would have been facilitated by the initial access method.

**Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
