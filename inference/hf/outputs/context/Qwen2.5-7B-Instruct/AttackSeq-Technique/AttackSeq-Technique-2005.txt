Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T1190 (using a .NET/MSIL dropper)
   - **Execution:** T1203 (deploying a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper)
   - **Persistence:** T1543 (creating a scheduled task for persistence)
   - **Defense Evasion:** T1027 (fingerprinting the system and setting up persistence without raising suspicion)
   - **Discovery:** T1018 (fingerprinting the system by executing commands and saving the output)
   - **Exfiltration:** T1041 (exfiltrating files and downloading files)

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique when the KopiLuwak backdoor began communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is focused on the communication phase, specifically the interaction with compromised legitimate websites.
   - The relevant ATT&CK technique for this scenario is T1102-Web Service, which involves using web services to exfiltrate data or receive commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **A: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - This technique is about discovering network shares, which is not relevant to the communication with websites.
   - **B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling** - This technique involves using protocols to tunnel data, which is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique fits the scenario of using web services to communicate with compromised websites.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique is about creating scheduled tasks, which is not the focus of the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
