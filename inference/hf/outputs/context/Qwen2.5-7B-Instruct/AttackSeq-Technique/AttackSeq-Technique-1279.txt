Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key steps:
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain access.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoor loads an encrypted configuration file and connects to C&C servers using SSL.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
4. **Command and Control**: TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server and decrypts its configuration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP that occurred after the initial access and installation of the MSI package. The question mentions that the backdoor installer abused BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK technique best fits the scenario described in the question.

- **T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using malicious links to deliver malware. It does not fit the scenario of using BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it could be relevant, it does not specifically describe the use of BITSadmin.
- **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. This fits the scenario where the backdoor installer uses DLL hijacking to load `wab32res.dll` through `sidebar.exe`.
- **T1558.001-Golden Ticket**: This technique involves creating a Golden Ticket to gain unauthorized access to network resources. It does not fit the scenario described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor installer uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
- The question specifically asks about the use of BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.
- Among the given choices, **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** is the most relevant technique as it describes modifying the execution flow of a process, which aligns with the DLL hijacking described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow
