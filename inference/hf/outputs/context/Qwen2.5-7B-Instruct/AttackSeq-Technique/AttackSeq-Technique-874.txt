Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The actors use DLL side-loading to execute a malicious DLL.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use DLL side-loading and embed Tetris within the malware.
   - **Command and Control:** New C2 infrastructure (etybh[.]com) is associated with the Musical Chairs campaign.
   - **Others:** No direct information about initial access through email, but it mentions the correction of a previous blog post.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated initial access through email delivery before employing DLL side-loading for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores:** This technique is about managing secrets in cloud services, which is not related to email delivery.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique is about altering the execution flow of a process, which is related to the execution phase but not the initial access.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking a user into providing sensitive information or downloading malware, which is a common method for initial access through email.
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique is a specific type of phishing that targets a specific individual or organization, which is also a method for initial access through email.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible initial access technique through email delivery would be either T1566-Phishing or T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service. However, since T1566.003 is a more specific type of phishing, it is more likely to be the technique used in this scenario.

**Final Answer: D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
