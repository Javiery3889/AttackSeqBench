### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT42 uses spear phishing and social engineering to gather intelligence.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops custom backdoors and lightweight tools.
   - **Initial Access:** APT42 primarily uses spear phishing to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** APT42 establishes a foothold using various lightweight malware.
   - **Persistence:** APT42 uses custom malware for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT42 uses custom malware for privilege escalation.
   - **Credential Access:** APT42 steals credentials using methods like OS credential dumping and keylogging.
   - **Discovery:** APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT42 moves laterally using compromised accounts.
   - **Collection:** APT42 steals credentials and documents.
   - **Command and Control:** APT42 uses encrypted channels for C2 communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT42 exfiltrates data over C2 channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after APT42 used methods like obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from tools, which is not directly related to obfuscation and hiding artifacts.
   - **T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts for persistence, which is not related to obfuscation and hiding artifacts.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is not related to obfuscation and hiding artifacts.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which aligns with the methods mentioned in the question (obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows).

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
