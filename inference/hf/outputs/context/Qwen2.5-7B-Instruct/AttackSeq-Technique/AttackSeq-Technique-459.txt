Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The rootkit CEIDPageLock is distributed via the RIG Exploit kit.
   - **Persistence:** The rootkit drops a driver (houzi.sys) in the \Windows\Temp directory and registers it to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** The rootkit gathers browsing data.
   - **Command and Control:** The driver connects to C&C domains to download homepage configurations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurs when the driver connects to C&C domains to download homepage configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1216.002-SyncAppvPublishingServer:** This technique is about synchronizing application publishing server data, which does not match the context of connecting to C&C domains.
   - **T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature:** This technique involves using a code signature that is invalid or has been revoked, which is not directly related to connecting to C&C domains.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate or transfer data. Given that the driver connects to C&C domains to download data, this technique fits well.
   - **T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves using data from information repositories, which is not directly related to connecting to C&C domains.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly relates to the driver connecting to C&C domains to download homepage configurations.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
