Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The attack sequence described in the CTI outline includes:
1. **Initial Access**: Opening a malicious document via phishing email.
2. **Execution**: Executing VBS scripts and HTA files.
3. **Persistence**: Creating scheduled tasks to ensure the backdoor remains active.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Using mshta.exe and scheduled tasks to evade detection.
5. **Collection**: Deploying multiple variants of the VBS backdoor and executing VBS scripts.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Continued use of mshta.exe and scheduled tasks for evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique used to establish communication with Shuckworm's servers and download additional payloads after the collection phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to exfiltrate data or download payloads. Given the context of the attack, this could be a plausible method for establishing communication and downloading additional payloads.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While this could be used, it is less likely to be the primary method given the context of the attack.
- **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique is related to using container orchestration tools, which is not relevant to the described attack sequence.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute commands. While this is used for persistence, it is not the primary method for establishing communication and downloading additional payloads.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline involves the use of VBS scripts and scheduled tasks for persistence and evasion.
- The question specifically asks about establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads after the collection phase.
- Given the context, using standard application layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to establish communication and download additional payloads is the most plausible method.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
