Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack involved a spear-phishing email with a link to a Flash exploit.
   - **Execution:** The Flash exploit, 'show.swf', was designed to execute shellcode and install a payload.
   - **Payload Delivery:** The payload was extracted from an animated GIF image, named 'b.gif', which was retrieved from the same domains as the Flash exploit.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to avoid detection by embedding the payload in an animated GIF image after the execution of the Flash exploit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system. This is related to the initial execution of the Flash exploit but does not address the embedding of the payload in an animated GIF.
   - **T1218.007-Msiexec:** This technique involves using the Windows Installer service to execute malicious code. It is not related to embedding a payload in an animated GIF.
   - **T1552.006-Group Policy Preferences:** This technique involves using Group Policy to modify system settings. It is not related to embedding a payload in an animated GIF.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection. Embedding the payload in an animated GIF is a method to hide the payload and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the payload was extracted from an animated GIF image, which is a method to hide the payload.
   - The question asks about the technique used to avoid detection by embedding the payload in an animated GIF.
   - Among the given options, T1564-Hide Artifacts is the most relevant to the described technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
