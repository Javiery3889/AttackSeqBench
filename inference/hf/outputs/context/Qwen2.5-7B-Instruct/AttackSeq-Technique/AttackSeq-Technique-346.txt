To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain).
   - **Persistence:** The attackers maintained their foothold within the compromised networks (implied use of techniques to gain and maintain persistence).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used various techniques to avoid detection (T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after gaining initial access through a compromised software update, specifically focusing on executing code using system services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and analyzing processes to gather information about the system. While it is a Discovery technique, it does not directly relate to executing code using system services.
   - **T1070.009-Clear Persistence:** This technique involves maintaining access to a target system by creating or modifying files, registry entries, or other artifacts. While it is related to persistence, it does not specifically mention executing code using system services.
   - **T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:** These are specific tools used for automating tasks, but they are not directly related to the context of the question, which focuses on system services.
   - **T1569-System Services:** This technique involves using system services to execute code or perform actions. It directly aligns with the question's focus on executing code using system services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gained initial access through a supply chain compromise.
   - They then likely used a technique to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - The question specifically asks about executing code using system services, which is directly covered by T1569-System Services.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
