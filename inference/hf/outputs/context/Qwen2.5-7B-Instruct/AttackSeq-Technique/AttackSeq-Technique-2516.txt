Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use two vectors: compromising a public-facing web service and spearphishing emails.
   - **Post-Exploitation:** After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, the attackers map the network and collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - **Lateral Movement:** With domain administrator privileges, the attackers use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for lateral movement after obtaining domain administrator privileges.
   - The tools mentioned for lateral movement are SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.
