Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Tickusb infects systems via USB flash drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware avoids automatic execution upon system booting and only runs when certain files are executed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred following Tickusb's initial access via USB flash drives and before it employed tactics to evade detection by executing only when specific files are run.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tickusb's Initial Access**: The malware infects systems via USB flash drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware only runs when certain files are executed, making it difficult to detect.

We need to identify a technique that occurs after the initial infection via USB but before the evasion technique.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It does not fit the sequence as it is more about gaining access rather than the post-infection phase.
- **B: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. While it is related to the initial infection via USB, it does not fit the sequence as it is the initial access technique.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. This fits the sequence as it is a post-infection technique that could be used to spread or alter other programs, aligning with the malware's behavior of altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs.
- **D: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying containers to execute code. It does not fit the sequence as it is more about containerization rather than the specific behavior of Tickusb.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **T1129-Shared Modules**.

**Final Answer: C**
