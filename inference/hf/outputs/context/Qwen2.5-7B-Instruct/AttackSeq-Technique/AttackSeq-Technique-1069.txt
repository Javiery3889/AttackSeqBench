Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign used watering hole tactics with exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - **Execution:** The Chrome exploit vector involved a custom shellcode that downloaded and executed 'dropper.dll', which in turn downloaded and executed three additional malware samples.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware avoided execution if security software was detected.
   - **Discovery:** The SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect and exfiltrate system information and screenshots.
   - **Exfiltration:** The SLUB malware exfiltrated system information and screenshots to the Mattermost server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with the Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443 after exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the SLUB malware variant exfiltrated system information and screenshots to the Mattermost server.
   - The question specifies that the communication was using HTTP on port 443, which is a common method for web service communication.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data. Given that the communication is over HTTP on port 443, this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. While it is related, it is more general and does not specifically mention exfiltration.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration over HTTP.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring malware runs at boot or logon. It is not related to exfiltration.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The CTI outline clearly states that the SLUB malware exfiltrated data to a Mattermost server.
- The question specifies that the communication was over HTTP on port 443, which aligns with web service communication.
- Among the given choices, T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is the most specific and relevant technique for this scenario.

**Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
