Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to enumerate files for credential targeting.
   - **Persistence:** They use various techniques to maintain persistence, including registry keys and VBScripts.
   - **Credential Access:** They deploy njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' to target Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Collection:** They utilize modular plugins for specific malicious tasks, including file enumeration and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** They use Command and Control infrastructure to deliver malicious artifacts.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to retrieve Kavach authentication databases from infected devices after using GoLang-based file recon plugins and deploying malicious payloads via Command and Control infrastructure.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1601-Modify System Image:** This technique involves modifying the system image, which is not directly related to retrieving authentication databases.
   - **T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which is not the most direct method for retrieving authentication databases.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing information, which is not the method for retrieving authentication databases from infected devices.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data, which aligns with the context of retrieving Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of retrieving Kavach authentication databases from infected devices, is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
