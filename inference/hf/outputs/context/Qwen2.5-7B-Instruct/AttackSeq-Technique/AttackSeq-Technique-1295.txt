Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails and strategic Web compromises.
   - **Execution:** Poison Ivy builder kit is used to customize and build a Poison Ivy server, which is delivered via social engineering.
   - **Persistence:** A watchdog thread is injected into explorer.exe to ensure the Poison Ivy server process restarts if terminated.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key, often using port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher, which is a form of encryption. However, it does not explicitly mention a custom network protocol over TCP.
   - The question is asking for a specific ATT&CK technique that involves securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation** - This technique is about requesting multi-factor authentication, which is not related to securing network communications.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is not specifically about securing communication with a custom network protocol.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution** - This technique is about executing code based on events, which is not related to securing network communications.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to secure communications. Given that the CTI outline mentions encryption (Camellia cipher) and the question asks about securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP, this choice aligns best with the context provided.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
