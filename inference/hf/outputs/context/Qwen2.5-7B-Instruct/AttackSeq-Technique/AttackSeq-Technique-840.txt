Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: The malware executes and reads its configuration from a file.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs various methods to evade detection.
3. **Collection**: The malware collects data from the victim's PC.
4. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with C2 servers.
5. **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates the collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the malware discovered information about the infected PC and network configuration. This implies we need to identify a technique that would precede the collection of data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It is not directly related to discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.
- **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It is more about evading detection rather than discovering information.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the malware appear as legitimate software. It is also more about evading detection rather than discovering information.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system. This aligns with the malware discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware needs to discover information about the infected PC and network configuration before it can start collecting data.
- The technique that best fits this description is T1518-Software Discovery, as it involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system, which is a prerequisite for the malware to start collecting data.

### Final Answer: D: T1518-Software Discovery
