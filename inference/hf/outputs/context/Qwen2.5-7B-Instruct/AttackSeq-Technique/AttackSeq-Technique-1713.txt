Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Turla spyware infects government computers.
2. **Persistence**: Establishes a hidden foothold.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Uses encryption and rootkit capabilities to hide and store data.
4. **Command and Control**: Uses multiple command and control servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurs after the malware has used encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade defenses. The context suggests that the attackers are now gathering specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which of the given TTPs (Disk Content Wipe, Data from Network Shared Drive, Data from Information Repositories, Rootkit) aligns with the context of gathering specific information.

- **T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe**: This technique involves wiping disk content, which is not aligned with the context of gathering information.
- **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives. While it could be part of gathering information, it is not the most direct or likely technique after evading defenses.
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which is a direct and likely method for gathering specific information from systems.
- **T1014-Rootkit**: This technique involves using a rootkit, which is already mentioned in the context of defense evasion. It is not a new TTP but rather a continuation of the same tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the malware using encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade defenses and hide data.
- The next logical step would be to gather specific information from the systems to enhance the spying operation.
- Among the given options, **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** is the most plausible and relevant TTP for gathering specific information from systems.

### Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
