Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document.
   - **Execution:** The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document and contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878.
   - **Persistence:** The implant is designed to persist on the victim's network.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The implant is designed to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The implants communicate with control servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Bankshot implant exploited CVE-2018-4878 using an embedded Flash script.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1588.005-Exploits:** This technique involves the exploitation of a vulnerability. The Flash script exploiting CVE-2018-4878 is the exploit itself, so this is a direct action and not a preceding step.
   - **T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure for the attacker to use in the attack. It does not fit the sequence as it is not a step that precedes the exploit.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization. This is a common step in reconnaissance and initial access, which fits the sequence before the exploit.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to the network. It is not directly related to the exploit of the Flash script.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence starts with reconnaissance and initial access via spear phishing.
   - The next step is the execution of the exploit (CVE-2018-4878) using the embedded Flash script in the Word document.

Given the context and the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred before the exploit is the gathering of victim organization information.

**Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
