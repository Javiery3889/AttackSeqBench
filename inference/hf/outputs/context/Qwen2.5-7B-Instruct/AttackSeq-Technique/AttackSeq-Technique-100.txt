Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes an initial access technique where a spear-phishing email is sent to high-ranking officers. The email contains either a malicious RTF document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that exploits known vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, and CVE-2018-0802) to launch Equation Editor and run embedded objects containing shellcode. This sequence of events is part of the "Initial Access" tactic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 (Command and Control) server during communication. This is part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to match the provided answer choices with the context of the CTI outline and the question.

- **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. It could be used to obfuscate the C2 communication.
- **B: T1197-BITS Jobs** - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer data. It is not typically used for concealing C2 server identities.
- **C: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is not relevant to concealing C2 server identities.
- **D: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to hide the origin of traffic, it is not specifically about concealing the identity of the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes an attack that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in documents to gain initial access. The question asks about a technique to conceal the C2 server identity, which is part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
- Among the provided choices, T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding (A) is the most relevant to concealing the identity of the C2 server. This technique can be used to encode the C2 communication in a way that makes it harder to detect or trace back to the attacker.

### Final Answer: A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
