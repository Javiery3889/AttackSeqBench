Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Malware like RevengeRAT, NjRAT, etc., are downloaded and executed.
   - **Credential Access:** Stealing credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies, and selling credentials for remote access.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence:**
   - The sequence involves gaining remote access to hotel front desks, stealing credit card details, and then collecting additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after stealing credit card details to collect additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which doesn't align with monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves sending malicious content to trick users into providing information, which is not relevant to monitoring activities.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could be relevant to monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique involves deploying software to gain access or perform actions, which is not directly related to monitoring activities.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible technique for collecting additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities is T1213-Data from Information Repositories. This technique aligns with the need to gather data from various sources, including websites and systems, which is consistent with the described activities.

**Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
