Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key attack sequences and techniques:
- **Execution**: Use of DESLoader and DLL side-loading.
- **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks to execute DESLoader.
- **Defense Evasion**: Sophisticated techniques including fileless implants, removal of event logs, and obfuscated PowerShell commands.
- **Credential Access**: Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, use of administrator accounts, and deployment of tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials.
- **Discovery**: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
- **Lateral Movement**: Utilizing RDP for lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred before deploying tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials from systems post-initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. While it is related to execution, it does not directly pertain to gaining access or dumping credentials.
- **T1611-Escape to Host**: This technique involves escaping from a virtual environment or container to the host. It is not directly related to the initial access or credential dumping.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to the target network. This could be relevant if the attackers used external services to initially access the network, but the question is more focused on the immediate steps post-initial access.
- **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to the target network. It is a plausible initial access technique, but the question is more focused on the immediate steps post-initial access.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible technique that occurred before deploying tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials is likely related to the initial access and network scanning. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports after initial access via SSL-VPN. This scanning activity is a critical step before deploying tools to dump credentials.

Therefore, the most plausible technique is **T1133-External Remote Services**, as it aligns with the initial access via SSL-VPN and the subsequent network scanning activities.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
