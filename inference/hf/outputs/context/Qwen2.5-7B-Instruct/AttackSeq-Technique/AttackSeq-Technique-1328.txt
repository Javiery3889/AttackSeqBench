Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
   - **Execution:** CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and system information.
   - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns on the system.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers to collect sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the transfer of collected information to remote servers after using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique is not relevant as the information is not being transferred to removable media.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique is about gathering network information, not transferring collected data.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data to an external location, which aligns with the question.
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which matches the described method of using HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav.

Given the context of the CTI outline, CosmicDuke uses HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltrating collected data. This directly aligns with the T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
