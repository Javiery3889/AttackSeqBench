Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign involved reconnaissance activities using vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube (CVE-2020-35730) and Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397).
   - **Execution:** Malicious scripts were executed through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube, redirecting emails and performing reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The campaign used obfuscation and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The campaign conducted discovery activities by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube to gather system and network information.
   - **Collection:** Emails were collected using Roundcube's managesieve plugin.
   - **Command and Control:** Web protocols were used for C2 activities.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data, including session cookies and address book information, was exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the discovery of system and network information but before securing sensitive victim credentials such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. This would be after the discovery phase and after securing sensitive credentials.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the target's network configuration. This aligns with the discovery phase.
   - **T1547.014-Active Setup:** This technique involves setting up a system to perform actions automatically. This is not directly related to the discovery phase.
   - **T1187-Forced Authentication:** This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a service. This is not directly related to the discovery phase.

Given the context of the question, the technique that fits the sequence after discovery but before securing sensitive credentials is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
