Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides information about different campaigns and the use of Sakula malware. Key points include:
- The INOCNATION Campaign used Sakula malware with C2 communications to the domain `inocnation[.]com`.
- The Ironman Campaign used Sakula malware with C2 communications to the IP address `180.210.206.246`.
- The French Aerospace Campaign used Sakula malware with C2 communications to the domain `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.
- Sakula malware has been linked to the use of zero-day exploits and has been involved in significant targeted intrusion campaigns.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a first stage downloader (saving a file at `%Temp%/Rdws.exe`) later retrieves a second stage PlugX file. The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access through a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This technique involves sending a malicious payload via a service or application. However, the question does not mention any service or application being used for spearphishing.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the method of gaining access through a compromised website.
- **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It is not directly related to the method of gaining access through a compromised website.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by tricking them into visiting a malicious website. This aligns well with the scenario where a user visits a compromised website (spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities") and gets redirected to a malicious download.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes a user visiting a compromised website that spoofs the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".
- The user is tricked into downloading a file (`%Temp%/Rdws.exe`), which is a common method used in drive-by compromises.
- The file later retrieves a second stage PlugX file, indicating a multi-stage attack.

Given the context of the question and the options provided, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access through the compromised website is **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.

**Final Answer: D**
