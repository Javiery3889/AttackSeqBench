Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on iOS devices, specifically targeting iOS 7 and earlier.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app runs in the background, collects various types of data, and can restart automatically.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitates uploading files via FTP to the C2 server after the XAgent app has collected the information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention FTP or any specific technique for uploading files. However, it does indicate that the malware collects various types of data and likely transmits this data to a C2 server.
   - **T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves executing code or programs on the system. It does not directly relate to file transfer.
   - **T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves rapidly changing DNS records to evade detection. It is not related to file transfer.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves using legitimate system features to gain elevated privileges. It is not related to file transfer.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or data from an external system to the target network. While it does not specifically mention FTP, it is the closest to the context of transferring collected data to a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware collects various types of data and needs to transmit this data to a C2 server.
   - Among the given options, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant as it involves transferring tools or data from an external system to the target network, which aligns with the need to upload collected data to a C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
