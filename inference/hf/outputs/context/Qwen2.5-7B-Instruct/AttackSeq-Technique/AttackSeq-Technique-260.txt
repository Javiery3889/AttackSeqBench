Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The outline mentions that the attackers are using Sliver to maintain access after compromising a network.
   - It also notes that attackers are scanning for vulnerable instances of Apache Log4j, indicating an initial access phase.
   - The context provided does not directly mention the initial access phase but provides information about the attackers' activities, including the use of Sliver for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access phase, specifically after abusing Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - The question is looking for a technique that would be used to compromise external remote services during the initial access phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging:** This technique involves modifying legitimate processes to hide malicious activity. It does not directly relate to compromising external remote services.
   - **T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts to gain access. It is not directly related to the context of using Cloud Shell and reverse SSH tunneling.
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which is not directly related to the context of the question.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection or to exfiltrate data. Given that the question mentions abusing Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, this technique aligns well with the context of compromising external remote services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers are using Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, which is a method to establish a connection to an external remote service.
   - The question asks for a technique that would be used to compromise external remote services during the initial access phase.
   - T1133-External Remote Services directly aligns with the use of reverse SSH tunneling to establish a connection to an external remote service.

**Final Answer: D: T1133-External Remote Services**
