Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
   - **Initial Access:** They exploit a year-old Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** They deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
   - **Persistence:** POWERSHOWER sets up persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use anti-forensics techniques.
   - **Discovery:** POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after POWERSHOWER collected system information and transmitted it to the C2 server, a technique was used to utilize a proxy for communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about a technique that would be used after the initial communication with the C2 server.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a proxy being used for communications, but it does mention defense evasion techniques, which could include using a proxy to mask the traffic.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy
     - B: T1090-Proxy
     - C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture
     - D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the traffic and make it harder to trace.
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This is a broader technique that involves using a proxy to route traffic.
   - **T1056.002-GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not relevant to the question.

Given the context of the question and the CTI outline, the most plausible technique that would be used to utilize a proxy for communications after the initial transmission of system information to the C2 server is T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy, as it provides the most robust method of obfuscation and evasion.

**Final Answer: A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
