Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack campaign, 'ProjectM,' targeted Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites.
   - **Initial Access:** The actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The campaign used Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, as well as RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok, to execute malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The campaign utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal infrastructure.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection, and two domains were linked to an individual's email address, hosting C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks how ProjectM developed its capabilities after conducting reconnaissance by targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543.005-Container Service** - This TTP is not directly related to the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, which focuses on initial access, execution, and C2 infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1584.008-Network Devices** - This TTP involves the use of network devices for command and control, which is part of the C2 infrastructure but not the development of capabilities.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This TTP aligns with the development of the campaign's capabilities, including the use of various tools and techniques such as Trojans, RATs, and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - While gathering victim identity information is a part of reconnaissance, the question specifically asks about the development of capabilities after reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes the use of spear-phishing, watering hole attacks, and the deployment of various tools and techniques to execute the campaign.
   - The development of these capabilities involves the use of Trojans, RATs, and exploitation of vulnerabilities, which aligns with the T1587-Develop Capabilities TTP.
   - The other choices do not directly address the development of the campaign's capabilities after reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
