Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on iOS devices, specifically targeting iOS 7 and earlier versions.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs in the background and collects various types of information from the device.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other device information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that facilitates communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests after the malware has gathered information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any C2 communication or the use of POST and GET requests. However, the context of the malware gathering information and communicating with a C2 server is implied.
   - **T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique is used to manipulate network traffic, which is not directly related to C2 communication using HTTP methods.
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with the use of POST and GET requests.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique is about discovering software on the target system, which is already covered in the malware's capabilities.
   - **T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves sending junk data to overwhelm or confuse the target, which is not relevant to the described C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware is designed to gather information and communicate with a C2 server.
   - The question specifies the use of POST and GET requests, which are HTTP methods commonly used in web services.
   - T1102-Web Service is the only technique that directly involves using web services for communication, which aligns with the described C2 communication method.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
