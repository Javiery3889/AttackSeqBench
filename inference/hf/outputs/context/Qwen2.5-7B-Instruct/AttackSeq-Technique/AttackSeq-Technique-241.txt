Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Lazarus group used a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application (Celas Trade Pro) to deliver the Fallchill malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware included an updater module that collected system information and communicated with the C2 server.
   - **Persistence:** The malware installed a hidden 'autoupdater' module.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used encryption and mimicked legitimate network traffic to avoid detection.
   - **Impact:** The operation, AppleJeus, compromised a cryptocurrency exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that facilitated communication between the malware and the C2 server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string, after the malware had already evaded defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique is about stealing financial information, which does not match the context of the question.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish C2 communication. It fits the context of using HTTP for communication.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique is about using symmetric encryption, which is a method of encryption, not a communication technique.
   - **T1204.001-Malicious Link:** This technique involves using malicious links to deliver malware or exfiltrate data, which does not match the context of the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the communication uses HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string, which aligns with the use of an application layer protocol.
   - The technique T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant as it directly addresses the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
