Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Persistence:** The app auto-starts at device boot.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects device information and GPS location.
   - **Collection:** The app exfiltrates various types of data.
   - **Command and Control:** The app contacts the C&C server and sends exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the app targeted Arabic-speaking Android users through a dedicated website but before it ensured its functionality was activated every time the device started.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves the collection of system location data, which is part of the collection phase in the CTI outline.
   - **T1593.001-Social Media:** This technique involves the use of social media for malicious purposes, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which could be related to the dedicated website used to distribute the app.

Given the sequence in the CTI outline:
- The app was targeted through a dedicated website (pre-persistence).
- The app then collected device information and GPS location (discovery).
- The app ensured its functionality was activated every time the device started (persistence).

The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. Targeting through a dedicated website (pre-persistence).
2. Collecting device information and GPS location (discovery).

Among the given choices, **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** (which is the same as the provided answer choice D) is the most relevant to the targeted distribution through a dedicated website.

**Final Answer: D**
