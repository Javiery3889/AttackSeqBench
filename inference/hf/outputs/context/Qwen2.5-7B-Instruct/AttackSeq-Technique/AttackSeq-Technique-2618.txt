Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use fake mobile applications to entice victims.
   - **Collection:** The malware embedded in these applications collects sensitive data from the victims' devices.
   - **Transmission:** The stolen data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for transmitting stolen data back to the attackers' infrastructure via HTTP POST requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves the use of bidirectional communication channels, which is not specifically about the HTTP POST request but rather the nature of the communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which is relevant to the HTTP POST request as it is an application layer protocol.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves the use of valid accounts to gain access to systems, which is not relevant to the transmission of data via HTTP POST.
   - **T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS:** This technique involves the use of rapidly changing DNS records to hide the location of the C&C servers, which is not relevant to the HTTP POST request.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the attackers are using HTTP POST requests to transmit stolen data to their C&C servers. This directly aligns with the use of an application layer protocol (HTTP) to transmit data, which is covered by the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
