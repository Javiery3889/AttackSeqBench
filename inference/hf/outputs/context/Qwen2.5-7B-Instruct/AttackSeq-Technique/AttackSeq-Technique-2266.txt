Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack targets Mexican banking institutions and is linked to a Brazilian campaign.
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing email from the Mexican tax department.
   - **Execution:** The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file triggers a PowerShell script that downloads and executes the main malware.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals bank credentials and Outlook email accounts.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects email accounts from the contacts list.
   - **Command and Control:** The script communicates with C2 domains to download malware and send collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST request.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that hinders static analysis through file obfuscation after the PowerShell script communicates with C2 domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1547.010-Port Monitors:** This technique involves monitoring network ports, which is not related to file obfuscation.
   - **T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls:** This technique involves tracing system calls, which is also not related to file obfuscation.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the base64 encoded text strings in the PowerShell script.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which is related to the execution of the PowerShell script but not specifically to file obfuscation.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the PowerShell script includes base64 encoded text strings, which are a form of obfuscation. The technique that directly addresses this form of obfuscation is T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.

**Final Answer: C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
