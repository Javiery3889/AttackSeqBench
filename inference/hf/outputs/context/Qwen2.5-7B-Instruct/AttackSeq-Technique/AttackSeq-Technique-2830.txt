Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing email delivering a CAB archive named 1-10-20-hb44_final.
2. **Execution**: Malicious loader (1-10-20-hb44_final.exe) retrieves and executes BlackSoul and blacksoulLib.
3. **Defense Evasion**: BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques.
4. **Credential Access**: DLL (blacksoulLib) searches for browser data, decodes C2 URLs, and returns data to BlackSoul.
5. **Collection**: BlackSoul supports file transfers and command execution.
6. **Command and Control**: BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server over RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding. This implies that the technique involves data transfer over the C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**: This technique involves using a Golden Ticket to gain unauthorized access to network resources. It does not fit the context of data transfer over a C2 channel.
- **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol, which does not align with the C2 communication described.
- **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which could fit the context of transferring data over the C2 channel.
- **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving collected data, which could also fit the context of transferring data over the C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes that BlackSoul supports file transfers and running arbitrary commands, which aligns with the collection and exfiltration of data.
- The question specifically asks about the technique that most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel after establishing communication.
- Both T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1560-Archive Collected Data could fit, but T1020-Automated Exfiltration is more directly related to the automated transfer of data, which is a common TTP in C2 communication.

### Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
