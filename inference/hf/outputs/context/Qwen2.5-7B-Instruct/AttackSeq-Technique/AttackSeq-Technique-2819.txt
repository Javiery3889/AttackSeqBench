Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary obtained SSH access and used `wget` to download malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware (Derusbi) loads a custom loader and drops a Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) into the kernel.
   - **Persistence:** The Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The LKM employs cloaking and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information and sends it back to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after Derusbi gathered system information, it established communication with the C2 server via HTTP POST requests to `/photos/photo.asp`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique is about gathering system information, which is already mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication:** This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, which aligns with the question's description of HTTP POST requests.
   - **T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call:** This technique is about making asynchronous calls, which is not relevant to the HTTP POST request described.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is relevant to the HTTP POST request, but it does not specifically address the bidirectional communication aspect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes the malware gathering system information (T1082) and then establishing communication with the C2 server.
   - The question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests, which are a form of bidirectional communication.
   - T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the bidirectional communication established via HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
