Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
1. **Execution**: Babar uses a dropper to fetch and decrypt a DLL, which is then loaded using `regsvr32.exe`.
2. **Persistence**: Babar ensures persistence by creating a registry key that executes `regsvr32.exe` at boot time.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The dropper and implant use various methods to reduce forensic artifacts, including deleting the dropper binary and API name obfuscation.
4. **Command and Control**: Babar communicates with C&C servers through a remote thread injection technique.
5. **Exfiltration**: Babar compresses and encrypts data before exfiltrating it.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Babar's dropper used global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots. This implies that the technique should be related to the actions taken by the implant after it has gained access to the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves the use of inter-process communication mechanisms to exfiltrate data. While this could be a part of the exfiltration process, it is not directly related to the logging and capturing of keystrokes and screenshots.
- **T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**: This technique involves using SNMP to exfiltrate data. Again, this is not directly related to the logging and capturing of keystrokes and screenshots.
- **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the description of logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots.
- **T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves using or resolving domains for C2 communication. This is related to the command and control process, not the logging and capturing of keystrokes and screenshots.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The dropper and implant are described as using global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications, enabling them to log keystrokes and capture screenshots.
- The T1056-Input Capture technique directly aligns with the logging of keystrokes and capturing of screenshots, as it involves capturing user input.
- The other techniques (T1559, T1602.001, and T1583.001) are not directly related to the specific actions of logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots.

### Final Answer: C: T1056-Input Capture
