Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Social engineering via email attachments or reports.
2. **Execution**: Malicious documents with embedded macros that download and execute the Pierogi backdoor.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques to evade detection, such as querying for antivirus software and using file deletion and software packing.
4. **Discovery**: Collecting information about the infected machine.
5. **Collection**: Taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands.
6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with C2 servers.
7. **Exfiltration**: Uploading data such as screenshots to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that ensures the Pierogi backdoor runs upon user login after being downloaded and executed via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify a technique that would ensure the backdoor runs automatically when the user logs in. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**: This technique involves using a Terminal Services DLL to load a malicious payload. It is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves placing malware in locations that are executed when the system boots or when a user logs in. This is a strong candidate as it directly addresses the need to run the backdoor upon user login.
- **C: T1098.005-Device Registration**: This technique involves registering a device with a network or service. It is not relevant to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
- **D: T1098.005-Device Registration**: This is the same as C and is not relevant to the context of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the execution of the Pierogi backdoor via an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document.
- The question asks about a technique that ensures the backdoor runs upon user login.
- Among the given choices, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** (B) is the most relevant and plausible technique for ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

### Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
