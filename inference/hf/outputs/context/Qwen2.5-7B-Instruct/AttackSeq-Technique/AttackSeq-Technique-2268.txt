Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a detailed sequence of TTPs, including:
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack targets Mexican banking institutions.
2. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, containing a malicious attachment.
3. **Execution**: The malicious .bat file triggers the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads the main malware library and other components.
4. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses VMProtect to protect itself and includes obfuscation techniques.
6. **Credential Access**: The malware steals bank credentials and collects email accounts.
7. **Collection**: The malware accesses Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts.
8. **Exfiltration**: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data. The key points are:
- The PowerShell script downloads the main malware library and other components.
- The script also includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most relevant to the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data.

- **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass external network controls. It is not directly related to the communication with external domains.
- **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the communication with external domains.
- **T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email addresses or other email-related information. It is not directly related to the communication with external domains.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with external domains. This is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the communication with external domains to download malware and send collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The PowerShell script is responsible for downloading the main malware library and other components from external domains.
- The script also includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence, which is a form of communication with external domains.
- The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with external domains.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
