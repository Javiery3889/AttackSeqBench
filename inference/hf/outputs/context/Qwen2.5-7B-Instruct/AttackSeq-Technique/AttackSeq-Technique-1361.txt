Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack leveraged the CVE-2015-5119 exploit to download and execute `%Temp%/Rdws.exe`.
   - **Execution:** The `%Temp%/Rdws.exe` file was used as a first stage downloader.
   - **Persistence:** The first stage downloader retrieved a second-stage PlugX file.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The PlugX file connected to C2 domains such as `cdn.sanecat.com`.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with C2 domains after the execution of `%Temp%/Rdws.exe` and the retrieval of the second-stage PlugX file.
   - The C2 domains mentioned are `inocnation.com`.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other data. It is not directly related to communication with C2 domains.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with C2 servers. This is a plausible method for communication with C2 domains.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. It is not relevant to the communication with C2 domains.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves collecting data from the local system. It is not related to the communication with C2 domains.

Given the context of the attack, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with C2 domains such as `inocnation.com` is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique aligns with the use of application layer protocols to establish and maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
