Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
   - **Execution:** Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor collects a wide range of data, including system information.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with a C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltration of collected data.
   - **Impact:** Capability to shut down the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques and before collecting detailed system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard:** This technique involves using a cloud service dashboard to manage or exfiltrate data. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the immediate collection of system information.
   - **T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other data. It is not directly related to the collection of system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses. This fits the sequence as it is the next step after evading detection and before collecting detailed information.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots. While it is a form of data collection, it is not the most likely technique to be used immediately after evading detection and before collecting detailed system information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The attackers first evade detection using anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
- The next logical step would be to gather detailed information about the victim's system, which is the primary objective of T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
