Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files.
- **Execution**: The '.lnk' files contained embedded HTA scripts that executed various operations, including dropping Cobalt Strike Stagers and opening decoy documents.
- **Command and Control**: The campaign involved C2 domains and IP addresses for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1036 - Masquerading**: This technique involves making malicious artifacts appear to be legitimate. However, the CTI outline does not mention any specific artifacts being masqueraded.
- **T1070.006 - Timestomp**: This technique involves altering the file timestamps to make the file appear legitimate. The CTI outline does not mention any file timestamp manipulation.
- **T1647 - Plist File Modification**: This technique involves modifying macOS property list (plist) files. The CTI outline does not mention any plist files.
- **T1566 - Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing actions that compromise security, such as opening malicious files or clicking on links.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- The CTI outline clearly states that Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files to deliver Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX.
- Spearphishing is a form of social engineering where attackers use emails or other communication methods to trick users into performing actions that compromise security.
- The '.lnk' files were designed to deceive users into executing the malicious scripts, which aligns with the definition of phishing.

### Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
