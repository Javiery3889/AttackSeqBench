Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate.
   - **Execution:** APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable the command prompt by copying and patching `cmd.exe`.
   - **Persistence:** The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Credential Access:** APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
   - **Collection:** APT15 used various tools to extract data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after APT15 evaded policy settings disabling the command prompt by copying and patching `cmd.exe`, particularly facilitating the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable:** This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to intercept and manipulate system calls. It is not directly related to evading policy settings or facilitating persistent installation.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves degrading, disrupting, or removing defensive measures. It aligns with the idea of evading policy settings and facilitating persistent installation.
   - **T1556.005-Reversible Encryption:** This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect data. It is not directly related to evading policy settings or facilitating persistent installation.
   - **T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:** This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates. It is not directly related to evading policy settings or facilitating persistent installation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The RoyalCLI backdoor bypasses policy settings by copying and patching `cmd.exe`, which is a form of evading defensive measures.
   - The persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor is a result of this evasion.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with this sequence is T1562-Impair Defenses, as it directly addresses the evasion of policy settings and the subsequent persistent installation.

**Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
