Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Welcome Chat app is used to gain initial access to the victim's device.
   - **Persistence:** The app ensures it starts automatically at boot.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects device information and GPS location.
   - **Collection:** The app exfiltrates SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the app exfiltrated the data mentioned (SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves the attacker discovering the geographic location of the target system. While the app does collect GPS data, this technique is more about the discovery process rather than the exfiltration of data.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves the attacker subverting or bypassing controls that are intended to protect the system. This could be relevant if the app was designed to bypass security measures, but the question is specifically about the exfiltration of data.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the attacker using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. Given that the app is exfiltrating various types of data, this technique fits well as it describes the method of data exfiltration.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves the attacker using a protocol to tunnel data through another protocol. While this could be a method of exfiltration, the question does not specify that the data is being tunneled through another protocol.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The app has already collected and exfiltrated the data.
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred after this exfiltration.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant because it directly describes the method of exfiltrating the collected data.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
