Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities and malvertising to deliver exploits.
   - **Initial Access:** RIG EK uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.
   - **Execution:** RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - **Defense Evasion:** RIG EK uses proxy servers and an integrated Antivirus testing feature.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for Command and Control (C2) to securely transmit exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm after the execution phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is focused on the C2 phase, specifically on secure communication techniques.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
     - B: T1205-Traffic Signaling
     - C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking
     - D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel (A):** This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain C2 communications. Given that RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm to encrypt the exploit code, this technique fits well.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling (B):** This technique is about signaling to establish a C2 channel, which is not directly related to encryption.
   - **T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking (C):** This technique is about modifying the search path to load malicious code, which is not related to C2 communication.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy (D):** This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic, which is not the same as using encryption.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it directly addresses the secure transmission of exploit code using encryption.

Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
