Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Employed techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
4. **Discovery**: Used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning.
5. **Collection**: Archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
6. **Command and Control**: Communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL encryption.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer the data from the victim's system after the data was archived in a custom storage file format.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question focuses on the transfer of data from the victim's system. The CTI outline mentions that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. This indicates that the data was likely exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Data Transfer Method**: The CTI outline states that the SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. This implies that the data was transferred over the C2 channel.
2. **Match with ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using a USB device, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules, which is not relevant to data exfiltration.
   - **T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves manipulating domain properties, which is not related to data exfiltration.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the CTI outline's description of the SombRAT backdoor communicating with C2 servers.

### Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
