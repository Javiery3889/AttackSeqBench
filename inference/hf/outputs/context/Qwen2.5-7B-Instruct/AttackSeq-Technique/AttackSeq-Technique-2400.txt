Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The malware gathered system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** Malware named TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Process hollowing and obfuscation of the second-stage payload.
   - **Command and Control:** Encrypted and encoded commands communicated with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware gathered system information, including task lists (which are related to active processes).
   - The ATT&CK technique that specifically targets the discovery of active processes is **T1057-Process Discovery**.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - After the execution and evasion techniques, the malware would need to gather information about the active processes on the infected host to understand the environment and possibly identify and manipulate running processes.
   - T1057-Process Discovery is the technique that best fits this scenario, as it involves identifying and gathering information about running processes.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery
