Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign used malicious documents to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents were used to deliver the Sharpshooter downloader.
   - **Execution:** The macro in winword.exe downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control:** The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence and before it communicated with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control:** The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to find a technique that fits between these two steps.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network connections, which is not directly related to the persistence or command and control steps.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is not directly related to the persistence or command and control steps.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network configuration details, which is not directly related to the persistence or command and control steps.
   - **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay** - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic, which could be used to establish a foothold or maintain persistence, but it is more related to network manipulation rather than the specific steps of persistence and command and control.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the Rising Sun implant ensuring persistence and then executing commands or scripts to maintain control. The technique that best fits this sequence is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**, as it directly relates to the execution of commands or scripts, which is a common step between persistence and command and control.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
