Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** DRAGONFISH distributes Elise malware through a malicious Word document.
   - **Execution:** Elise malware starts the Internet Explorer process, injects NavShExt.dll, and calls its export function 'Setting'.
   - **Persistence:** The malware uses the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD to achieve persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware employs various techniques, including heavy anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscation, and spoofing.
   - **Discovery:** The malware harvests system information.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used when the malware communicated with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands after establishing persistence.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.
   - The question is specifically asking about the technique used for this communication.

4. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is about evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness** - This technique is about exploiting weak file permissions on services, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port** - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be a plausible method to avoid detection.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication, which is a common method to blend in with normal traffic.

Given the context of the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible technique for the malware to communicate with the C2 server is using a standard application layer protocol to blend in with normal traffic. This is a common method to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
