Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files.
   - **Execution:** '.lnk' files contained embedded HTA scripts that dropped Cobalt Strike Stagers and opened decoy documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) and use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after the initial access and defense evasion steps.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions Cobalt Strike Stagers, which are typically used for establishing a persistent presence and maintaining access to the compromised system.
   - Cobalt Strike is known for its ability to communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2) server using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and other application layer protocols.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols for C2 communication. Cobalt Strike often uses HTTP/HTTPS for this purpose.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While this could be used in conjunction with communication, it is not the primary method for establishing and maintaining communication.
   - **C: T1010-Application Window Discovery** - This technique involves discovering and interacting with application windows. This is not related to communication but rather to user interaction.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. This is part of the initial access but not the communication method.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the CTI outline and the nature of Cobalt Strike's communication methods, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
