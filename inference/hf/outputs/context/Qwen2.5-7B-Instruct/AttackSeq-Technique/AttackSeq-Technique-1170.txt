Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Longhorn uses zero-day exploits and backdoor Trojans.
- **Defense Evasion**: Longhorn employs various techniques to avoid detection, including in-memory string de-obfuscation, secure erase protocols, and custom cryptographic protocols for C&C communications.
- **Discovery and Collection**: Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting and extensive command and control capabilities.
- **Command and Control**: Longhorn configures specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers, using privacy services and a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection after setting up communication with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing data in memory rather than on disk. It is not directly related to external communication or maintaining operational security through C&C communications.
- **T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves scheduling data transfers at specific times. While it could be used to avoid detection, it is not the most direct technique for maintaining operational security through C&C communications.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect communications. Given that Longhorn uses a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communications, this technique aligns closely with the described TTP.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that Longhorn uses a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communications to protect data from identification.
- The question asks about a technique to maintain operational security and avoid detection during external communication.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel directly aligns with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communications, which is a key aspect of maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.

### Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
