Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a strategic web compromise (SWC) of the Daily NK website, where malicious code was present from late March 2021 until early June 2021. The attackers modified legitimate files to redirect users to attacker-owned domains hosting malicious JavaScript, leveraging exploits such as CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.
   - **Command and Control:** The BLUELIGHT malware uses cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, collecting and uploading reconnaissance data, and receiving commands through the 'background' subdirectory.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 during the strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of web-based vulnerabilities.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. This aligns with the use of web-based exploits (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) to compromise the Daily NK website.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection. It is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase, after the initial compromise.
   - **T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves accessing NTDS.dit files, which is more relevant to post-exploitation activities, such as accessing domain controller information, rather than the initial compromise phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the technique in question occurs after the initial web-based compromise but before the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
   - The use of web-based exploits (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) to compromise the Daily NK website is a form of exploiting a public-facing application, which aligns with T1190.
   - T1190 directly corresponds to the exploitation phase, which is the correct sequence before moving to the C2 phase using Microsoft Graph API.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
