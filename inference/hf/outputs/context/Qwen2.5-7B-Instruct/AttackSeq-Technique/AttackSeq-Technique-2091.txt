Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
From the CTI outline, we can extract the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
2. **Execution**: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, and delete files.
3. **Persistence**: Establish persistence using a backdoor from the C2 server.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Compromise admin-level credentials.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Perform operations outside business hours, limit interaction to a handful of systems, and use single workstations as a hub.
6. **Lateral Movement**: Move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations.
7. **Collection**: Collect and prepare valuable documents for exfiltration.
8. **Command and Control**: Use Cobalt Strike beacon for C2.
9. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrate documents related to internal applications and procedures.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the Cobalt Strike beacon was used to map the organization's internal network and enumerate remote systems but before lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Cobalt Strike Beacon Usage**: The question mentions that the Cobalt Strike beacon was used to map the network and enumerate remote systems. This aligns with the **Command and Control** phase.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question specifies that the technique in question occurred before lateral movement.

Given the sequence, the technique that fits between the use of Cobalt Strike beacon for mapping and lateral movement is likely to be a technique that involves gathering information about the network or systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1652-Device Driver Discovery**: This technique involves discovering device drivers, which is not directly related to mapping the network or enumerating systems.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping OS credentials, which is more related to privilege escalation.
- **T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions, which is not directly related to mapping the network.
- **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the use of Cobalt Strike to map the network and enumerate remote systems.

### Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery
