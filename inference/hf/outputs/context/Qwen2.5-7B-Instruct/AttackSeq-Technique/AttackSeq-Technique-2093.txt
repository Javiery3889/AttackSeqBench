Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a series of TTPs in the following order:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Collection of data on banking applications and internal procedures.
2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
3. **Execution**: Download and execution of new payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files.
4. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence using a backdoor.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Finding admin-level credentials and compromising a Domain Administrator account.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Minimizing detection by operating outside business hours and using single workstations.
7. **Credential Access**: Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
8. **Discovery**: Using Cobalt Strike to discover and map the internal network, collecting administrative credentials.
9. **Lateral Movement**: Moving laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations.
10. **Command and Control**: Using Cobalt Strike for command and control.
11. **Exfiltration**: Preparing documents for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred after the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question mentions "after they compromised numerous workstations and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information." This aligns with the **Discovery** and **Lateral Movement** phases described in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise. It does not fit the context of searching for critical information.
- **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves accessing data from information repositories. While it could be relevant, it is not the most direct action after lateral movement.
- **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. This is a plausible action after compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers to gather critical information.
- **D: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**: This technique involves spoofing DHCP to redirect traffic. It is not directly related to the search for critical information.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information is **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**.

**Final Answer: C**
