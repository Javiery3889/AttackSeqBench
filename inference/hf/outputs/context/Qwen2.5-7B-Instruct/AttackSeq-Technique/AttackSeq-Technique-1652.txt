Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
- **Persistence**: February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain Initial Access and before securing alternative means of Persistence on victim systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
- **Persistence**: The group began securing alternative means of persistence in February 2014.

We need to find a TTP that fits between these two points in time and is relevant to the attack sequence.

### Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1596.002-WHOIS**
  - WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is used to query databases to obtain information about Internet domain names and IP addresses. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of vulnerabilities or gaining access.
  
- **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - Drive-by compromise involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This could be relevant if the attack involved a watering hole attack, but the CTI outline specifically mentions an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, which is more direct and specific.
  
- **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - Phishing for information involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. The CTI outline mentions that the group attempted to gather user credentials through several different phishing domains, which aligns with this TTP.
  
- **D: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification**
  - Code signing policy modification involves changing the security policies to allow unsigned code to run. This is not directly related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability or gaining access.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The attack leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, which is a direct method of gaining Initial Access.
- The next step, before securing persistence, would likely be to gather user credentials, as this would provide the attackers with valuable information and potentially allow them to maintain access.
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the group attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information
