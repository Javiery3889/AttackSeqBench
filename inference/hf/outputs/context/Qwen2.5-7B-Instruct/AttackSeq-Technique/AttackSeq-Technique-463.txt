Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The outline mentions that Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations, and the Bankshot malware is observed in the Turkish financial system.
- **Resource Development**: The Bankshot implant is developed and distributed from a malicious domain.
- **Execution**: The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document that exploits a Flash script to download and execute the implant.
- **Persistence**: The implant is designed to persist on the victim's network.
- **Defense Evasion**: The implant evades detection and persists on the network.
- **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing malware or other tools. While the outline mentions the development of the Bankshot implant, it does not specify this as the initial access technique.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to support the attack. The outline mentions the use of a malicious domain, but this is not the initial access technique.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's systems. The outline does not mention this specific technique.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. The outline describes the use of a malicious Word document as the initial access vector, which is a form of phishing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document, which is a form of spear phishing.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before gaining initial access using a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document.
- T1566-Phishing is the most relevant technique as it directly describes the use of a malicious document to deliver malware.

### Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
