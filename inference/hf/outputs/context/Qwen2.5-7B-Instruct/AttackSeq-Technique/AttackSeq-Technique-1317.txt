Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits.
- **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service.
- **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
- **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that most likely occurred after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. The options provided are:
- A: T1025-Data from Removable Media
- B: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication
- C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting
- D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves copying data to or from a removable medium. The CTI outline does not mention any exfiltration via removable media.
- **T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique involves using multiple authentication factors. The CTI outline does not mention any multi-factor authentication.
- **T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to hide the true destination of network traffic. The CTI outline does not mention any domain fronting.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. The CTI outline states that the collected information is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the collected information is exfiltrated via FTP.
- FTP is an application layer protocol, which aligns with T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
- None of the other techniques (T1025, T1556.006, T1090.004) are mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
