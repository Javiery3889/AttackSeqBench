Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents with macros to deliver the payload.
- **Execution**: The payload creates files in the ProgramData directory and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script, which is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- **Persistence**: The VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
- **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script uses obfuscation and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
- **Discovery**: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- **Command and Control**: Communication with the C&C server is done via XML messages, and the backdoor collects system information and sends it to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the backdoor function gathered machine information during the Discovery phase to further extract visual data from the victim's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or other visual data from the victim's system.
- **T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or to perform actions.
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to perform actions.
- **T1213.001-Confluence**: This technique involves using the Confluence application to perform actions.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots. This directly aligns with the T1113-Screen Capture technique.
- The other techniques (T1588.006-Vulnerabilities, T1102-Web Service, and T1213.001-Confluence) do not specifically mention the collection of visual data or screenshots.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1113-Screen Capture.

**Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture**
