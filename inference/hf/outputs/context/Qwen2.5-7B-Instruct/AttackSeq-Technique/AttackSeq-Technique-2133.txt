Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the attack sequence as follows:
1. **Initial Access**: Delivery of an ISO file containing a zip with malicious scripts.
2. **Execution**: Execution of various VBScripts and batch files.
3. **Persistence**: Scheduling of 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes.
4. **Discovery**: Collection of information about the user's computer.
5. **Collection**: Gathering of various information from the user's computer.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with a C2 server.
7. **Exfiltration**: Sending of collected data through a POST request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before 'stopedge.bat' deleted 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'. The key point here is the deletion of these files, which suggests a technique related to hiding or removing evidence of the attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves changing the system time to avoid detection. It does not fit the context of deleting files.
- **T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique involves bypassing security controls. It does not fit the context of deleting files.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. It does not fit the context of deleting files.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. It fits the context of deleting files to remove evidence of the attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'stopedge.bat' file is responsible for managing file deletions, which is a form of indicator removal.
- The deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' is a clear example of removing evidence of the attack.
- T1070-Indicator Removal is the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for this action.

### Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
