Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** Targets publicly facing web servers, uses both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan with main executable and DLL components.
   - **Persistence:** Installation of Explosive with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hides from detection tools, changes versions and builds, and uses custom configurations.
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** Multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, specifically after leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain administrator passwords, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers utilized writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The key sequence in the question is: Keylogging to gain administrator passwords, followed by the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection.
   - We need to find a TTP that logically precedes the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking an SSH session, which is not directly related to the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is also not directly related to the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection.
   - **C: T1216.001-PubPrn:** This technique involves using public printers for data exfiltration or command and control, which is not directly related to the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system, which logically precedes the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection. After gaining access through remote services, the attackers can then use writable mass storage devices to spread across the network.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
