Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a campaign that involves:
1. **Initial Access**: Malicious documents with macros are used to deliver payloads.
2. **Execution**: Payloads create files in the ProgramData directory and use a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script, which is obfuscated and contains backdoor functions.
3. **Persistence**: The VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation and use of publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
5. **Discovery**: The backdoor collects machine information and takes screenshots.
6. **Collection**: The backdoor sends collected data to a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that enables communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages after the backdoor has collected machine information and screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The backdoor function in the CTI outline is described as collecting machine information and taking screenshots, then sending this data to a C&C server. This indicates that the communication with the C&C server is a critical part of the attack.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. It does not directly relate to querying external services for communication.
- **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. It does not fit the context of querying external services.
- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a remote server. This aligns well with the scenario where the backdoor sends data to a C&C server.
- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It does not fit the context of querying external services for communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor function collects data and sends it to a C&C server.
- The communication with the C&C server is a form of querying an external service.
- The most plausible ATT&CK technique for this scenario is T1102-Web Service, as it involves using a web service to communicate with a remote server.

### Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
