Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Leveraging a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 to execute an Excel document.
2. **Execution**: Using a Visual Basic macro to execute a portable executable (PE32) named `vba_macro.exe`.
3. **Persistence**: Registering a binary to the startup shell to ensure `FONTCACHE.DAT` is executed upon system startup.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Using various anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering network information using `GetAdaptersInfo()` for lateral movement.
6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C2 server using HTTP.
7. **Exfiltration**: Sending gathered information to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware gathers network information using `GetAdaptersInfo()` to enable lateral movement to other systems within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK technique enables lateral movement after gathering network information.

- **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system. It does not directly relate to gathering network information.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application. It is not directly related to the gathered network information.
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a remote system. It could be relevant if the malware uses a remote service to move laterally.
- **T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**: This technique involves making and impersonating a token to gain elevated privileges. It is not directly related to the gathered network information.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the CTI outline, the malware gathers network information to identify potential targets for lateral movement. The most plausible ATT&CK technique that enables this lateral movement is **T1021-Remote Services**, as it involves using remote services to establish a foothold on other systems within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
