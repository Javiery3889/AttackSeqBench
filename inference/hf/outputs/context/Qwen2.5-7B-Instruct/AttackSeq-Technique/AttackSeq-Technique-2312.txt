Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Discovery:** The adversary used the `PsLogList` command to extract contents from the Windows Security Event Log.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access, the adversary moved laterally to a domain controller and continued to discover data of interest.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrated data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the adversary used discovery commands (like `PsLogList`) and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

3. **Comparing Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing data from a web portal, which is not directly related to the discovery of event logs or the exfiltration process.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System:** This technique involves accessing data from the local system, which could be relevant to the discovery phase but not specifically to the exfiltration phase.
   - **C: T1218.014-MMC:** This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to manage and manipulate system resources, which is not directly related to the discovery of event logs or the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the process of transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker's server. This fits the sequence as it occurs after the discovery phase and before the exfiltration using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the technique should occur after the discovery phase and before the exfiltration using a custom-built tool. The most plausible technique that fits this sequence is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as it involves the transfer of data over a C2 channel, which is a common method for data exfiltration in the context of the described attack.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
