Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The exploit used a race condition in Google Chrome (CVE-2019-13720) to achieve code execution.
   - **Persistence:** The malware installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware downloaded the next stage from a hardcoded C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred before the malware persisted by scheduling tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The persistence technique (T1566.003) involves scheduling tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler, which is mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - We need to identify the technique that would have occurred before this persistence step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The exploit (T1190) is used to gain initial access and execute code.
   - After the exploit, the malware would need to establish a foothold and ensure persistence.
   - The persistence technique (T1566.003) is the last step mentioned in the CTI outline for persistence.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the malware persisted by scheduling tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
   - The exploit (T1190) is the technique that would have occurred before the persistence step.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
