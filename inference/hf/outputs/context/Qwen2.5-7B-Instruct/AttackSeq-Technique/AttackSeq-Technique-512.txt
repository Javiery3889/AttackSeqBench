Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The Milum Trojan is described as using base64-encoded JSON data for configuration, which includes C2 URLs, timeouts, and RC4 keys. The Trojan transmits compressed JSON data in HTTP POST requests, encrypted with RC4.
   - **Persistence:** The Milum Trojan achieves persistence through HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after achieving persistence to transmit encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique is about gathering information about the victim organization, which is not directly related to the transmission of configuration data.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which is relevant to the HTTP POST requests used for communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of non-application layer protocols, which is not applicable here as the communication is via HTTP.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique is about executing malware at boot or logon, which is related to persistence but not to the transmission of configuration data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Milum Trojan transmits configuration data via HTTP POST requests, which is an application layer protocol.
   - The HTTP POST requests are used to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure, which is a key aspect of the malware's operation.
   - The use of HTTP POST requests is a clear example of an application layer protocol being used for communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
