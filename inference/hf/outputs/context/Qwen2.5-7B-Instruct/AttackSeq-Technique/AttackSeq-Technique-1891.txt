Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Use JSPRAT for command execution and file operations.
   - **Persistence:** Use various methods, including trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Utilize LSASS process memory dumping and Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use stealthy backdoors and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtain credentials through LSASS and network sniffing.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Use WMI and custom web shells.
   - **Collection:** Collect data from network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Use proxies and application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate data over web services.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that supports FIN13's efforts in targeting user accounts within victim networks after gathering information on network and host configurations and before employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery:** This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is more about network topology rather than user account targeting.
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves using PAM to gain access to user accounts, but it is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives, which is more about data collection rather than user account targeting.
   - **T1087-Account Discovery:** This technique involves identifying and enumerating user accounts and their associated information, which aligns with the question's requirement of targeting user accounts after gathering network information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The question specifies that the technique should be used after gathering information on network and host configurations and before employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
- T1087-Account Discovery fits this description as it involves identifying and enumerating user accounts, which is a crucial step in targeting user accounts within the network.

**Final Answer:**
Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery
