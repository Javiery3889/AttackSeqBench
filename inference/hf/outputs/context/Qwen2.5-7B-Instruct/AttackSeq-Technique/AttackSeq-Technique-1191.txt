Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing campaign using malicious MS Office documents.
2. **Execution**: Malicious macros and payloads are executed to download further malware, including the RMS tool.
3. **Persistence**: RMS executable is added to the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USERS' hive for persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Use of RMS for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
5. **Others**: Context about the threat actor group 'TA505' and their use of RMS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the RMS executable established communication with a C2 server located in Germany.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most relevant to the communication between the RMS executable and the C2 server.

- **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or programs by tricking users into loading or running the code. This does not fit the scenario of communication with a C2 server.
- **T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain name to evade detection. This could be a plausible technique for the C2 server communication.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control. This could also be relevant for C2 communication.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to establish command and control. This is a specific subset of T1071 and could be relevant if the C2 server uses web protocols.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Context of C2 Communication**: The question specifies that the RMS executable is establishing communication with a C2 server located in Germany. This communication is likely to be done using some form of application layer protocol.
2. **Fast Flux DNS**: While this technique can be used to evade detection, it is more about domain name changes rather than the actual communication protocol.
3. **Web Protocols**: This is a specific subset of application layer protocols and is a plausible technique for C2 communication, especially if the C2 server uses web protocols.
4. **Application Layer Protocol**: This is a broader term that encompasses various protocols, including web protocols, and is a more general technique that fits the scenario.

### Final Answer
Given the context and the need for a specific application layer protocol, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
