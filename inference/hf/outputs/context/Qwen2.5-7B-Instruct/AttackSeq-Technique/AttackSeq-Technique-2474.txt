Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: An email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment.
2. **Execution**: The executable file created a folder, extracted files, and ran various scripts and batch files.
3. **Persistence**: Modified the Windows registry to ensure a batch file ran at system start, used legitimate applications to collect credentials, and configured an application to run another batch file every hour.
4. **Credential Access**: Used legitimate applications to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers.
5. **Collection**: Collected credentials recurrently every hour.
6. **Command and Control**: Used FTP commands to upload stolen credentials.
7. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated stolen credentials to an FTP server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique involves the use of legitimate tools and scripts to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

- **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is not directly related to using legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves using legitimate credentials to masquerade as a legitimate user, which is more about impersonation rather than using tools to avoid detection.
- **T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the 'at' command to schedule tasks, which is a legitimate command but does not directly relate to the context of the question.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which is more about using legitimate accounts rather than using tools to avoid detection.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible technique that involves using legitimate tools and scripts to maintain persistence and avoid detection is **T1053.002-At**, as it involves using the 'at' command to schedule tasks, which can be used to run scripts and maintain persistence without triggering behavior-based detectors.

**Final Answer: C: T1053.002-At**
