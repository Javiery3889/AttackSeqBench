Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Execution:** The dropper is used to execute the NewPass implant.
   - **Persistence:** The NewPass malware creates a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The loader and agent use a JSON configuration in memory and a simple XOR algorithm to decode the initial configuration.
   - **Command and Control:** The NewPass agent communicates with a C2 server using a domain name and path, with encrypted HTTP requests.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the C2 server using stealthy POST requests and encryption.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel. While the NewPass agent does communicate with the C2 server, the question specifically mentions stealthy POST requests and encryption, which aligns more closely with data exfiltration.
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. The communication method (POST requests) and encryption are mentioned, which could fit, but it is more specific to the data exfiltration aspect.
   - **T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition:** This technique involves adding a library to a process to load and execute code. This does not align with the communication aspect mentioned in the question.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication. The question explicitly mentions encrypted HTTP requests, which aligns perfectly with this technique.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The NewPass agent communicates with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP requests, which is a form of encrypted channel.
- The question specifies stealthy POST requests and encryption, which directly aligns with the T1573-Encrypted Channel technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
