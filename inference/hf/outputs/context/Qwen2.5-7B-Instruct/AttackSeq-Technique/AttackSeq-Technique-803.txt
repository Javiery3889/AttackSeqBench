Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Higaisa APT group distributed malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
2. **Execution**: Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack involving several commands.
3. **Persistence**: The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' and copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The attack uses renamed 'certutil.exe' to bypass security detection.
5. **Discovery**: The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information using the command 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server after the JavaScript file created 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to establish a connection with a remote server. It is relevant for HTTPS communication.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run at a later time or date. It is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.
- **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves the use of an internal proxy to route traffic through a proxy server. It is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.
- **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering available internet connections. It is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The JavaScript file created 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information, which is part of the Discovery phase.
2. To enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server, the malware would need to establish a secure connection.
3. The most relevant ATT&CK technique for establishing a secure HTTPS connection is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
