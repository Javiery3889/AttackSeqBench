Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with subjects related to the current Ukrainian crisis, combined with the exploitation of MS Office documents.
   - **Exploitation:** CVE-2014-1761 was used to spread BlackEnergy.
   - **Malware:** BlackEnergy, which has been used for targeted attacks and is still active.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence:**
   - The attack sequence starts with initial access via spear-phishing emails and MS Office documents.
   - The exploitation technique used is CVE-2014-1761.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique that allows BlackEnergy to bypass standard detection methods after the initial access via MS Office documents and CVE-2014-1761.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol:** This technique involves using RDP to establish a remote session. It is not directly related to bypassing detection methods but rather to establishing a remote connection.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This aligns well with the need to bypass standard detection methods.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. While it can be used to evade detection, it is not directly related to the initial access via MS Office documents and CVE-2014-1761.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is related to the initial access but not to bypassing detection methods.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence starts with initial access via spear-phishing emails and MS Office documents.
   - The exploitation technique is CVE-2014-1761.
   - The question asks about a technique that allows BlackEnergy to bypass standard detection methods.
   - Among the given choices, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (B) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the need to bypass detection methods.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
