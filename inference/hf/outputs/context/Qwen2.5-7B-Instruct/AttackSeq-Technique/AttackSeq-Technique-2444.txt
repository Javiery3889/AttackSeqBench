Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** DRAGONFISH distributes Elise malware through a malicious Word document.
   - **Execution:** The malware injects `NavShExt.dll` into the `iexplore.exe` process and calls its export function.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique used to maintain persistence by modifying registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention modifying the registry to maintain persistence. However, the context of the question is about maintaining persistence, which is a common technique used by malware.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. It does not directly relate to maintaining persistence.
   - **T1218.004-InstallUtil:** This technique involves using the `InstallUtil` tool to install and configure software. It is not directly related to modifying the registry for persistence.
   - **T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures:** This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to maintain persistence. It is not related to the Windows registry.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to ensure that a program runs at boot or logon. This is a common method to maintain persistence.

Given the context of the question and the CTI outline, the most plausible technique for maintaining persistence by modifying registry keys is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
