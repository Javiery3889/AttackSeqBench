Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred during TG1021's lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network after using PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance and leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to resources. It does not fit the context of moving between IIS servers.
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is more related to the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a system. It could be relevant if the threat actor used a remote service to move laterally.
   - **T1021.007-Cloud Services:** This technique is similar to T1021 but specifically for cloud services, which is not relevant in this context.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the lateral movement occurred after reconnaissance and credential access. The most relevant technique for moving between IIS servers would be one that involves using a remote service to establish a foothold.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** is the most plausible technique as it aligns with the use of remote services to move laterally between IIS servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
