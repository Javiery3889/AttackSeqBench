Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - **Execution:** Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 in an Excel document (T1204 - User Execution)
   - **Credential Access:** Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214)
   - **Collection:** Data from Local System (T1005)
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C2 server (T1043 - Commonly Used Port, T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol)
   - **Exfiltration:** Data encrypted before exfiltration (T1002 - Data Encrypted)

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about a technique that removes forensic evidence after the execution exploit using CVE-2017-11882.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1204 - User Execution:** This technique describes the initial execution of the exploit. It does not pertain to removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1574.006 - Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load malicious code. It is not directly related to removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1548.003 - Sudo and Sudo Caching:** This technique involves using sudo to gain elevated privileges. It is not relevant to the context of removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1070 - Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This aligns with the question's requirement to remove forensic evidence.

Given the context of the attack and the need to remove forensic evidence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1070 - Indicator Removal.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
