### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers had intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant Resource Development capabilities, including adding domains for future use and developing malware.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise, specifically a compromised software update.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used various Execution techniques, including software deployment tools and system services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used several Defense Evasion techniques, including T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers were able to move through the network.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used Application Layer Protocol and Dynamic Resolution for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the threat actors evaded defenses using Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls, with the aim of gathering internal system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service. While it can be used for gathering information, it is more about taking control of a session rather than directly gathering information.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves identifying processes running on a system. It is a common method for gathering information about the system's state and can be used to identify valuable targets for further exploitation.
   - **C: T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) to gather user credentials and other sensitive information. It is a powerful method for gathering internal system information.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves identifying systems on a network. While it can be used to gather information, it is more about identifying targets rather than directly gathering internal system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for gathering internal system information after evading defenses is T1003.003-NTDS, as it directly involves accessing sensitive information from the Active Directory database.

**Final Answer: C: T1003.003-NTDS**
