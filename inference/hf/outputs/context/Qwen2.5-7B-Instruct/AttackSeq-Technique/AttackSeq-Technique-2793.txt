Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on iOS devices, specifically targeting iOS 7 and earlier versions.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs in the background, collects various types of data, and is designed to hide its icon and restart automatically.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects sensitive information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique used to send the collected information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any technique for exfiltrating data. However, it does indicate that the malware collects sensitive information and likely transmits it.
   - The question is specifically asking about a technique for encoding and exfiltrating data.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery** - This technique is about discovering the system's location, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to obfuscate the data. Base64 encoding is a common method of data encoding.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting** - This technique is used to hide the true destination of network traffic, which is not directly related to encoding data.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** - This technique involves compromising software to gain an advantage, which is not related to encoding or exfiltrating data.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware collects sensitive information and likely transmits it.
   - The question specifies that the data is sent via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix, which aligns with the T1132-Data Encoding technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding**
