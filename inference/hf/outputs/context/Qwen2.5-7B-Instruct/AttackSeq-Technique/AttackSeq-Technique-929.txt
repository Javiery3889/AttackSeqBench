Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers target publicly facing web servers and use both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
- **Execution**: The Explosive Trojan is described with its main executable and DLL components.
- **Persistence**: Explosive can be installed in various paths and uses keylogging and other methods to persist.
- **Defense Evasion**: The Trojan avoids detection and hides from common tools.
- **Credential Access**: Keylogging is used to gain access to administrator passwords.
- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers use initially infected servers as pivots and can spread via USB infection.
- **Command and Control**: A multi-tiered server backend framework is used for control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred before the group used compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks. The answer choices are:
- A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
- B: T1595-Active Scanning
- C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories
- D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning networks to identify potential targets. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers use both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery, which aligns with active scanning.
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves using data from information repositories, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**: This technique involves using wordlists to guess credentials, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline states that the attackers initially target publicly facing web servers and use both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
- This process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers aligns with the T1595-Active Scanning technique, which involves scanning networks to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.

### Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning
