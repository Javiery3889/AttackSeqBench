To determine the correct answer, let's break down the attack sequence from the CTI outline and match it with the provided answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Weaponized DOCX documents using the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server. The RTF files used in the attack were weaponized using RoyalRoad, exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain a foothold.
4. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters.
5. **Collection**: The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with a C&C server using a specific protocol.
7. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection during the infection chain, and before gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Anti-Analysis and Anti-Debugging Techniques**: These techniques are typically used to evade detection and analysis by security tools. This is likely to occur during the execution phase, where the attackers use vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install the backdoor.
- **Gathering Detailed Information**: This is part of the Discovery phase, where the backdoor collects various details about the victim's system.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating information or files. While it could be part of the execution phase, it is not directly related to anti-analysis and anti-debugging.
- **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default accounts, which is not relevant to the context of the question.
- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communication, which is part of the Command and Control phase, not the execution phase.
- **D: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code during system initialization. This is a common method to evade detection and is part of the execution phase, making it a plausible candidate for the anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of AppInit DLLs to load malicious code during system initialization, which would help evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
