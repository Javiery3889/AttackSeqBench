Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Deployed Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
2. **Execution**: Deployed Trochilus malware with encrypted C2 communications.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Utilized DLL sideloading to execute a legitimate binary and load a renamed malicious DLL.
5. **Credential Access**: Used Mimikatz for credential theft and accessed the NTDS.DIT database.
6. **Lateral Movement**: Logged in to the network via Citrix servers.
7. **Command and Control**: Used encrypted C2 communications with Trochilus.
8. **Exfiltration**: Employed custom malware to compress and upload files to Dropbox using cURL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT10 exfiltrated compressed proprietary data to Dropbox using the cURL command-line tool. The relevant TTP here is **Exfiltration** (T1041).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the TTP that logically precedes the exfiltration of data. The exfiltration process involves compressing and uploading files, which implies that the data must first be collected and possibly compressed.

- **T1213.003-Code Repositories**: This technique involves using code repositories to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the exfiltration process described.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It is more related to initial access and credential access, not directly to exfiltration.
- **T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities. It is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data before exfiltration. This is a plausible step before exfiltration, as it involves compressing and preparing the data for upload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The exfiltration process described involves compressing and uploading files using cURL.
- The data must be collected and possibly compressed before it can be exfiltrated.
- Among the given options, **T1560-Archive Collected Data** is the most plausible technique that directly precedes the exfiltration process.

### Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data
