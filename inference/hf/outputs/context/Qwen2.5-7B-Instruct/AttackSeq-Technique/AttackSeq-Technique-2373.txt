Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is introduced via removable media.
2. **Execution**: The malware (netsat.exe) infects removable media and collects data.
3. **Discovery**: The malware collects detailed system information.
4. **Collection**: The malware collects data in the form of files.
5. **Command and Control**: Commands are received from an encrypted file on the local system.
6. **Exfiltration**: The means of exfiltration is not determined, but it is implied that data might be collected by the 'master' system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that would clean up traces of the malware system and avoid detection after the execution and data collection phases.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify a technique that would help in cleaning up traces and avoiding detection. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**
  - This technique involves modifying or deleting command history logs to avoid detection. While it could be used to clean up traces, it is more specific to command history and not directly related to the malware's cleanup process.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise (IoCs) to avoid detection. This could include deleting logs, registry entries, or other artifacts that might indicate the presence of the malware. This aligns well with the need to clean up traces and avoid detection.

- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering system information, which is already described in the CTI outline. It does not fit the context of cleaning up traces and avoiding detection.

- **D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
  - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain elevated privileges or maintain persistence. It is not directly related to cleaning up traces and avoiding detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the malware's behavior and the need to clean up traces and avoid detection.
- The most relevant technique for cleaning up traces and avoiding detection is T1070-Indicator Removal, as it directly addresses the removal of indicators of compromise.

### Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal
