Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) and Seaduke to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Seaduke is used to hide and exfiltrate sensitive information.
   - **Credential Access:** The group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from MS Exchange Server.
   - **Collection:** Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information, updates configuration, uploads/download files, and has a self-delete function.
   - **Command and Control:** Seaduke communicates with C&C servers over HTTP/HTTPS with layers of encoding and encryption.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used when the Duke group archived and transmitted sensitive information using legitimate cloud services after communicating with their C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves using protocols other than the ones typically used for exfiltration. However, the question specifies the use of legitimate cloud services, which implies a more standard protocol.
   - **T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves accessing data from a configuration repository, which is not directly related to exfiltration or cloud services.
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves using web services for exfiltration, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services and HTTP/HTTPS channels.
   - **T1585.003-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using cloud accounts for exfiltration, which is a plausible method but does not directly specify the use of web services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service, as it directly aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services and web services for exfiltration.

Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
