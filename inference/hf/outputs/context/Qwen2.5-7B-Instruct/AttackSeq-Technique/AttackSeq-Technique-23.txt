Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to capture sensitive information from the clipboard after achieving persistence by creating a task named 'Microsoft_up' and creating 'Java Update.lnk'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any technique for capturing clipboard data. However, we need to infer which technique is most likely used based on the context.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. While it is related to initial access, it does not directly capture clipboard data.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. It is not directly related to clipboard data capture.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. It is not related to clipboard data capture.
   - **T1115-Clipboard Data:** This technique involves capturing data from the clipboard, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

Given the context of the question and the available options, the most plausible technique for capturing sensitive information from the clipboard is T1115-Clipboard Data.

**Final Answer: D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
