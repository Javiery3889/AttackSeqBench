Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The backdoors (BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) are installed as services and are capable of various malicious functions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoors use a loader DLL (AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll) and an encrypted backdoor (Msadoz<n>.dll) with an encrypted configuration file (Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui). The loader DLL loads the encrypted backdoor, and the configuration file contains C&C information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to establish secure communication with C2 servers after deploying backdoors and obfuscating their presence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control (C2) communication. However, the CTI outline does not mention multiple channels.
   - **T1548.006-TCC Manipulation:** This technique involves manipulating the Task Scheduler to establish persistence. The CTI outline does not mention the Task Scheduler.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. The CTI outline mentions that the backdoors are sophisticated and use encrypted configuration files, which aligns with this technique.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection. The CTI outline does not mention injecting code into a process to establish secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes the use of encrypted configuration files to maintain C2 communication. This aligns with the use of encrypted channels to avoid detection.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant ATT&CK technique as it directly addresses the use of encrypted channels for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
