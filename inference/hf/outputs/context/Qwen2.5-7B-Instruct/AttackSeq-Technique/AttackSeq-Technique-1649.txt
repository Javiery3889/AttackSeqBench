Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** PowerShell commands downloaded malicious payloads from compromised servers.
   - **Execution:** PowerShell commands initiated the download of a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems and used PowerSploit and Tater modules.
   - **Persistence:** MSI package ensured persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used an MSI package to remove registry keys of old PurpleFox installations, installed a rootkit driver, and created a Windows firewall rule to block incoming connections on specific ports.
   - **Others:** The backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel between the infected client and the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers after the described defense evasion tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the C&C server. However, the CTI outline mentions WebSocket communication, not a web service.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves signaling to establish a covert communication channel. While it could be relevant, it is not specifically mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels:** This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked. The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor utilized WebSocket communication, which is a fallback channel in this context.
   - **T1014-Rootkit:** This technique involves using a rootkit to hide files, registry keys, and processes. While the rootkit was used for defense evasion, it does not directly establish a bidirectional communication channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that the backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel between the infected client and the server.
   - WebSocket communication is a fallback channel that can be used to establish a covert communication channel when the primary channel is blocked or detected.
   - T1008-Fallback Channels is the most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with the described bidirectional communication channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
