Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack was delivered through a Microsoft Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
- **Execution**: The .hta file was executed by mshta.exe, and the warning message was disabled by sending an 'Enter' command.
- **Defense Evasion**: The Helminth Trojan used various evasive mechanisms, including regenerating its signatures and using a sophisticated version of Mimikatz.
- **Credential Access**: A customized Mimikatz bat script was used to gather information.
- **Command and Control**: The DnE1.Ps1 file communicated with a C&C server using DNS exchange queries.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique used to maintain the Helminth Trojan agent's presence by automatically executing files at regular intervals after the initial execution via mshta.exe.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique involves clearing event logs to avoid detection. It does not fit the context of maintaining the Trojan's presence by executing files.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a script or executable at regular intervals. This aligns with the context of maintaining the Trojan's presence.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. While it is related to C2, it does not fit the context of maintaining the Trojan's presence by executing files.
- **T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing file associations to execute a specific program when a file is opened. It does not fit the context of maintaining the Trojan's presence by executing files at regular intervals.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the attack utilized a sophisticated version of Mimikatz to gather information and includes commands to handle non-ASCII characters and validate the scheduled task added by the persistence mechanism.
- The question specifically asks about maintaining the Trojan's presence by automatically executing files at regular intervals.
- Among the given options, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is the most relevant technique for maintaining the Trojan's presence by creating a scheduled task to run a script or executable at regular intervals.

### Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
