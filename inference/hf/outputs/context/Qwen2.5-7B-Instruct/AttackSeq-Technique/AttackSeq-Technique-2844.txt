Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack sequence:
1. **Initial Access**: A dropper malware written in Delphi is used to download a second stage payload.
2. **Execution**: The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is downloaded and executed.
3. **Persistence**: The 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The dropper is submitted to Virus Total, and the malware uses HTTPS for communication.
5. **Discovery**: The malware sends system information to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for communication with the C2 server leveraging HTTPS with a POST method after the malware sent system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data. It does not fit the context of HTTPS communication.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. HTTPS is an application layer protocol, so this fits the context.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malware. It does not fit the context of HTTPS communication.
- **T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**: This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state. It does not fit the context of HTTPS communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware sends system information to the C2 server using HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol.
- The question specifies that the communication leverages HTTPS with a POST method, which is a common way to send data over HTTPS.
- The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this scenario is T1071, which involves using application layer protocols for command and control.

### Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
