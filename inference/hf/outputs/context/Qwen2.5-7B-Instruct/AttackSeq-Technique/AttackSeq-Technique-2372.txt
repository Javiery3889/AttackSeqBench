Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware infects removable media and collects data.
- **Execution**: The malware operates as a master program, infecting removable media and collecting data. It receives commands from an encrypted file on the local system.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware cleans up after itself and employs date sensitivity.
- **Discovery**: The malware collects detailed information from systems.
- **Collection**: The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated.
- **Exfiltration**: The means of exfiltration are not determined, but data is collected by the 'master' system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the secure delivery of commands for the malware's operations after it collects detailed system and drive information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to establish persistence or access. It does not align with the secure delivery of commands from an encrypted file.
- **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using network traffic patterns to communicate with the C2 server. It does not fit the context of an encrypted file on the local system.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of the malware's presence. It does not pertain to the secure delivery of commands.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server. The malware receives commands from an encrypted file on the local system, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware receives commands from an encrypted file on the local system, indicating a secure communication channel.
- The encrypted file on the local system is a form of encrypted channel, which is a method to securely deliver commands.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitated the secure delivery of commands for the malware's operations.

### Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
