Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The Welcome Chat app is used to gain initial access to the device.
- **Discovery**: The app collects device information, including GPS location.
- **Collection**: The app exfiltrates various types of data.
- **Command and Control**: The app sends collected data to a C&C server and is ready to receive commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensures the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts. This implies a technique that ensures persistence on the device.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**: This technique involves using a web-based method to bypass security controls. It does not directly relate to ensuring the app starts automatically.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malware or malicious software is executed when the system boots up or when a user logs on. This aligns with the requirement to ensure the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
- **T1546.014-Emond**: This technique involves using a specific file or registry entry to ensure that malware is executed at boot time. It is a specific method under T1546, which is about persistence.
- **T1125-Video Capture**: This technique involves capturing video from a device's camera. It does not relate to ensuring the app starts automatically.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the Welcome Chat app's behavior, including its persistence and functionality.
- The question specifically asks about ensuring the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the requirement of ensuring the app starts automatically at boot time or logon.

### Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
