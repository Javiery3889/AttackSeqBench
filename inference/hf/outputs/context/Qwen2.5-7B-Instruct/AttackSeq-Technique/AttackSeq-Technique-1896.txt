To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the CTI outline and the question step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
- **Execution**: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution and file operations.
- **Persistence**: FIN13 uses various methods, including replacing legitimate binaries and deploying malware.
- **Privilege Escalation**: FIN13 uses common techniques like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
- **Defense Evasion**: FIN13 uses passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for stealth.
- **Credential Access**: FIN13 uses LSASS process memory dumping and network sniffing.
- **Discovery**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for reconnaissance.
- **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: FIN13 uses proxies and application layer protocols for C2.
- **Exfiltration**: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 employed tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement. This implies that the technique in question should be related to the actions taken after moving laterally within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email data locally. It is not directly related to the lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data that has been collected. It is a plausible candidate as it follows the lateral movement and could be used to prepare data for exfiltration.
- **T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves compromising email accounts. It is not directly related to the lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection during exfiltration. It is a plausible candidate as it follows the lateral movement and could be used to prepare data for exfiltration.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 uses Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
2. **Data Collection**: After moving laterally, the group would likely collect data from network shared drives.
3. **Data Preparation**: To prepare the data for exfiltration, the group would likely encode the data to avoid detection.
4. **Data Exfiltration**: The encoded data would then be exfiltrated over web services.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after FIN13 employed tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement, they would likely use T1132-Data Encoding to prepare the data for exfiltration.

Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding
