Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used watering hole tactics and injected exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - **Execution:** The Chrome exploit vector involved chaining two patched vulnerabilities to execute custom shellcode. This shellcode de-obfuscated strings, initialized a network connection, and downloaded 'dropper.dll' from a C&C server.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware implemented checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect information.
   - **Command and Control:** The SLUB malware communicated with a Mattermost server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The SLUB malware exfiltrated system information and captured screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after executing shellcode through chained exploits to download and run 'dropper.dll,' and before implementing checks for security software to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The sequence of events described in the CTI outline is:
     1. Execution of shellcode through chained exploits.
     2. Download and run 'dropper.dll.'
     3. Implementation of checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - The question is asking about the technique that would allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges before the security software checks.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is not directly related to gaining system privileges.
   - **B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher-level access, which aligns with the need to execute malware with system privileges.
   - **C: T1546.016-Installer Packages** - This technique involves using installer packages to deploy malware, which is not directly related to gaining system privileges.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services** - This technique involves using cloud services for command and control, which is not directly related to gaining system privileges.

Given the context of the question and the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that would allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges is **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: B**
