Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** GreyEnergy targets energy companies and high-value organizations in Ukraine and Poland.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules.
   - **Initial Access:** GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers.
   - **Persistence:** Malware components are securely wiped from the victims' hard drives.
   - **Credential Access:** Use of Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Deployment of internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to an external C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Internal C&C proxies are used for stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions "modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption and fileless execution techniques."
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique occurred before GreyEnergy operators used only selected modules on specific targets for increased stealth.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a service to establish a foothold. It does not directly relate to the use of modular malware or fileless execution.
   - **T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling:** This technique involves using LNK files to spread malware. It is not directly related to modular malware or fileless execution.
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols to establish a foothold. It is not directly related to modular malware or fileless execution.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding artifacts to maintain persistence and avoid detection. It aligns with the use of modular malware and fileless execution to increase stealth.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions "modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption and fileless execution techniques." These are advanced techniques used to maintain stealth and persistence.
   - The CTI outline mentions that GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework and that the operators use techniques to cover their tracks and maintain stealth.
   - The technique that best fits the description of hiding artifacts to maintain stealth and avoid detection is T1564-Hide Artifacts.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
