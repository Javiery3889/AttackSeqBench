Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, which allows it to use proxy settings and includes a checksum in the HTTP Cookie header.
   - **Command and Control:** ZoxPNG communicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests, with the first GET request establishing initial contact. Subsequent requests may use GET or POST, and the C2 server responds with a PNG file containing the next instruction. The malware is resilient to network instability, retrying connections multiple times with delays.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurs when ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch after establishing communication with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions, which is relevant to the use of the WinInet API for HTTP communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which is relevant to the use of HTTP for communication.
   - **T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow:** This technique is not relevant to the context of the question, as it pertains to Unix/Linux systems and not the Windows environment described.
   - **T1106-Native API:** This is the same as the first option, but it is listed again, which might be a repetition or a typo.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, which is a native API.
   - The question asks about the technique when ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch, which is a part of the malware's operation.
   - The use of the WinInet API for HTTP communication is a key aspect of the malware's operation, and this aligns with the T1106-Native API technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API**
