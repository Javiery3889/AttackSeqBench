Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key points:
- **Exfiltration**: SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after SideCopy used njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. While it is related to the Kavach MFA app, it does not directly describe the exfiltration of authentication databases.
- **T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other documents. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of authentication databases.
- **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or form submissions. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of authentication databases.
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. The CTI outline explicitly mentions that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices, which aligns perfectly with this technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.
- Among the given options, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the only technique that directly describes the automated transfer of data, which matches the exfiltration activity described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
