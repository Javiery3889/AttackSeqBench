Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails were sent to various targets, exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
- **Command and Control**: Various backdoors (RIPTIDE, HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, WATERSPOUT) were used to establish communication with C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoors established communication with their respective C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The spear phishing emails are the initial entry point.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoors are used to maintain communication with the C2 servers.

We need to identify a technique that would occur between the initial access (spear phishing) and the command and control phase (backdoor communication).

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an SSH session. It is not directly related to the initial access or the backdoor communication.
- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It could be relevant but is more about data exfiltration or persistence rather than the initial setup.
- **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. It could be used to hide the backdoor process but is not directly related to the initial access phase.
- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It could be used to hide the backdoor or other malicious activities, but it is more about maintaining stealth rather than the initial setup.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- The spear phishing emails (Initial Access) are the first step.
- The backdoors (Command and Control) are the next step.
- To ensure the backdoors are not detected, APT12 would likely use techniques to hide them, which aligns with the T1564-Hide Artifacts technique.

### Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
