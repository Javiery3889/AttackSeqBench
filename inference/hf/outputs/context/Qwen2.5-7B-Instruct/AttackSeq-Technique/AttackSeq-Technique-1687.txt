Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Sending malicious emails with attachments that install the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.
2. **Execution**: The backdoor Trojan installs and contacts a C&C server.
3. **Credential Access**: Dumping Windows cached password hashes.
4. **Lateral Movement**: Using the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network.
5. **Collection**: Copying intellectual property to internal staging servers.
6. **Exfiltration**: Uploading the collected data to a remote site.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred when the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan established communications with a C&C server after performing lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to gain elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to the communication with a C&C server.
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data. It is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. This could be relevant to the communication with a C&C server.
- **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication material, such as stolen credentials, to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the communication with a C&C server.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan, upon installation, contacts a C&C server using an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80. The question asks about the technique used for this communication. The most plausible technique that aligns with this scenario is **T1571-Non-Standard Port**, as it involves using non-standard ports to evade detection. Although the outline mentions TCP port 80, which is a standard port, the technique of using non-standard ports is a common evasion technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
