Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The attackers installed the 'Mipko' monitoring tool on the processor's network.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The attackers gained full access to the bank network and compromised the Enterprise Admin account.
3. **Defense Evasion**: They used legitimate tools and commands for lateral movement and maintained backdoor connections.
4. **Credential Access**: They identified and used bank employee credentials.
5. **Lateral Movement**: They compromised the third-party processor's network.
6. **Command and Control**: They coordinated ATM withdrawals.
7. **Impact**: They manipulated the bank's internal systems and removed anti-fraud controls.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that facilitated unauthorized access to the bank's systems before installing the 'Mipko' monitoring tool. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
- Recruiting mules to create fraudulent accounts
- Gaining unauthorized access to the bank's systems

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to systems. It is not directly related to gaining unauthorized access.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. It fits the context of using bank employee credentials.
- **T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to gaining unauthorized access.
- **T1543.005-Container Service**: This technique involves using container services. It is not directly related to gaining unauthorized access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the attackers used valid bank employee credentials to gain access to the system.
- The question asks about the technique that facilitated unauthorized access, which aligns with the use of valid accounts (T1078).
- The other techniques do not fit the context of gaining unauthorized access.

**Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
