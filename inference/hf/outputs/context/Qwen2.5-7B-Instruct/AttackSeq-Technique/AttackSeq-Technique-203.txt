Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the cyberespionage group FamousSparrow. Here is the sequence of TTPs as described:

1. **Resource Development**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creating registry Run key entries and installing as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not specified in the report.
6. **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
7. **Discovery**: Collecting system information.
8. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the group injected the encrypted shellcode `MpSvc.dll` into processes but before they used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system. While it is a relevant technique, it does not directly follow the injection of shellcode.
- **T1612-Build Image on Host**: This technique involves building an image on the host, which is not directly related to the injection of shellcode or credential dumping.
- **T1135-Network Share Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the injection of shellcode or credential dumping.
- **T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is directly related to the injection of the encrypted shellcode `MpSvc.dll`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the technique in question occurred after the injection of the encrypted shellcode `MpSvc.dll` into processes.
- The only technique that fits this description is T1055-Process Injection, as it directly relates to the injection of code into processes.

### Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection
