Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware was downloaded via a compromised website (knf.gov[.]pl) that altered its code to download malicious JavaScript files.
- **Execution**: The malware (gpsvc.exe) is a Win32 executable packed with 'Enigma Protector' and drops a known Lazarus group malware variant.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' and executes system information gathering commands.
- **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with C&C servers (125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218) using a beacon with a Firefox-like User-Agent.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware gathered detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections after using 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. The CTI outline does not mention any exploitation of a public-facing application.
- **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about network connections, which aligns with the malware's behavior of gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections.
- **T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This technique involves discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves adding entries to the XDG autostart directory to ensure persistence. The CTI outline does not mention any persistence mechanisms related to XDG autostart entries.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware gathers detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections.
- The ATT&CK technique that best matches this behavior is T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, as it directly pertains to gathering information about network connections.

### Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
