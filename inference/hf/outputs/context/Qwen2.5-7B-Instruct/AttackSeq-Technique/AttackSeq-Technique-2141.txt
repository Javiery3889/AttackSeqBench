Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware was delivered via a malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.
   - **Additional Context:** The malware transferred to 13 other C2 domains, and the use of NameCheap infrastructure has been previously observed in AridViper's activities.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains after the initial POST request to judystevenson[.]info.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data or transfer tools. However, the context does not suggest data exfiltration or the use of mail protocols.
   - **T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication:** This technique involves using domain controller authentication to gain access to network resources. This does not align with the context of transferring tools or payloads to C2 domains.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a target network. Given that the malware transferred to 13 other C2 domains, this technique fits the context well.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While phishing was used for initial access, the question is about the transfer of additional tools or payloads to C2 domains, which is not directly related to phishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware was initially delivered via a phishing campaign.
   - After the initial POST request to the C2 domain, the malware transferred to 13 other C2 domains.
   - The transfer of tools or payloads to these C2 domains is best described by the ATT&CK technique T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
