Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing email campaign with shortened URLs delivering Zebrocy components.
   - **Execution:** Control of the backdoor, sending commands, and downloading new components.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking for registry-based persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Deleting files and killing processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:** Using dumpers to retrieve credentials from browsers and email clients.
   - **Discovery:** Gathering system and network information.
   - **Collection:** Scanning for files, staging data, and creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C server using ports 80 or 443.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware communicated with the C&C server over ports 80 or 443.
   - The Collection phase is mentioned, which includes scanning for files and creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique is about launching a process or service to maintain persistence, which does not fit the context of exfiltration.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of files.
   - **T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a cloud storage service, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data to an external location, which aligns with the CTI outline's description of the malware scanning for files and creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate.

Given the context of the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the automated exfiltration of data.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
