Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious macros or links to OneDrive.
   - **Defense Evasion:** GHOLE malware uses hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the GHOLE malware used hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The key detail here is the use of hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests for C&C communication. This is a method of evading network defenses and maintaining persistence.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. It does not match the context of hard-coded IP addresses.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It is not directly related to hard-coded IP addresses.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access. It does not match the context of C&C communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. While it is related to network communication, it does not specifically address the use of hard-coded IP addresses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication, which aligns with the technique of using application layer protocols to maintain access and communication.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
