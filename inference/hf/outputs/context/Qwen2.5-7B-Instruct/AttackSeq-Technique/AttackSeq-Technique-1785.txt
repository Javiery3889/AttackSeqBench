Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The key TTPs and their sequence from the CTI outline are:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
2. **Execution**: Fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads from offensive frameworks like Cobalt Strike, PowerSploit, and Nishang.
3. **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks to download secondary payloads, mainly Cobalt Strike Beacon.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Mimikatz for credential dumping.
5. **Defense Evasion**: DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
6. **Credential Access**: Harvesting credentials using Mimikatz.
7. **Lateral Movement**: Expanding control within the network using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
8. **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and DNS Tunneling for C2 communication.
9. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that facilitated the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure after executing PowerShell scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it is relevant, it does not specifically address the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **T1137.003-Outlook Forms**: This technique involves using Microsoft Outlook forms to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves creating files or registry entries that are executed when a system boots or a user logs on. This could be relevant for persistence, but it does not directly address the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.
- **T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**: This technique involves modifying file properties to make a malicious file appear as a legitimate file. This is more about evading detection and does not directly address the continuous operation of a fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible TTP that facilitated the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**. This technique ensures that the payload is executed every time the system boots or a user logs on, which is crucial for maintaining a persistent and continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
