Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The outline describes the Gamaredon group's attack sequence, including their use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2).
   - The relevant part for the question is: "Command and Control: The group's malware uses both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control."

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits
     - B: T1137.006-Add-ins
     - C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
     - D: T1106-Native API

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits:** This technique is about limiting the size of data transferred, which is not directly related to uploading harvested documents.
   - **T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves using add-ins to perform malicious actions, which is not relevant to the data transfer process.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario of uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **T1106-Native API:** This technique involves using native APIs to perform malicious actions, which is not directly related to the data transfer process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as it directly relates to uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.

Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
