Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** BitterAPT used compromised websites like gandharaart[.]org to distribute their malware.
   - **Persistence and Lateral Movement:** The malware, BitterRAT, has the capability to communicate with multiple CnC servers such as blitzchatlog.ddns.net and playupdateapp.serveblog.net.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers.
   - The CnC servers mentioned are blitzchatlog.ddns.net and playupdateapp.serveblog.net.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data or control malware. It does not directly relate to CnC server communication.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to IP addresses, which is crucial for malware to communicate with CnC servers. This aligns with the need for the malware to connect to multiple CnC servers.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the communication with CnC servers.

Given the context of the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitates communication with multiple CnC servers is T1568-Dynamic Resolution.

**Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
