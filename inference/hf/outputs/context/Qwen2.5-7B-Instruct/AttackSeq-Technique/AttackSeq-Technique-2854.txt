Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious shortcut files are used to deliver Asruex malware.
   - **Execution:** PowerShell commands are executed to download a batch file, which then downloads a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.
   - **Command and Control:** The downloader retrieves and decodes Asruex malware, which communicates with a C&C server and executes commands based on configuration information.
   - **Others:** Additional details about Asruex, including its functions and the use of a plug-in (AdvProv.dll).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that follows the execution of PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable and a decoy document, and that is used to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1584.003-Virtual Private Server:** This technique is not directly related to hindering analysis or detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection, but it does not specifically mention hindering analysis by detecting virtual machines or anti-virus software.
   - **T1134-Access Token Manipulation:** This technique involves modifying access tokens to gain elevated privileges, which is not directly related to hindering analysis or detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves actions to impair or disable security tools, including virtual machines and anti-virus software, which aligns with the question's requirement.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows the execution of PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable and a decoy document, and that is used to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software, is T1562-Impair Defenses.

Final Answer: D: T1562-Impair Defenses
