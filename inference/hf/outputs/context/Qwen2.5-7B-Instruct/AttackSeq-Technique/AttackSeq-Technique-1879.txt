Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials.
- **Execution**: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before FIN13 executed commands locally using JSPRAT.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the immediate execution of commands using JSPRAT.
- **T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves using a network provider DLL to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the execution of commands using JSPRAT.
- **T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access. It is not directly related to the execution of commands using JSPRAT.
- **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network. This aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase where FIN13 maps the victim networks and captures credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that FIN13 conducts reconnaissance by mapping victim networks and capturing credentials.
- The execution phase involves using JSPRAT for local command execution.
- The technique that most likely occurred before the execution of commands using JSPRAT is the gathering of victim network information, which is directly related to the reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
