Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** PIVY uses DLL sideloading to drop a decoy document and a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll.
   - **Execution:** PIVY copies `rundll32.exe` to `ActiveFlash.exe` and executes it with the path to the DLL.
   - **Persistence:** PIVY installs itself for automatic startup via a `.lnk` in the Windows Startup folder.
   - **Command and Control:** PIVY communicates with C2 servers using modified hostnames with null-byte padding.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after PIVY established persistence via the `.lnk` in the Windows Startup folder, to evade detection while using DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1200-Hardware Additions:** This technique involves adding hardware to a system to evade detection. It does not align with the context of DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.
   - **T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting:** This technique involves manipulating security alerts to evade detection. While it could be relevant, it does not directly address the use of DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to evade detection. It aligns well with the context of DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration to evade detection.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the context of DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration to evade detection.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves hiding artifacts to evade detection while using DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
