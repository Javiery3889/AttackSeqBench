Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the installer 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe, which places spyware components and launches sysCrt32.exe.
2. **Execution**: sysCrt32.exe ensures persistence and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours. It also executes batch files and other executables for keylogging, clipboard logging, and Chrome password extraction.
3. **Persistence**: The spyware adds the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe.
4. **Credential Access**: libchrome.exe logs usernames and passwords from Google Chrome's SQLite databases.
5. **Collection**: sysOptimizer.bat collects and archives personal files, and libCache32.exe and libTemp32.exe perform keylogging and clipboard content logging.
6. **Command and Control**: The C2 servers are hosted on Novinhost, and the malware uses curl.exe to access FTP servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer collected data securely to the FTP servers after sysOptimizer.bat collects personal files and sysCrt32.exe initializes execution components.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automated data exfiltration, which fits the scenario where the malware transfers collected data to FTP servers.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks, which is more related to persistence and not directly to data exfiltration.
- **T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to data exfiltration.
- **T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not specifically FTP servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware uses curl.exe to access FTP servers, which is a method of exfiltrating data.
- The question specifically asks about the technique used to transfer collected data to FTP servers.
- T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the automated transfer of data to an external server, which in this case is an FTP server.

### Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
