Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with LNK files leading to cmd.exe.
   - **Execution:** Multi-stage PowerShell-based implant called Powersing.
     - Stage 0: Extracts and executes the next element and a decoy document.
     - Stage 1: PowerShell script with a C# assembly to connect to a dead drop resolver and obtain cryptographic material.
     - Stage 2: Actual malware implant that connects to the dead drop resolver for C&C server address.
   - **Persistence:** Creates a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to a VBE startup script.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Evasion techniques include detecting virtualization and malware analysis tools.
   - **Collection:** Captures screenshots and executes arbitrary PowerShell scripts.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about a communication technique with the C&C server involving JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Powersing connects to a dead drop resolver to obtain cryptographic material and C&C server address. This indicates that the communication involves a dead drop resolver.
   - The question specifies that the communication involves JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers. This aligns with the use of public services for communication, which is a common technique in T1568.

4. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique is related to capturing screenshots, which is mentioned in the CTI outline but not the communication aspect.
   - **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation** - This technique involves DNS calculations, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using web services for communication, which could be a plausible method but does not specifically mention JSON-encoded objects.
   - **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** - This technique involves using public services as dead drop resolvers, which aligns with the CTI outline's mention of dead drop resolvers and the question's requirement for JSON-encoded objects.

**Final Answer: D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
