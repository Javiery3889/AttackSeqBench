Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** MuddyWater used malicious documents and a PowerShell-based backdoor named POWERSTATS.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used open-source tools like Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, and Invoke-Obfuscation. They also used GitHub for hosting their backdoor and compiled it as an executable using PS2EXE.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that facilitates communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs after the use of Meterpreter and Mimikatz for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves the use of traffic patterns to communicate with the C2 server. It does not specifically mention domains or proxy URLs.
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves hiding files to evade detection. It does not pertain to communication methods.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with the C2 server. It could potentially involve domains and proxy URLs.
   - **T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt:** This technique involves obtaining elevated privileges or a user prompt to execute code. It does not pertain to communication methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the technique facilitates communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.
   - Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant as it involves using application layer protocols, which can include domains and proxy URLs for communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
