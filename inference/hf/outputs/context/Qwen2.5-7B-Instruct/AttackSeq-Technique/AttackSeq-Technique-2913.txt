Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Execution:** Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
   - **Persistence:** RoyalDNS installs itself persistently.
   - **Defense Evasion:** RoyalCLI evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution.
   - **Credential Access:** APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Collection:** Used various tools to extract data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after APT15 evaded policy settings that disable command prompt execution using the RoyalCLI backdoor, they needed a technique to obtain domain administrator credentials for further actions within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - The question is asking which ATT&CK technique facilitated obtaining these credentials.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates** - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not directly related to obtaining domain administrator credentials.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. Mimikatz is a tool that can extract credentials, which aligns with this technique.
   - **C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption** - This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to obtaining domain administrator credentials.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers** - This technique involves using systemd timers, which is not related to obtaining domain administrator credentials.

**Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
