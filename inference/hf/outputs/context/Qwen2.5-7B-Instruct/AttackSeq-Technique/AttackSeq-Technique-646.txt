Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with executable files or password-protected documents.
- **Execution**: Use of evasion techniques, including 'CPU core check' to detect virtualized environments.
- **Defense Evasion**: Techniques to evade detection by sandbox environments, antivirus software, and gateway firewalls.
- **Command and Control**: Use of network beacons and plugin functionality for additional payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that ensures the implanted RAT can execute upon system startup after bypassing environment-based checks.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic. It is not directly related to ensuring execution upon system startup.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves placing malware in locations where it will be executed when the system boots up or when a user logs on. This aligns with the question's requirement of ensuring the RAT executes upon system startup.
- **T1608-Stage Capabilities**: This technique involves the malware staging additional capabilities, which is not directly related to ensuring execution upon system startup.
- **T1542.003-Bootkit**: This technique involves using a bootkit to gain persistent access, which can ensure execution upon system startup. However, it is more specific to boot-level persistence and might be overkill for the context provided.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The CTI outline mentions that the RATs used by the attack groups, such as 'CT/NewCT', employ a 'CPU core check' technique to detect virtualized environments. This indicates that the malware is aware of its execution environment.
2. After bypassing these checks, the next step would be to ensure the RAT can execute upon system startup. This is a common requirement for malware to maintain persistence.
3. Among the given options, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution directly addresses the need to ensure the malware executes upon system startup.

### Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
