Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The adversaries use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information.
- **Initial Access**: 
  - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
  - Spear-phishing with MS Word or PowerPoint documents exploiting specific vulnerabilities.
- **Defense Evasion**: 
  - Backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
  - These scripts are then executed to download additional malware.
- **Credential Access**: 
  - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
- **Collection**: 
  - File-stealer module collects specific file types and uploads them to the C2 server.
- **Command and Control**: 
  - The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
  - Resilient communications using encrypted C2 server locations hidden in comments on legitimate websites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the use of spear-phishing emails with exploit documents for initial access and before employing encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The spear-phishing emails with exploit documents are clearly part of the initial access phase.
- **Defense Evasion**: The encoded blobs are used to bypass detection and download additional malware, which is part of the defense evasion phase.

We need to find a technique that fits between these two phases.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves using Lua scripts for command and control. It does not fit the sequence as it is more related to C2.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. It could be a plausible fit as it could be used to execute the PowerShell scripts after initial access.
- **C: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves using local accounts for privilege escalation. It does not fit the sequence as it is more related to privilege escalation.
- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. It does not fit the sequence as it is more related to credential access.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the PowerShell scripts after initial access and before employing encoded blobs to bypass detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
