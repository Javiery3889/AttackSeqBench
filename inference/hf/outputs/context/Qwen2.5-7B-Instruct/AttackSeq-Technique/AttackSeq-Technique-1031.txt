Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Defense Evasion**: The Kingslayer backdoor used a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm and was signed with a stolen code signing private key.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2.
- **Others**: The campaign targeted sysadmins of large enterprises, and the backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that facilitated the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion before it employed the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. It doesn't directly relate to software subversion.
- **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of software components. It aligns with the context of the backdoor being signed with a stolen code signing private key.
- **T1021.005-VNC**: This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access. It doesn't fit the context of software subversion.
- **T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software. It doesn't fit the context of software subversion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Kingslayer backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key, which indicates that the attackers had control over the software supply chain.
- The stolen code signing private key was compromised between 09 April 2015 to 25 April 2015, which suggests that the attackers had access to the software packaging system.
- The use of a stolen code signing private key to sign the backdoor indicates a sophisticated software subversion technique.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that facilitated the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion is **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**.

### Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
