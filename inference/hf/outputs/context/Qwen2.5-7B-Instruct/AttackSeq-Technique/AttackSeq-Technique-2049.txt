Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used fake personas and a fictitious news organization to gather information on targets.
   - **Resource Development:** They created these personas and the fictitious news organization.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear-phishing messages on social media to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used low-tech approaches to avoid traditional security defenses.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvested corporate and personal email credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** They used malware to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after harvesting corporate and personal email credentials to facilitate movement within the target's networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is already covered in the reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material:** This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which is not directly related to moving within the network.
   - **T1547.015-Login Items:** This technique involves adding login items to the victim's system to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to moving within the network.
   - **T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves deploying software to the victim's system, which can be used to facilitate movement within the network by installing backdoors or other tools.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the most plausible technique for facilitating movement within the target's networks after harvesting credentials would be the deployment of software that can be used to move laterally. This aligns with the use of malware to exfiltrate data, which is mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
