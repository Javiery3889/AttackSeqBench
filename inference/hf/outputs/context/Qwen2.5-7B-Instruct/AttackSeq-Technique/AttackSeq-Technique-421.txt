Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides details on various cyber attack techniques and phases. The key points related to the initial access and reconnaissance phase are:
- **Initial Access**: The report mentions that the Citrix systems were compromised by exploiting critical software vulnerabilities and employing password spraying techniques.
- **Reconnaissance**: The ENISA Threat Landscape report discusses the use of active scanning to gather information about vulnerabilities in the target.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely involved gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target through the Reconnaissance phase before the Citrix systems were exploited.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. It does not directly relate to gathering information about vulnerabilities.
- **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves the adversary actively scanning the target to identify vulnerabilities. This aligns well with the context of gathering information about vulnerabilities.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to gathering information about vulnerabilities.
- **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into image files to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to gathering information about vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the Citrix systems were compromised by exploiting critical software vulnerabilities, which implies that the adversaries had prior knowledge of these vulnerabilities.
- The ENISA Threat Landscape report discusses the use of active scanning to gather information about vulnerabilities, which is a common technique used in the reconnaissance phase.
- Among the given options, T1595-Active Scanning is the most relevant technique for gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target.

### Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning
