Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing was used to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** The downloader installed the backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed obfuscation, packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Targeted credentials by scanning for key and certificate files.
   - **Discovery:** Conducted network and system discovery.
   - **Collection:** Staged and encrypted collected data.
   - **Command and Control:** Used standard FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication, with fallback channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to transmit files to the C&C servers after they were staged and encrypted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Machete used standard FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication. It also states that the malware could download additional files for execution and use FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.
   - The question specifies that the files were staged and encrypted before transmission, which aligns with the exfiltration process.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network configurations, which is not related to exfiltration.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** - This technique involves exfiltration over a non-C2 protocol, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique involves exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the use of FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning** - This technique involves active scanning for vulnerabilities, which is not related to exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
