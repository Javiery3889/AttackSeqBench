Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with phishing documents containing malicious macros.
   - **Execution:** The malicious macro embedded in the Excel file executed a PowerShell script, which in turn wrote and executed an executable file.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor program checked for specific parameters and wrote startup items for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor performed checks to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor gathered host information.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:** The backdoor used complex DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used after the backdoor gathered host information to establish communication with the C2 server and execute commands.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This does not align with the use of DNS tunneling for communication.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using one protocol to hide the use of another protocol. DNS tunneling is a form of protocol tunneling where data is hidden within DNS queries and responses.
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves using pluggable authentication modules to bypass authentication mechanisms. This is not related to the communication technique used.
   - **T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into a web page or other content to execute malicious code. This does not align with the use of DNS tunneling for communication.

Given the information in the CTI outline, the backdoor used DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for this communication method is T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

**Final Answer: B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
