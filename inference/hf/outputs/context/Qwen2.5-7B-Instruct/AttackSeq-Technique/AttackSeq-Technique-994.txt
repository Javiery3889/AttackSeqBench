To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the CTI outline and analyze the question step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attack began with a phishing email containing a link to a SharePoint URL that downloaded a ZIP file. The ZIP file included a VBS script that dropped a JavaScript backdoor.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker used RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT, which connected to a specific domain.
3. **Discovery**: The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike and conducted reconnaissance.
4. **Collection**: Data was exfiltrated using SmartFTP.
5. **Command and Control**: The CARBANAK RAT beacons to a specific IP address.
6. **Exfiltration**: Data was stolen using SmartFTP.
7. **Impact**: RYUK ransomware was deployed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attacker connected to the C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and executed additional payloads through reflection methods to establish backdoor access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native system APIs to perform actions. It is not directly related to connecting to a C2 server or establishing backdoor access.
- **T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces to interact with network devices. It is not directly related to the C2 server or backdoor access.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. This could be relevant as the CARBANAK RAT communicates on a non-standard port (443).
- **T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves infecting shared content to spread malware. It is not directly related to the C2 server or backdoor access.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that would occur before connecting to the C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and establishing backdoor access would be the initial access and privilege escalation steps. The CARBANAK RAT is a form of malware that would be installed after gaining initial access and escalating privileges. The technique that aligns with this sequence is T1571-Non-Standard Port, as it involves the communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
