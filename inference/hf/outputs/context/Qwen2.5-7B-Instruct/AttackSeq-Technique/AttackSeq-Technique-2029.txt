Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Seaduke is used for hiding and exfiltrating data.
   - **Credential Access:** Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from MS Exchange Server.
   - **Collection:** Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information, updates bot configurations, uploads files, and has a self-delete function.
   - **Exfiltration:** Seaduke is used to exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files for operational control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The key TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Collection: Detailed bot/system information.
     - Updating bot configurations.
     - Uploading files.
   - The question is asking about the next step after these actions, which is likely to be operational control or further data manipulation.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot:** This technique involves using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to boot a system. It does not fit the context of updating bot configurations and uploading files.
   - **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves retrieving data from a configuration repository. While it is related to configuration, it does not directly follow the actions of updating and uploading files.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through multiple systems. It could be a method to maintain persistence and control over the bot, but it is not the immediate next step after updating configurations and uploading files.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to obfuscate the data. Given that Seaduke employs many layers of encryption and obfuscation, it is plausible that the Duke group would encode the data they are uploading and controlling.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
