Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The Geumseong121 APT hacking group distributed a malicious app via a website disguised as a fundraising service for North Korean defectors.
- **Defense Evasion**: The attackers made efforts to avoid suspicion by disguising the North Korean fundraising apps as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the technique used to distribute the malicious app before the attackers evaded suspicion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. The CTI outline does not mention any specific vulnerability being exploited.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. The CTI outline describes the attackers using a website disguised as a fundraising service to distribute the malicious app, which is a form of phishing.
- **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts to avoid detection. This is mentioned in the "Defense Evasion" section, not in the initial distribution.
- **T1037.004-RC Scripts**: This technique involves using resource configuration (RC) scripts to perform actions. The CTI outline does not mention any RC scripts being used for distribution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malicious app was distributed via a website disguised as a fundraising service for North Korean defectors. This is a classic example of phishing, where the attackers tricked users into installing the app.
- The other techniques mentioned in the answer choices are related to hiding artifacts or exploiting vulnerabilities, which are not described in the initial distribution phase.

### Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
