Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing campaign using malicious MS Office documents.
- **Execution**: Malicious macros download additional payloads, including the RMS tool.
- **Persistence**: RMS executable is added to the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USERS' hive and launched via a 'Run' key.
- **Defense Evasion**: RMS tool is used for reconnaissance and lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that allowed the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure after the download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) communications. It does not directly pertain to maintaining contact with the C2 server.
- **T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves using JavaScript for C2 communications. However, the CTI outline does not mention JavaScript being used for C2.
- **T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software to maintain access to the target network. The RMS tool, which is a legitimate remote administration tool, is used for this purpose.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. The question is about maintaining contact with the C2 server, not the initial delivery of malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The RMS tool, which is a remote access software, is used for reconnaissance and lateral movement within the network.
- The RMS tool is also used to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure, which aligns with the T1219-Remote Access Software technique.

### Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software
