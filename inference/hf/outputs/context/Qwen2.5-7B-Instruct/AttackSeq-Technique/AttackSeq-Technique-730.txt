Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers used email attachments (Excel, Word, PDF) and Java exploitation (Rhino exploit) to gain initial access.
- **Execution**: The main component was set up to handle further communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules.
- **Others**: The campaign involved sophisticated techniques to hide the C&C server's location, including dynamic resolution and other evasion techniques.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the 'Red October' campaign's C&C servers in hiding the 'mothership' control server's location.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interpreters to execute commands. It does not directly relate to hiding the C&C server's location.
- **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to hiding the C&C server's location.
- **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving network addresses, which can be used to hide the location of the C&C server by using different IP addresses or domain names.
- **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate between systems. While it can be used for communication, it does not directly relate to hiding the C&C server's location.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the attackers reused information harvested from infected networks, including stolen credentials, and had a unique architecture that allowed for quick extension of features and resistance to C&C server takeover.
- The unique aspect of hiding the C&C server's location suggests a technique that involves dynamic changes in network communication, which aligns with T1568-Dynamic Resolution.
- T1568-Dynamic Resolution allows the C&C server to use different IP addresses or domain names, making it difficult to track the location of the 'mothership' control server.

### Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
