Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The adversary used spearphishing emails with a PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.
2. **Execution**: The adversary used DLL Hijacking to execute malware.
3. **Persistence**: The adversary used the Run registry key and DLL Hijacking to maintain persistence.
4. **Infrastructure**: The adversary used compromised VPSs to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and C2s.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that ensures malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW (Malicious Object Tracking Warning) after using HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **HTML Smuggling**: This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is implied that the adversary used a method to bypass security controls.
- **Ensuring Malicious Payloads are Not Tagged with MOTW**: This suggests a technique that helps in evading detection and tagging by security systems.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malicious code, which is not directly related to bypassing security controls or evading detection.
- **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves using compromised infrastructure to host malicious content. While it is related to hosting ENVYSCOUT, it does not directly address the issue of evading detection.
- **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. This could be relevant to bypassing security controls and ensuring malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW.
- **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves using resource forks to hide malicious code. While it can help in evading detection, it is not directly related to the context of bypassing security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions the use of compromised VPSs to host ENVYSCOUT, which aligns with T1584-Compromise Infrastructure.
- However, the question specifically asks about a technique to ensure malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW after bypassing security controls.
- T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is the most relevant technique as it involves subverting trust controls, which can help in bypassing security measures and ensuring that malicious payloads are not flagged.

### Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
