To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline primarily focuses on the creation and management of C2 infrastructure. Key points include:
- Resource Development: Insikt Group identified and tracked malicious C2 infrastructure.
- Command and Control: Over 10,000 unique C2 servers were observed, with various C2 families like Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, and QakBot.
- The study notes that threat actors create and modify C2 infrastructure to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after threat actors acquired servers through compromise or legitimate purchase and used them to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control purposes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the CTI outline:

- **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email to deliver malware. It is more relevant to initial compromise rather than configuring C2 infrastructure.

- **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves acquiring the ability to perform actions on a system. While it could be part of the overall process, it is not specifically about configuring C2 infrastructure.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to a target. This is directly related to configuring C2 infrastructure, as threat actors would need to set up and use external services for Command and Control.

- **D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**
  - This technique involves creating additional local or domain groups. While it could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not specifically about configuring C2 infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline emphasizes the creation and management of C2 infrastructure, which is a core part of the Command and Control phase.
- The question specifically asks about the step that follows acquiring servers and configuring them for C2 purposes.
- Among the choices, T1133-External Remote Services (C) is the most relevant as it directly pertains to setting up and using external services for Command and Control.

### Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services
