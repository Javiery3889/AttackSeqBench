Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The outline mentions that both Moafee and DragonOK groups use spear-phishing emails as their primary attack vector.
- **Initial Access**: The outline states that the spear-phishing emails are used to gain initial access to the target networks.
- **Execution**: The outline describes the use of evasion techniques, including the 'CPU core check' technique, to ensure the payload is executed in a non-virtualized environment.
- **Persistence**: The outline mentions the use of registry entries to ensure the payload persists on the system.
- **Defense Evasion**: The outline details various evasion techniques, including environment-based evasion and the use of large file sizes.
- **Command and Control**: The outline describes the use of network beacons and plugin functionality for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that describes the activity where Moafee and DragonOK ensure the deployment of tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs to support their campaigns.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malicious code, which is not directly related to deploying backdoors and RATs.
- **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform actions on the target system, which could include deploying backdoors and RATs.
- **T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique involves defacing internal systems, which is not relevant to deploying backdoors and RATs.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is already covered by the Initial Access phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the spear-phishing emails are used for initial access, which aligns with the Initial Access phase.
- The outline then describes the execution and persistence of the payload, which involves deploying backdoors and RATs.
- The technique that best describes the deployment of these tools is T1588-Obtain Capabilities, as it encompasses the ability to perform actions on the target system, including deploying backdoors and RATs.

### Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
