Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval.
   - **Discovery:** The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host.
   - **Others:** The report mentions that the C2 servers used in the recent attacks were compromised websites in South Korea and Europe.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware performed discovery activities and started communicating with compromised websites to exfiltrate data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to hide the true nature of the communication. It is not directly related to exfiltrating data through compromised websites.
   - **T1574.014-AppDomainManager:** This technique is related to .NET application domains and is not relevant to the context of exfiltrating data through compromised websites.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, which is more about reconnaissance and not directly related to exfiltration.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server. Given that the C2 servers were compromised websites, it is likely that the malware would use an encrypted channel to exfiltrate data to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, is that the malware would use an encrypted channel to communicate with the compromised C2 servers to exfiltrate data.
   
   **Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
