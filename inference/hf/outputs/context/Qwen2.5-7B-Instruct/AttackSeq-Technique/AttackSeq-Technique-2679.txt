Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key points:
- **Execution**: ZoxPNG uses the PNG image file format for data transmission.
- **Defense Evasion**: ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication and sends a VictimSystemData structure in the HTTP Cookie header.
- **Communication Pattern**: ZoxPNG sends HTTP GET and POST requests with a PNG file containing instructions or data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before ZoxPNG established initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests by sending a PNG file containing instructions or data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which of the given answer choices aligns with the initial steps or techniques that would precede the HTTP GET request.

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which is relevant to the HTTP communication used by ZoxPNG. However, it does not specifically describe a technique that would precede the initial contact with the C2 server.

- **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
  - This technique involves rapidly changing DNS records to evade detection. It is not directly related to the initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests.

- **C: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access. It is not directly related to the initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests.

- **D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions. ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, which is a native API. This technique could be used to establish the initial contact with the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, which is a native API.
- The question asks about a technique that would precede the initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests.
- Among the given choices, T1106-Native API (D) is the most relevant as it directly involves the use of a native API, which is used by ZoxPNG for its communication.

### Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
