Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Office document containing a message in Vietnamese, which tricks the victim into enabling macros.
   - **Execution:** The document contains two base64 blobs, one for 32-bit systems and one for 64-bit systems. The appropriate blob is decoded and executed based on the victim's system architecture.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The base64 blobs are decoded using a VBS decode function, and the KerrDown DLL is dropped in a specific directory. The DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when KerrDown established communication to download its payload.
   - The key point here is the communication to download the payload from a URL.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it could be relevant, it is more general and not specifically about downloading a payload.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves the use of web services for C2 communications. Given that the payload is downloaded from a URL, this is a strong candidate.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique involves the process of removing obfuscation or decoding to reveal the true nature of a file or information. This is not relevant to the communication aspect but to the process of decrypting the payload.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations** - This technique involves determining the physical location of a target. It is not relevant to the communication aspect of downloading a payload.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for the communication to download the payload from a URL is T1102-Web Service, as it directly pertains to using web services for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
