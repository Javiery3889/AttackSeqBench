Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used spear phishing emails containing malicious documents to distribute malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware infection process involves downloading and executing a series of files, including a base64-encoded CAB file, which contains a BAT file for the main payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The threat actor used a UAC bypass module to prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing, allowing the malware to execute without alerting the user.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up after the batch file was executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique is related to the initial access method (spear phishing emails), not the execution or defense evasion.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique directly addresses the method used to bypass UAC, which is relevant to the question.
   - **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs:** This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data:** This technique is not relevant to the execution or defense evasion described in the CTI outline.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of a UAC bypass module to prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing.
   - The UAC bypass is a method to evade detection and ensure the malware executes without user intervention.
   - The ATT&CK technique T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism directly corresponds to the use of a UAC bypass module.

**Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
