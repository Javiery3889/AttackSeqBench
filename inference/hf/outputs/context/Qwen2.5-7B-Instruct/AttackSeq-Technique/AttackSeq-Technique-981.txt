Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the Komplex Trojan, which drops the XAgent malware.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent component initializes, with the BootXLoader module checking for debugger presence and waiting for internet connectivity.
   - **Persistence:** The XAgent ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.
   - **Credential Access:** The Password module within XAgent obtains passwords from Firefox browser profiles.
   - **Discovery:** The InfoOS and RemoteShell modules gather system information and list installed applications.
   - **Command and Control:** The XAgent communicates with C&C servers using the HTTPChannel module.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated using the msgPacket structure, encrypted with RC4, and sent in a POST request.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to evade detection when initializing the XAgent component's main module (BootXLoader).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1600-Weaken Encryption:** This technique is about weakening encryption to make it easier to decrypt data. It does not fit the context of evading detection.
   - **T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols to move files. It is not related to evading detection.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating processes to avoid detection by process discovery tools. This aligns with the context of evading detection when initializing the main module.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. While it is related to evading detection, it is more specific to sandbox environments and not directly related to the process discovery context.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for evading detection when initializing the XAgent component's main module is T1057-Process Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1057-Process Discovery**
