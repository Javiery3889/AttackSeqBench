Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers used Telegram channels to distribute Raccoon stealer and bypass blocking of active C&C servers.
- **Execution**: The Raccoon stealer collects various types of data and communicates with C&C servers.
- **Command and Control**: The Raccoon stealer communicated with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection. The C&C servers were encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that obscures communication between systems and maintains access undetected after the initial access and execution of the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. However, the CTI outline mentions Telegram, which is a messaging service, not a web service.
- **T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. The CTI outline does not mention cloud services.
- **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources. The CTI outline does not mention Kerberos or network resource access.
- **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. The CTI outline mentions that the Raccoon stealer communicated with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection, which aligns with the idea of using traffic signaling to maintain undetected access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Raccoon stealer communicated with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection. This aligns with the concept of traffic signaling, which is used to maintain undetected access.
- None of the other techniques (Web Service, Cloud Services, or Pass the Ticket) are mentioned in the CTI outline and do not fit the context of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
