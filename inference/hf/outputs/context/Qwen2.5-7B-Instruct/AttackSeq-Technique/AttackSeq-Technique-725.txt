Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through malicious documents.
2. **Initial Access**: Using malicious documents to deliver the Sharpshooter downloader.
3. **Execution**: Executing the macro to download the Rising Sun implant.
4. **Persistence**: Ensuring the Rising Sun implant remains on the system by placing it in the startup folder.
5. **Command and Control**: Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred immediately before the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests. The sequence of TTPs in the outline is clear, and we need to identify the TTP that logically follows persistence and precedes C2 communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by placing the second-stage binary in the startup folder.
- **Command and Control**: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

The TTP that logically occurs between persistence and C2 communication is likely to be a step that prepares the system for communication. Given the context, the most plausible TTP is one that involves gathering or checking system information to ensure the implant can communicate effectively.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute code, which is not directly related to system checks or gathering victim identity information.
- **T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which could be used to gather system information or check for specific configurations.
- **T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions or configurations, which is a logical step before C2 communication.
- **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is more related to reconnaissance and less likely to occur immediately before C2 communication.

Given the context and the need to ensure the system is in a state where C2 communication can occur, **T1497.001-System Checks** is the most plausible TTP.

### Final Answer: C: T1497.001-System Checks
