Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors used spear phishing campaigns with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.
   - **Execution:** The RTF documents appear legitimate but contain malicious content that infects the user with QuasarRAT.
   - **Persistence:** The malware creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with the C2 server tautiaos.com.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used during the Reconnaissance phase to identify targeted recipients who interacted with the spear phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT:** This technique involves using AutoHotKey or AutoIT scripts to automate tasks. It does not align with the context of identifying targeted recipients through spear phishing.
   - **T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching open technical databases for information. It is not relevant to the context of identifying targeted recipients through spear phishing.
   - **T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information. While it is related to spear phishing, it is more about the content of the phishing emails rather than the process of identifying targeted recipients.
   - **T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves convincing a user to execute a payload. However, it is more about the execution phase rather than the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes a spear phishing campaign where the threat actors used domains and themes mimicking well-known think tank organizations to target specific recipients. The key aspect here is the selection of targets based on their interaction with the spear phishing emails.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique in this context is T1598-Phishing for Information, as it directly relates to the process of identifying and targeting specific individuals through phishing.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
