Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to install Tuyul IRC bot.
   - **Execution:** Tuyul botnet uses Perl scripts for command execution.
   - **Persistence:** Tuyul periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Binary version of Tuyul goes undetected by antivirus and uses PHP web shells.
   - **Others:** The botnet communicates with a C2 server at irc[.]localroot[.]xyz.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used when the Tuyul botnet communicated with its C2 server (irc[.]localroot[.]xyz).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the communication technique used with the C2 server. However, it does not provide any indication of fast flux DNS, scheduled tasks, or time providers.
   - The Tuyul botnet is described as using an IRC bot, which is a common method for C2 communication. IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol that allows for real-time text communication over the internet, often used by malware for C2 communication due to its simplicity and ease of use.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. IRC is an application layer protocol, making this a plausible choice.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS** - This technique involves rapidly changing DNS records to evade detection. There is no mention of DNS changes in the CTI outline.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to run malware. The CTI outline mentions persistence through a bash script but does not indicate scheduled tasks.
   - **D: T1547.003-Time Providers** - This technique involves using time providers to synchronize time, which is not relevant to the C2 communication method described.

Given the context and the nature of IRC communication, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
