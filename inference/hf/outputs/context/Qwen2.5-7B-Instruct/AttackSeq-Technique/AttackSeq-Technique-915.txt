Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the Tuyul botnet's attack sequence, including the following key tactics:
- **Execution**: The malware uses Perl scripts and shell commands to execute on victim systems.
- **Persistence**: The malware periodically downloads a bash script to maintain its presence.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses undetected binary versions and PHP web shells.
- **Command and Control**: The malware uses an IRC-based C&C server and development servers protected by Cloudflare.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems. The answer choices are:
- A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- B: T1133-External Remote Services
- C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. Given that the Tuyul botnet uses PHP web shells, it is plausible that the initial access was through exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly facing application.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection. While the C&C server is hosted externally, this technique is more about maintaining the connection rather than the initial access.
- **T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique is about making asynchronous calls to a remote system. It is not directly related to the initial access but rather to the communication between the botnet and the C&C server.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This is the technique used by the Tuyul botnet to execute commands on victim systems, but it is not the initial access technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Tuyul botnet likely used a publicly facing application to gain initial access to the victim systems. This is supported by the use of PHP web shells, which are often used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- The other techniques (T1133, T1055.004, and T1059) are more related to maintaining the connection, executing commands, or the communication between the botnet and the C&C server, respectively.

### Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
