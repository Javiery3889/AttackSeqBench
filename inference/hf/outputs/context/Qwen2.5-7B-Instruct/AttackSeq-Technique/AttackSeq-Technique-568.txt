To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence from the CTI outline and then evaluate the answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The malware was delivered via a backdoor using a legitimate Windows Defender Core Process (MsMpEng.exe) with a legal digital signature.
2. **Execution**: The malicious executable had upgraded features, including the ability to interact with Dropbox API and bypass UAC.
3. **Persistence**: The malware registered itself as a startup program or a system service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware used a UAC bypass technique.
5. **Discovery**: The malware collected basic information such as IP address, hostname, username, OS version, and searched for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
6. **Command and Control**: The malware could connect to a C&C server and interact with Dropbox for file operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the Collection phase, specifically which ATT&CK technique was used to gather screen recording files after the malware collected basic information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1036.006-Space after Filename**: This technique involves using a space in the filename to evade detection. This does not align with gathering screen recording files.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen, which aligns with the question of gathering screen recording files.
- **T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows Registry, which is not related to screen recording.
- **T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves using messaging applications for data exfiltration or command and control, which is not related to screen recording.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware collected basic information during the Discovery phase.
- The question asks about the Collection phase, where the malware would gather additional data.
- The most plausible technique for gathering screen recording files is T1113-Screen Capture, as it directly relates to capturing the screen.

### Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture
