To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the CTI outline and the question step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a series of TTPs used by APT10, including:
- Initial Access (spear phishing)
- Execution (malware deployment, reconnaissance, credential theft)
- Persistence (scheduled tasks, Windows services)
- Privilege Escalation (using stolen credentials)
- Defense Evasion (custom malware, DLL hijacking)
- Credential Access (mimikatz, PwDump)
- Discovery (internal reconnaissance)
- Lateral Movement (using MSP infrastructure)
- Command and Control (dynamic-DNS domains, Robocopy, PSCP)
- Exfiltration (pushing and pulling data)

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP that occurred before APT10 staged data for exfiltration using multi-part archives in the Collection phase, leveraging remote command execution scripts. This implies a TTP that is directly related to the preparation for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves resolving a domain name to an IP address at runtime, which is more related to command and control infrastructure rather than data staging.
- **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules, which is not directly related to data staging or exfiltration.
- **T1074-Data Staged**: This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which aligns with the question's requirement.
- **T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**: This technique involves using a virtual private server for command and control, which is more related to command and control infrastructure rather than data staging.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the TTP occurred before data staging for exfiltration.
- T1074-Data Staged is the most relevant technique as it directly pertains to the preparation of data for exfiltration.
- The other techniques do not align as closely with the specific requirement of data staging before exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: T1074-Data Staged
