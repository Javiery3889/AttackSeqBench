Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
2. **Execution**: Fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads.
3. **Persistence**: Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Mimikatz for credential dumping.
5. **Credential Access**: Harvesting credentials using Mimikatz.
6. **Discovery**: Lateral movement and infection of new machines.
7. **Lateral Movement**: Using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
8. **Command and Control**: HTTP and DNS tunneling, and a novel backdoor using Microsoft Outlook.
9. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique used to bypass application whitelisting and security software after privilege escalation using Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which technique from the answer choices is most likely to be used to bypass application whitelisting and security software after privilege escalation.

- **A: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching** - This technique is not relevant to the context of the CTI outline, as it pertains to Linux environments and not Windows.
- **B: T1087-Account Discovery** - This technique involves discovering valid accounts, which is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting.
- **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. This could be used to bypass application whitelisting by injecting malicious code into a trusted process.
- **D: T1080-Taint Shared Content** - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. It is not directly related to bypassing application whitelisting.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the CTI outline, the OceanLotus Group would likely use a technique that allows them to inject malicious code into a trusted process to bypass application whitelisting and security software. The most plausible technique is **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**.

**Final Answer: C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
