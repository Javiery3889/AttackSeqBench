Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader to execute the malware.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to ensure persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
6. **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
7. **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the next TTP after CosmicDuke conducts discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including non-English filenames.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question specifies that CosmicDuke has just completed the discovery phase. The next logical step would be to gather information from the victim's system. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This TTP involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks. The CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' for persistence, but this is not the immediate next step after discovery.
- **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This TTP involves accessing and exfiltrating data from the clipboard. The CTI outline does not mention CosmicDuke accessing clipboard data, so this is unlikely.
- **C: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This TTP involves loading and using kernel modules or extensions. The CTI outline does not mention CosmicDuke using kernel modules, so this is unlikely.
- **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This TTP involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. The CTI outline does not mention CosmicDuke capturing screenshots, so this is unlikely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, the most plausible next step after discovery would be to gather credentials or other sensitive information from the victim's system. The CTI outline explicitly mentions that CosmicDuke targets a variety of software to steal credentials and other information.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery (T1033)
- Credential Access (T1003)

Since the question asks for the next TTP after discovery, the most logical answer is the TTP that involves gathering credentials.

**Final Answer: D**
