Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the gathering of information about potential victims before the initial access via phishing emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1565-Data Manipulation**: This technique involves altering data to mislead or manipulate the victim. It does not fit the context of gathering information about potential victims.
- **T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust. It is not relevant to the gathering of information about potential victims.
- **T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information about potential victims. This aligns with the context of the CTI outline, where the initial access was achieved through phishing emails.
- **T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: This technique involves searching open technical databases for information. It is not relevant to the context of the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
- The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred during the gathering of information about potential victims.
- Among the given choices, **T1598-Phishing for Information** is the only technique that aligns with the context of the CTI outline, as it involves using phishing to gather information about potential victims.

### Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information
