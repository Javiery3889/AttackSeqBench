Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with phishing emails containing Office documents.
   - **Execution:** Office Macro Scripts are used to load the Chinotto malware.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected and exfiltrated.
   - **Command and Control:** HTTP requests and Golang malware are used for C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is sent to the attackers' infrastructure using specific PHP scripts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the technique used to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses after the execution of Office Macro Scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment:** This technique is about using spearphishing to deliver malware. It does not directly address the evasion of detection during the execution phase.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. While it is related to execution, it does not specifically address evasion.
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which can help evade detection by anti-virus software that scans files on disk.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It can be used to evade detection by altering the normal execution path.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions the use of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware. This indicates that the malware is likely loaded in memory and not written to disk, which aligns with the concept of Reflective Code Loading.
   - Reflective Code Loading can help the malware evade detection by anti-virus software that typically scans files on disk.
   - Hijacking the execution flow (T1574) is a more general technique that can be used for various purposes, but it is not as specific to the evasion of detection during the loading phase as Reflective Code Loading.

**Final Answer: C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
