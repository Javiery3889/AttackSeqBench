Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments (Word documents or executables).
   - **Persistence:** Dropping an .EXE file packed with UPX, copying to the %System% folder, and adding a registry entry for automatic execution.
   - **Collection:** RAT controller issues various commands to the compromised computer.
   - **Command and Control:** Encrypted network communication using a custom encryption method (XOR and rotation).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the FAKEM RAT disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated this to hinder detection through encryption manipulation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1600-Weaken Encryption:** This technique involves reducing the effectiveness of encryption to facilitate analysis or exfiltration. However, it does not directly address the disguise of network traffic.
   - **T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs for scheduling tasks. It is not related to disguising network traffic or encryption manipulation.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to hide malicious activities. This aligns with the description of disguising network traffic to look like legitimate protocols.
   - **T1562.007-Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall:** This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud firewalls to evade detection. It is not related to disguising network traffic or encryption manipulation.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence and the context provided is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
