Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grabit malware is delivered via a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment containing a malicious macro.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies common registry entries, such as startup configurations, to ensure it remains active.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates over obvious channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after the malware established persistence by modifying common registry entries with startup configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to persistence or registry modifications.
   - **T1003.003-NTDS:** This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database, which is not mentioned in the context of the malware's persistence mechanism.
   - **T1546.001-Change Default File Association:** This technique involves changing the default file association to execute malware when a specific file type is opened. This could be a step after persistence is established, as it would allow the malware to execute when certain files are opened.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is the initial access method, not a persistence technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already established persistence by modifying registry entries for startup configurations.
   - The next logical step would be to ensure that the malware can execute when specific files are opened, which aligns with changing default file associations.
   - T1546.001-Change Default File Association is the most plausible technique that would follow the establishment of persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**
