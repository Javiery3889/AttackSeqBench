Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Malware spread via watering hole attacks.
- **Execution**: Multi-stage infection process involving exploitation of VBScript engine vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174) and PowerShell to download a DLL. The DLL then runs in PowerShell, checks for antivirus software, and exits if any are found. It also exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The downloader exploits CVE-2015-1701 to acquire Local Privilege Escalation.
- **Defense Evasion**: The first stage downloader exits if it detects any antivirus software processes.
- **Discovery**: The SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.
- **Collection**: The backdoor supports various commands for data collection.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.
- **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that ensures the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup, after exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation and before conducting discovery using GitHub gists.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique is not relevant to ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup.
- **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load a malicious DLL at system startup. This could be a plausible method to ensure the backdoor remains active.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not relevant to ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring a malicious program runs at system boot or logon. This is a plausible method to ensure the backdoor remains active.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the technique should ensure the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup.
- The backdoor needs to be active before it can perform discovery using GitHub gists.
- Both T1546.010-AppInit DLLs and T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution are relevant to ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup.
- However, T1546.010-AppInit DLLs is a more specific and direct method for ensuring a DLL is loaded at system startup, which aligns well with the execution of the SLUB backdoor.

### Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
