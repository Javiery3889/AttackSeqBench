Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** ShadowPad is introduced as a successor to PlugX, used in various supply-chain attacks.
   - **Execution:** ShadowPad's modular design allows for dynamic loading of plugins, and the controller can modify various settings.
   - **Persistence:** ShadowPad can remotely deploy new plugins, but the control interfaces are hardcoded in the controller. This suggests a high level of control by the developer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that enhances anti-forensics capabilities under long-term espionage in victim environments, following the persistence mechanism described in the CTI outline.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves sharing code or modules between different malware instances to reduce the attack surface and improve efficiency. It does not directly relate to anti-forensics.
   - **T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:** This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not pertain to anti-forensics.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to make detection and analysis more difficult. It aligns well with enhancing anti-forensics capabilities.
   - **T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation:** This technique involves generating requests for multi-factor authentication to bypass security controls. It does not relate to anti-forensics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes ShadowPad's persistence mechanism, which involves remote deployment of plugins with hardcoded control interfaces.
   - The question asks for a technique that enhances anti-forensics capabilities, which means making it harder for forensic analysts to detect and analyze the malware.
   - Among the given options, T1564-Hide Artifacts is the most relevant as it directly addresses hiding or obfuscating artifacts, which would make it more difficult to detect and analyze the malware in a long-term espionage context.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
