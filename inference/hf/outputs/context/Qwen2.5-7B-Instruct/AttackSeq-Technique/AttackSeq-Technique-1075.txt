Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key points:
- **Reconnaissance**: The attackers used system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance.
- **Execution**: The attackers used a backdoor named CommsCacher and the Windows command line to run commands.
- **Persistence**: They created services using `sc.exe` and placed shortcuts in the startup folder.
- **Privilege Escalation**: They created local administrator accounts.
- **Defense Evasion**: They used various techniques to evade detection, including hiding malware in hidden folders.
- **Discovery**: They collected information about users, network settings, and processes.
- **Lateral Movement**: They used compromised privileged accounts to move laterally.
- **Command and Control**: They used standard HTTP to connect to C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique that enabled the Lazarus Group to gain initial access to the pharmaceutical company's network through targeted communication channels after reconnaissance activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network configuration details. While it is part of the reconnaissance phase, it does not directly describe the initial access method.
- **T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This technique involves using voice-based phishing. The CTI outline does not mention any voice-based communication or phishing.
- **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves compromising cloud accounts. The CTI outline does not mention any cloud-based activities.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using malicious emails or documents to gain initial access. The CTI outline mentions the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers, which is a form of phishing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers initiated the attack by delivering malicious documents containing job offers to company employees. These documents activated malicious macros, which is a form of phishing.
- The question asks about the technique that enabled the group to gain initial access through targeted communication channels, which aligns with the use of phishing to deliver the malicious documents.

### Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
