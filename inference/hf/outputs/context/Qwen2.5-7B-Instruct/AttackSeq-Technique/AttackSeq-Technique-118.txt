Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- **Execution**: Deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for persistence and command execution.
- **Persistence**: Deployed webshells and registered 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
- **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and harvest credentials.
- **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
- **Impact**: Deployed wipers ('Apostle' and DEADWOOD) to destroy data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1021-Remote Services**: This tactic involves using remote services to maintain access. While 'IPsec Helper' is registered as a service, this tactic is more about the method of persistence rather than command execution.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This tactic involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise. This is not directly related to command execution or minimizing detection.
- **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This tactic involves injecting code into the memory of a process to execute arbitrary code. This is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This tactic involves executing commands through an intermediary, which can help in minimizing detection. 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP, which can be considered an indirect method of command execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, based on a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses. This communication is an indirect method of command execution.
- The question specifically asks about ensuring command execution and minimizing detection after achieving persistence. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor's communication method over HTTP can be seen as an indirect command execution method, which helps in minimizing detection by making the communication less obvious.

### Final Answer: D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution
