Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Grabit malware is delivered via a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment containing a malicious macro named AutoOpen.
- **Credential Access**: Grabit includes a Keylogger functionality.
- **Command and Control**: Grabit's 'call home' functionality communicates over obvious channels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely happened to maintain persistence on the infected system after the malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server for downloading itself via a malicious macro.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1008 - Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative methods to maintain access if the primary method is detected or blocked. The CTI outline does not mention any fallback channels.
- **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malware runs automatically when the system boots or when a user logs on. The CTI outline mentions that the malware includes a Keylogger and that it communicates over obvious channels, which suggests it might be designed to run automatically.
- **T1546.011 - Application Shimming**: This technique involves modifying the behavior of legitimate applications to perform malicious actions. The CTI outline does not mention any application shimming.
- **T1546.001 - Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing the default file associations to execute malicious code when a file is opened. The CTI outline does not mention any changes in file associations.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- The malware is delivered via a malicious macro, which suggests it might be designed to run automatically when the system boots or when a user logs on.
- The Keylogger functionality indicates that the malware is designed to collect sensitive information, which is a common goal of malware that runs persistently.
- The 'call home' functionality suggests that the malware communicates with a remote server, but it does not necessarily imply that the malware is designed to run persistently.

### Final Answer: 
Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK technique to maintain persistence on the infected system is **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
