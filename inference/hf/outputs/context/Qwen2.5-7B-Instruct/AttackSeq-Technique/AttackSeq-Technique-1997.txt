Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
- **Execution**: Uses unnamed event objects, anonymous pipes, and inter-process communication.
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses GetTempPathW, InternetOpenW, and HttpOpenRequestW.
- **Collection**: Collects data using systeminfo and tasklist commands, base64 encoding, and CryptBinaryToStringA.
- **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data using the same POST request structure.
- **Others**: Uses CryptAcquireContextA, CryptCreateHash, and WinExec.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to enumerate files and directories across the targeted system, including Desktop and user-specific folders, after the data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves exploiting unquoted paths in system configuration files. It is not directly related to enumerating files and directories.
- **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves discovering peripheral devices. It is not relevant to enumerating files and directories.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system. It aligns with the collection of data using systeminfo and tasklist commands.
- **T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves collecting data automatically. While it is related to data collection, it does not specifically address the enumeration of files and directories.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions the use of the `systeminfo` and `tasklist` commands, which are used to gather information about the system, including the list of processes and system details.
- These commands are part of the data collection phase, which is described in the CTI outline under the "Collection" section.
- The question specifically asks about the technique used to enumerate files and directories, which is directly related to the data collection process.

Given the context and the specific commands mentioned in the CTI outline, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

### Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
