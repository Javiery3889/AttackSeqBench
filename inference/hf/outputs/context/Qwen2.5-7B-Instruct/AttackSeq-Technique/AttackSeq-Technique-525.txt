Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The INOCNATION campaign used a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client.
   - **Execution:** The RAT installer executed a malicious DLL payload, which was obfuscated and used anti-behavioral analysis techniques.
   - **Persistence:** The malware set up a persistence mechanism by creating a registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used various techniques including XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and a mangled MZ header.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used when INOCNATION's malware established secure communications with the C2 server while adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The key points in the question are:
     - Secure communications with the C2 server.
     - Additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic. While it can be used for obfuscation, it doesn't directly address the use of SSL/TLS encryption.
     - **B: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol** - This technique involves using RDP for C2 communications. It does not align with the use of SSL/TLS encryption.
     - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communications, which aligns with the use of SSL/TLS encryption. It also fits the requirement of adding an additional layer of obfuscation.
     - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox detection. It does not align with the use of SSL/TLS encryption for C2 communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of an encrypted channel (T1573) for secure communications with the C2 server while adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
