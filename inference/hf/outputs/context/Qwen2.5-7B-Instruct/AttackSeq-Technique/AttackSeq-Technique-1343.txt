Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: The ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded and launched using mscoree.dll and AppLaunch.exe.
2. **Persistence**: The Windows Task Scheduler was used for persistence.
3. **Credential Access**: Domain authentication credentials were stolen and used to spread the attack.
4. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers was established using domains from NameSilo, GoDaddy, and ENOM.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the technique used by the attackers to gain access to the victim's network before executing the backdoor using DLL hijacking.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify the technique that would allow the attackers to gain initial access to the network, which would then enable them to use DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor.

- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to gaining initial access.
- **T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This technique involves using voice-based phishing to gain access. The CTI outline does not mention any voice-based phishing activities.
- **T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique involves forcing users to authenticate to a malicious system. It does not directly relate to gaining initial access.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access. This could be a plausible method for gaining initial access, as it aligns with the idea of using a legitimate application to execute malicious code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application to execute the ShadowPad backdoor using DLL hijacking.
2. For the attackers to use this application, they must first gain access to the network.
3. Among the given options, T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the most plausible technique for gaining initial access, as it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to the network.

### Final Answer: D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
