Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key points:
- The malware, named `gpsvc.exe`, is packed with 'Enigma Protector'.
- It gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server `eye-watch[.]in`.
- The C&C server IP addresses are `125.214.195.17` and `196.29.166.218`.
- The malware communicates with the C&C using a Firefox-like User-Agent.
- Additional watering-hole attacks were observed on the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (Mexico) and a state-owned bank in Uruguay.
- The `eye-watch[.]in` domain is associated with other malicious activities, including the delivery of malware variants and a Silverlight exploit based on CVE-2016-0034.
- A list of 255 IP address strings was found in the exploit kit website code, likely used to filter traffic and deliver exploits to specific subnets, primarily targeting financial institutions in Poland and Mexico.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated gaining initial access to systems via the altered Polish Financial Supervision Authority website before the malware began execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly facing application to gain access. Given that the watering-hole attacks were observed on the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (Mexico) and a state-owned bank in Uruguay, and the `eye-watch[.]in` domain was used in these attacks, it is plausible that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application.
- **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections to gain information about the network. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly address the initial access.
- **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**: This technique involves using a rogue domain controller to gain access. There is no indication in the CTI outline that a rogue domain controller was used.
- **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access. There is no indication in the CTI outline that domain accounts were used for initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions watering-hole attacks and the use of the `eye-watch[.]in` domain, which suggests that the initial access was gained through exploiting a publicly facing application.
- The question specifically asks about the technique that facilitated gaining initial access via the altered Polish Financial Supervision Authority website, which aligns with the exploitation of a public-facing application.

**Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
