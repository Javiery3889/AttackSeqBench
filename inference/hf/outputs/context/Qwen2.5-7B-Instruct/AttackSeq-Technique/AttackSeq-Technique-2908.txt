Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
2. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
5. **Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
6. **Collection**: APT15 used various tools to export data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system. However, the CTI outline does not mention any use of local accounts for remote access.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a system. The CTI outline does not mention any external remote services.
- **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a system. The CTI outline mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials, which is a valid account.
- **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a system. The CTI outline does not mention any cloud accounts.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials, which is a valid account.
- This credential access facilitated their remote network access before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS.
- Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitated their remote access to the network is T1078-Valid Accounts.

**Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
