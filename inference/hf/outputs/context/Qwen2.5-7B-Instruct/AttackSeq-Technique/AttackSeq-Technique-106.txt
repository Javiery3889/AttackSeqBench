### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The Waterbear campaign uses a DLL loader to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload. The loader can be triggered by modifying a legitimate server application or through DLL side-loading. The payload is then injected into an existing Windows Service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses API hooking to evade detection by modifying the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware connected to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files after using API hooking to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic, which is not directly related to receiving additional payloads from external entities.
   - **T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or update software, which is not directly related to receiving additional payloads.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or data from an external source to the target environment, which aligns with the scenario of the malware receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection, which is related to the API hooking used for evasion but not directly to receiving additional payloads.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**. This technique directly aligns with the scenario where the malware connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
