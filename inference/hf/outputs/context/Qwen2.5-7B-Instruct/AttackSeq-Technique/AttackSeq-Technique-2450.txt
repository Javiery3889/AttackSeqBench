Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key steps:
1. **Initial Access**: DRAGONFISH distributes Elise malware through a malicious Word document.
2. **Execution**: The malware starts the Internet Explorer process, injects NavShExt.dll, and calls its export function.
3. **Persistence**: Uses a Run Registry key and injects hidden DLLs into iexplore.exe.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Implements anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscation, and spoofing.
5. **Command and Control**: Communicates with a hardcoded C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP that occurs after the Elise malware initiates ipaddress.com queries to obtain WAN IP addresses, leveraging system network configuration details to further its profiling activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1087.003-Email Account**: This technique involves using email accounts to gather information. It does not align with the network configuration details or the ipaddress.com queries.
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While it could be relevant, it does not directly relate to the network configuration details.
- **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal targets. It does not fit the context of network configuration details or ipaddress.com queries.
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the ipaddress.com queries and the need to further profiling activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware initiates ipaddress.com queries to obtain WAN IP addresses, which is a form of network configuration discovery.
- The question asks for a TTP that occurs after these queries and leverages system network configuration details.
- T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly involves gathering network configuration details, which aligns with the ipaddress.com queries and further profiling activities.

### Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
