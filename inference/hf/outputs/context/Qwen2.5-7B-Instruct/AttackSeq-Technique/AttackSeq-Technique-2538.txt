Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign uses blogs and microblogging services to conceal C&C server locations.
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign targets Japanese users with fake documents in Japanese.
   - **Persistence:** Malware tools are moved to the Windows temp folder and shortcut files are created in the startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - **Others:** The campaign retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used after ensuring persistence, specifically when the backdoors retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the campaign uses blogs and microblogging services to conceal C&C server locations, which aligns with the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information.
   - The question is asking about the technique used to access these blogs or microblogs to retrieve the information.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains** - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which could be relevant if the malware needs to search for specific blogs or microblogs.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to perform actions, which might be too broad and not specifically targeted at blogs or microblogs.
   - **C: T1588.005-Exploits** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities, which is not directly related to accessing blogs or microblogs.
   - **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** - This technique involves using non-standard encoding, which is not directly related to accessing blogs or microblogs.

Given the context that the malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, the most plausible technique is **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**. This technique would allow the malware to search for and access the specific blogs or microblogs containing the C&C configuration information.

**Final Answer: A**
