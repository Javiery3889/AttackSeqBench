Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - **Execution:** CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals various credentials and exports certificates.
   - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
   - **Command and Control:** CosmicDuke communicates via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav.
   - **Exfiltration:** CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types after using Discovery techniques.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1127.002-ClickOnce:** This technique involves using ClickOnce to deploy applications, which is not relevant to the context of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:** This technique involves hooking credential APIs to steal credentials, which is not directly related to gathering information from removable drives.
   - **T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:** This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not relevant to the context of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves accessing data from removable media, which aligns with the context of gathering information from removable drives.

Given the context of the question and the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves gathering information from removable drives, which aligns with the T1025-Data from Removable Media technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
