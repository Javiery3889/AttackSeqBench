Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Dridex is spread via malicious documents attached to emails sent by spambots (Necurs, Cutwail, Andromeda).
   - **Execution:** The malware uses the OutputDebugStringW function as an anti-debug technique and is heavily obfuscated.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Dridex employs anti-debug techniques and obfuscation to evade detection, including the use of the OutputDebugStringW function and RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to communicate data such as computer name and botnet ID number with Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests after the malware has evaded detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. Since the question specifies encrypted POST requests, this is a strong candidate.
   - **T1622-Debugger Evasion:** This technique is about evading debuggers, which is already covered in the execution phase. It does not pertain to data exfiltration.
   - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data in non-standard ways, which is part of the obfuscation process but not specifically about communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations:** This technique is about determining the physical location of a target, which is not relevant to the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already evaded detection through obfuscation and anti-debug techniques.
   - The next step is to communicate with the C2 server, which involves sending data such as the computer name and botnet ID number.
   - The question specifies that this communication is done via encrypted POST requests, which aligns with the Application Layer Protocol (T1071).

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
