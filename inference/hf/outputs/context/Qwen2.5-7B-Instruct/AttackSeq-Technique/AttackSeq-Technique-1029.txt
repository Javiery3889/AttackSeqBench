Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), `rundll32`, `CreateProcess`, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and inserting malicious macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, code signing, deobfuscation, and use of valid certificates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents).
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after the backdoor automatically lists interesting files, a technique is used to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1596.002-WHOIS:** This technique involves querying WHOIS records to gather information about domain names. It does not fit the context of gathering documents from the local system.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting or removing controls that would prevent or detect malicious activity. It does not directly relate to gathering documents.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system, which aligns with the backdoor listing interesting files and then gathering those files.
   - **T1213.001-Confluence:** This technique involves using a Confluence server, which is a specific type of document management system. It does not fit the context of gathering documents from the local system and network shares.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor automatically lists interesting files, which are likely to be sensitive documents.
   - The next step would be to gather these files.
   - T1119-Automated Collection fits the context of automatically collecting data from the system, which aligns with the backdoor's function of listing and then gathering these files.

**Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection**
