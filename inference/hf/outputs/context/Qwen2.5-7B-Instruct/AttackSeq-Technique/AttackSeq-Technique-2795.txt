Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on already compromised systems, similar to SEDNIT malware.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is fully functional malware that runs in the background on iOS 7, hiding its icon and restarting automatically.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware collects information and sends it via HTTP POST and GET requests. It also uploads files via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to collect geo-location data from the device after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of geo-location data. However, it does describe the malware's behavior and communication methods.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or analysis. It does not directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules:** This technique involves using pluggable authentication modules to bypass authentication mechanisms. It is not related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the location of a system or user. This is the most relevant technique for collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the identity of the system owner or user. It is not related to collecting geo-location data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes the malware's behavior and communication methods but does not explicitly mention geo-location data collection.
   - Among the given options, T1614-System Location Discovery is the most relevant technique for collecting geo-location data, as it directly pertains to discovering the location of a system or user.

**Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
