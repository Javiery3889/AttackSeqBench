Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: ZoxPNG uses the PNG image file format for data transmission with the C2 server.
- **Defense Evasion**: ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication and sends a VictimSystemData structure in the HTTP Cookie header.
- **Others**: The communication pattern includes HTTP GET and POST requests with a PNG file containing instructions or data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when ZoxPNG established communication with the C2 server through HTTP requests with PNG files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to exfiltrate or transfer data. This does not match the described HTTP communication with PNG files.
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to establish a connection. ZoxPNG uses HTTP communication, which aligns with this technique.
- **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using network traffic to signal the presence of an attacker. While ZoxPNG uses HTTP and PNG files, this is more about the content of the traffic rather than signaling.
- **T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an SSH session. ZoxPNG does not use SSH, so this does not apply.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, which is a web service.
- The communication involves HTTP GET and POST requests with PNG files, which is a standard web service interaction.
- The use of HTTP and the transmission of data through PNG files are consistent with the T1102-Web Service technique.

### Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
