Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Use of anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with a C&C server.
7. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.
8. **Impact**: Capability to shut down the victim's computer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details for assessment during the discovery phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question mentions that the attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, which aligns with the "Discovery" phase in the CTI outline. The question is asking about the next step in the process, which is likely related to the data collected.

- **T1070.003-Clear Command History**: This technique involves clearing command history to avoid detection. This does not fit the context of the question, as it is not about what happens after data collection.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation from files or information. While this could be part of the process, it is not directly related to the data collection phase.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data. This fits the context of the question, as it is about what happens after the data is collected.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system. This is part of the discovery phase, not the next step after data collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers gathered detailed information about the victim's computer during the "Discovery" phase.
- The next logical step would be to archive or store this collected data for further analysis or exfiltration.
- Among the given options, **T1560-Archive Collected Data** is the most plausible technique that fits the context of the question.

### Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data
