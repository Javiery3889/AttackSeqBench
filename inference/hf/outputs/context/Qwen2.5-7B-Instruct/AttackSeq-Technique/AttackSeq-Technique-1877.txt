### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred earlier as part of their efforts to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration after the initial access via web shells.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1006-Direct Volume Access:** This technique involves accessing a volume on a storage device. It is not directly related to understanding the organizational structure or planning for infiltration.
   - **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains:** This technique involves searching for open websites or domains. While it could be part of reconnaissance, it is not specifically about understanding the victim's organizational structure.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique directly involves gathering information about the victim's organization, which aligns with the need to understand the organizational structure and plan for infiltration.
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing:** This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it can be used for reconnaissance, it is more about capturing data rather than understanding the organizational structure.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**. This technique directly aligns with the need to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
