Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Compromise via a watering hole attack using a VBScript engine vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174).
2. **Execution**: Multi-stage infection process, including downloading and running a DLL via PowerShell, checking for antivirus processes, and exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
3. **Persistence**: Achieving persistence by copying itself to ProgramData and creating a Run registry key with a typo.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Exiting if it detects antivirus software.
6. **Discovery**: Downloading and parsing a gist snippet from GitHub for commands and gathering system information (username and computer name).
7. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the attackers via Slack.
8. **Exfiltration**: Uploading files to file.io and posting download links to the Slack channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the SLUB backdoor was used to collect data from the victim's system. The key part of the question is "after performing discovery by retrieving a gist snippet from GitHub to parse commands and gathering system information."

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. The outline does not mention any credential theft or API hooking.
- **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning network protocols to steal credentials or data. The outline does not mention any network poisoning or relay attacks.
- **T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing or disabling security controls. The outline mentions defense evasion by exiting if it detects antivirus software, but this is not the same as impairing defenses.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. The outline does not mention any screen capture activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The outline clearly states that the SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading and parsing a gist snippet from GitHub to gather system information.
- After gathering system information, the next logical step would be to use the collected data for further actions, such as exfiltrating data or performing other malicious activities.
- The most plausible ATT&CK technique that fits this scenario is **T1113-Screen Capture**, as it involves using the collected data (system information) to capture and exfiltrate sensitive information from the victim's system.

### Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture
