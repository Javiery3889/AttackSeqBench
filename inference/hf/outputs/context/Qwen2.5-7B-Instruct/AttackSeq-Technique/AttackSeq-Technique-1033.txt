Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack involved a Trojan inserted into legitimate software 'Alpha' at its distribution point.
   - **Command and Control:** The Kingslayer backdoor used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2, and K2 had a different beaconing pattern.
   - **Others:** The Kingslayer backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code. The report mentions a Yara signature for detecting Kingslayer artifacts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a technique that occurred after the Kingslayer backdoor was loaded via the malicious 'Alpha' software subversion and before it evaded detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - The diurnal beacon sleep algorithm is a technique that changes the beaconing pattern to avoid detection, which is a form of evasive behavior.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1219-Remote Access Software:** This technique involves using remote access software, which is not directly related to the evasive behavior described.
   - **T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication:** This technique involves using domain controller authentication to gain access, which is not relevant to the evasive behavior described.
   - **T1027.014-Polymorphic Code:** This technique involves changing the code to avoid detection, which aligns with the description of the Kingslayer backdoor using a floating code that was undetected by antivirus.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to the evasive behavior described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the use of polymorphic code to evade detection before the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm was used.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**.

Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code
