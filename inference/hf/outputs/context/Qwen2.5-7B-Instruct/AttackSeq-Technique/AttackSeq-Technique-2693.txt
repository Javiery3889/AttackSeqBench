Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites.
- **Initial Access**: Exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
- **Execution**: Deployment of various custom and commodity malware.
- **Persistence**: Creation of scheduled tasks to execute malicious VBE files.
- **Credential Access**: Deployment of DarkComet to extract credentials.
- **Command and Control**: Use of POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools.
- **Exfiltration**: Use of custom .NET and AutoIt FTP tools for data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Elfin used PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging on infected systems for defense evasion and before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials from compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves the adversary actively scanning the network or system to gather information. It does not fit the context of bypassing logging or defense evasion.
- **T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging**: This technique involves the adversary using legitimate processes to hide malicious activities. This could be a plausible technique for bypassing logging and defense evasion.
- **T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves the adversary taking actions to reduce the effectiveness of security controls. This could also be a plausible technique for bypassing logging and defense evasion.
- **T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves the adversary exploiting weak file permissions on services to gain unauthorized access. This does not directly relate to bypassing logging or defense evasion.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- **Context**: The question specifies that the technique occurred after using PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging and before deploying DarkComet.
- **Process Doppelgänging (T1055.013)**: This technique involves using legitimate processes to hide malicious activities, which aligns with bypassing logging and defense evasion.
- **Impair Defenses (T1562)**: This technique involves reducing the effectiveness of security controls, which also aligns with bypassing logging and defense evasion.

### Final Answer
Both T1055.013 and T1562 could be plausible, but T1055.013 is more specific to the context of bypassing logging and defense evasion through process manipulation. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging
