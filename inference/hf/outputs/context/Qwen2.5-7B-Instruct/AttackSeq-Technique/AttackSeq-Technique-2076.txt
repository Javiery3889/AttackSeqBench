Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with a dropper.
   - **Execution:** Loader Trojan.Vcrodat uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs.
   - **Persistence:** Uses a remote shell and Termite for ongoing control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Exploits CVE-2016-0051 and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses search order hijacking and custom malware.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Compromises additional machines using stolen credentials.
   - **Collection:** Steals sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** Configures multiple C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates large volumes of information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurs after compromising additional machines using stolen credentials and before mapping the network and identifying further systems for infection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique is about stealing financial information, which is not directly related to the network mapping and identification of further systems.
   - **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery:** This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is more about identifying specific resources rather than the initial network mapping.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery:** This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the process of identifying further systems for infection after gaining access.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials, which is already covered by the stolen credentials step.

Given the context of the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the technique that directly follows the compromise of additional machines and precedes the detailed network mapping and identification of further systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
