Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - **Execution:** CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals various credentials and exports certificates.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer, and searches for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.
   - **Command and Control:** CosmicDuke communicates via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav.
   - **Exfiltration:** CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique follows persistence, specifically mentioning the search for specific file patterns, including non-English filenames.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard:** This technique is about interacting with cloud service dashboards, which is not relevant to searching for files.
   - **T1055.015-ListPlanting:** This technique involves creating or modifying files to plant indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to searching for files.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery:** This technique involves enumerating files and directories, which aligns with the description of CosmicDuke searching for specific file patterns.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique is about creating or modifying scheduled tasks, which is already covered by the persistence technique.

Given the context of CosmicDuke searching for specific file patterns, the most relevant ATT&CK technique is T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
