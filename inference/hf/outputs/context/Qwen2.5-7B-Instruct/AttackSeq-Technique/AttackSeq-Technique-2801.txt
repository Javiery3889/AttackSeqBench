To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - Initial Access: Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails.
   - Persistence: Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
   - Privilege Escalation: Hooks APIs, kills processes, changes file system paths, and registers a binary as the default handler for .MSC files.
   - Credential Access: Steals credentials from browsers and Outlook.
   - Discovery: Collects information about the victim's system.
   - Command and Control: Communicates with C&C server using RealThinClient SDK.

2. **Identify the Specific TTP:**
   - The question asks about a technique that Grandoreiro uses to evade detection by employing checks for debugging tools and virtual environments like VMWare and Virtual PC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070.004-File Deletion** - This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection. It does not match the context of checking for debugging tools and virtual environments.
   - **B: T1518-Software Discovery** - This technique involves identifying software and tools on the system. While it could be part of the discovery phase, it does not specifically address evasion by checking for debugging tools and virtual environments.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique involves detecting and avoiding execution in virtualized or sandboxed environments. This aligns with the context of checking for debugging tools and virtual environments.
   - **D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing** - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to hide malicious activity. It does not match the context of checking for debugging tools and virtual environments.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Grandoreiro employs various techniques to gain higher-level permissions and evade detection.
   - The specific technique of checking for debugging tools and virtual environments is a form of evasion, which is directly addressed by T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.

**Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
