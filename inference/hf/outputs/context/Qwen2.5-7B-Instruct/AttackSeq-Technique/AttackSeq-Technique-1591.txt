Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware sideloaded a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, into the legitimate igfxtray.exe.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry key modifications and DLL injection into explorer.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used various evasion techniques, including customizing installation to avoid detection and creating mutexes.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrated data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after T9000 established persistence and stole files from removable media.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1074-Data Staged:** This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration, which is not directly related to stealing files from removable media.
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves stealing data from removable media, which aligns with the CTI outline's description of exfiltrating files from removable drives.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using an encrypted channel for C2 communication, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of files from removable media.
   - **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into an image file, which is not related to stealing files from removable media.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that T9000 exfiltrated various types of data, including files from removable drives.
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred after persistence and stealing files from removable media.
   - T1025-Data from Removable Media directly matches the action of stealing files from removable media.

**Final Answer: B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
