Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG-3279 performs reconnaissance via open source research and network scanning.
   - **Resource Development:** TG-3279 reuses network infrastructure and domain names.
   - **Initial Access:** TG-3279 uses 's' for port scanning and 'rdp_crk' for RDP brute force.
   - **Persistence:** TG-3279 uses optionally loaded DLLs for Conpee plugin framework.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG-3279 installs tools by compromising admin credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG-3279 uses non-HTTPS traffic over port 443 for C2 communication, involving IP calculations and domain name parking.
   - **Credential Access:** TG-3279 accesses network and system administrators' accounts.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG-3279 uses Conpee or Etso tools as beachheads and adds scheduled tasks using compromised credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic after beachheads were established and scheduled tasks were added.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control. It does not match the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify active hosts and services. It does not match the C2 communication aspect.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. However, the question specifies port 443, which is a standard port.
   - **T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring infrastructure for C2 communication. While it is related to C2, it does not specifically address the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline and the question is the use of a non-standard protocol over a standard port (443) for C2 communication. The closest match is T1571-Non-Standard Port, even though it does not explicitly mention non-HTTPS traffic, it is the most relevant in the context of using a standard port for non-standard communication.

Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
