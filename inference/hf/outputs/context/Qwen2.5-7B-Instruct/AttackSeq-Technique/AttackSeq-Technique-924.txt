### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan and injection of a web shell.
   - **Initial Access:** Targeting web servers, both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan with main executable and DLL components.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hiding from detection tools and merging into the environment.
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging to gain admin passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Manual spread via pivoting and USB infection.
   - **Command and Control:** Multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime.
   - The question asks about maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots under specific paths.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question focuses on maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots, which implies persistence.
   - The answer choices are related to different persistence techniques.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence.
     - It does not directly address the loading of a DLL or the specific paths mentioned.
   - **B: T1110-Brute Force**
     - This technique involves brute-forcing authentication mechanisms, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared modules to maintain persistence.
     - It aligns with the idea of dynamically loading a DLL, which is a shared module.
   - **D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
     - This technique involves using the .NET AppDomainManager to maintain persistence.
     - It is specific to .NET environments and does not directly address the loading of a DLL.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline and the specific paths mentioned is **T1129-Shared Modules**. This technique involves using shared modules (DLLs) to maintain persistence, which fits the context of the Explosive Trojan dynamically loading a backend API DLL.

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
