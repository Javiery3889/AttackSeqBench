Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** Execution of a sophisticated memory-resident malware (NodeIISWeb).
   - **Persistence:** Utilization of web shells and a custom malware framework that operates in-memory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Use of custom PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Interfering with logging mechanisms and evading commercial EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** Modifying login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** Deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling process to establish C2.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where compromised domain credentials are used to access shared folders, and a NodeIISWeb web shell loader is dropped via SMB to compromise additional servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves exploiting a legitimate system feature to gain elevated privileges. It does not fit the scenario of using SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM):** This technique involves using DCOM to execute code on a remote system. It is not directly related to the scenario of using SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate between systems. It is not relevant to the scenario of using SMB to drop a web shell.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system to gain access or perform actions. In this case, the threat actor uses SMB to drop a web shell, which is a form of exploiting a remote service.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the exploitation of a remote service (SMB) to drop a web shell, which aligns with the T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
