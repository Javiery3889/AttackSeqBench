Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT Sidewinder used an RTF document with CVE-2017-11882 to download an HTA file.
   - **Execution:** The HTA file checked for installed antivirus software using WMI and executed a backdoor if no antivirus was detected.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor established persistence by creating a registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and used VBS instead. The backdoor used DLL sideloading.
   - **Discovery:** The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the HTA file used WMI to check for installed antivirus software and then communicated with the C2 server.
   - The question is specifically about sending information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique is about using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic. It does not match the context of sending information about antivirus software.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the WMI check for antivirus software.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. While it could be used for communication, it does not specifically address the discovery of antivirus software.
   - **D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity** - This technique involves using multiple identities to evade detection. It does not match the context of sending information about antivirus software.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The CTI outline clearly states that the HTA file used WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
- The question asks about sending information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server.
- T1082-System Information Discovery (B) is the most relevant technique as it involves gathering system information, which includes checking for installed antivirus software.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
