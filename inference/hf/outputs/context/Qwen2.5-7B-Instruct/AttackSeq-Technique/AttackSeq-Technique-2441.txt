Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Phishing campaigns were used to deliver malware.
- **Execution**: Various methods were used to execute the malware, including side-loading malicious DLLs and deploying custom stagers, meterpreter-based shellcode downloaders, and reverse shells.
- **Persistence**: Techniques included using benign executables to load malicious DLLs, stagers, and reverse shells to maintain access. Scheduled tasks and registry modifications were also used for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control (C2) operations, before fetching additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for C2 communications. It does not directly relate to deploying the PlugX implant.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to run at a later time. This could be used for persistence but not necessarily for deploying the PlugX implant.
- **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools laterally within a network. It does not directly relate to deploying the PlugX implant.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. This is more relevant to the initial deployment of the malware, which includes the PlugX implant.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that Mustang Panda used benign executables to load malicious DLLs, which activated the PlugX RAT implant. This indicates that the initial deployment of the PlugX implant likely involved a method to load the DLL, which could be a form of ingress tool transfer.
- The question specifically asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant during C2 operations, which aligns more closely with the initial deployment of the malware rather than lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

Given the context and the specific mention of benign executables loading malicious DLLs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
