Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with phishing documents containing malicious macros.
   - **Execution:** The macros released a backdoor program that was written in C#.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor program checked for parameters and performed checks to avoid detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor program used evasion techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor program gathered host information.
   - **Communication:** The backdoor program used complex DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that establishes communication with the C2 server after the backdoor program has gathered host information.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a C2 channel. DNS tunneling is a form of application layer protocol, so this could be a strong candidate.
   - **T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves using local accounts to maintain access. This does not align with the question about communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. This is more about executing commands locally rather than establishing a C2 channel.
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to establish a C2 channel. DNS tunneling can also be considered a form of web service communication, but it is more specific to DNS.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the backdoor program used complex DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it encompasses the use of DNS tunneling.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
