Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack used PowerShell to execute Shellcode scripts and a binary file named Sample A to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attack involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities and executing them in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attack could move laterally within the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for APT-TOCS to establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs after downloading Shellcode script functionalities and maintaining multi-beacon communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions HTTP GET requests, which are a form of network communication.
   - The context of the question is about secure communication, which aligns with the use of encrypted channels or command and scripting interpreters to maintain persistence and evade detection.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1654-Log Enumeration** - This technique involves enumerating logs to exfiltrate data. It does not fit the context of establishing secure communication.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it is related to execution, it does not specifically address secure communication.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to secure communications. It is a plausible choice for establishing secure communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to secure communications. It is also a plausible choice for establishing secure communication.

Given the context of the question, the most relevant ATT&CK technique for establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests would be one that directly addresses the secure channel aspect. Both T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography and T1573-Encrypted Channel are plausible, but T1573-Encrypted Channel is more directly related to the establishment of an encrypted channel, which is the focus of the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
