To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline, let's break down the attack sequence and match it with the provided answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: ChromeLoader is mentioned as a technique that spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension.
- **Persistence**: Operation In(ter)ception installs a LaunchAgent for persistence in the user's local folder.
- **Defense Evasion**: Operation In(ter)ception uses lures and masquerades as legitimate processes for evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks for a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ChromeLoader installed a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic.
2. Operation In(ter)ception served as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **ChromeLoader**: The CTI outline mentions that ChromeLoader installs a Chrome browser extension capable of stealing information and serving adware. This implies that ChromeLoader is likely to have installed a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic.
- **Operation In(ter)ception**: The CTI outline states that Operation In(ter)ception targets Coinbase and Crypto.com users with lures of job offers and drops multi-stage macOS malware. It also mentions that it serves as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

### Step 4: Match the TTPs
- **T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique involves the use of Active Setup to persistently install software. This does not fit the context of ChromeLoader or Operation In(ter)ception.
- **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves the use of an external proxy to route traffic. While it could be used for interception, it is not directly mentioned in the context of ChromeLoader or Operation In(ter)ception.
- **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware. This does not fit the context of ChromeLoader or Operation In(ter)ception.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves the transfer of tools from an external system to the target. This fits the context of Operation In(ter)ception serving as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

### Step 5: Final Answer
Given the context and the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that ChromeLoader installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic, and then Operation In(ter)ception serves as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2. The TTP that best fits the second part of the sequence (downloading a fourth stage from a C2) is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
