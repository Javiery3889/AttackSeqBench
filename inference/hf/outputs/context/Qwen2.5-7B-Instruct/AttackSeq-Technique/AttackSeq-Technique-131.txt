To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** Downloaded Shellcode script functionalities and executed in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, multi-beacon communication, and use of Cookie fields for heartbeat packages.
   - **Command and Control:** Used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control, communicating via HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Network projection for lateral movement within the internal network.
   - **Others:** Related to Cobalt Strike, capable of penetrating firewalls, and using multi-beacon communication to evade sandbox detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access technique that allowed attackers to establish initial access before executing Shellcode scripts in memory for network communication via Beacon mode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts:** This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access to systems. It is a common method for establishing initial access, especially in targeted attacks.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it can be used for initial access, it is not as directly related to the network communication and execution in memory as the other options.
   - **T1559-Inter-Process Communication:** This technique involves using inter-process communication to move laterally within a network. It is not directly related to the initial access but rather to the lateral movement.
   - **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness:** This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in services registry entries to gain access. While it can be used for initial access, it is not as commonly associated with the network communication and execution in memory as the other options.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that APT-TOCS uses multi-beacon communication and runs in memory, which suggests a targeted and stealthy approach.
   - The initial access technique should be something that allows the attackers to gain a foothold in the network and then proceed with the execution of Shellcode scripts.
   - **T1078.002-Domain Accounts** is a common and effective method for establishing initial access, especially in targeted attacks where domain accounts are often misused.

**Final Answer: A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
