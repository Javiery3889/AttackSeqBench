Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Turla's PowerShell scripts are designed to evade detection by encrypting payloads and obfuscating scripts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the execution of PowerShell to run malware in memory.
   - The next step is the evasion of detection, which involves encrypting the payloads.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred after Turla leveraged PowerShell to run malware directly in memory and before encrypting payloads to evade detection.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1546-Event Triggered Execution** - This technique involves triggering the execution of a malicious payload based on an event. It does not directly relate to the execution of PowerShell in memory or the encryption of payloads.
   - **B: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure** - This technique involves modifying cloud-based infrastructure, which is not relevant to the described attack sequence.
   - **C: T1137-Office Application Startup** - This technique involves using the startup of an Office application to execute a malicious payload. While it involves execution, it does not directly relate to the PowerShell in-memory execution or the encryption of payloads.
   - **D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery** - This technique involves discovering and using peripheral devices, such as USB drives, to execute malicious code. This could be relevant as Turla's RPC backdoor and PowerStallion can monitor USB drives, but it does not directly fit the sequence of execution and evasion.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is the execution of PowerShell in memory followed by the encryption of payloads to evade detection. The technique that fits this sequence is not explicitly listed in the provided choices, but the closest and most relevant one is **T1137-Office Application Startup**, as it involves execution and could be part of the broader attack strategy.

**Final Answer: C: T1137-Office Application Startup**
