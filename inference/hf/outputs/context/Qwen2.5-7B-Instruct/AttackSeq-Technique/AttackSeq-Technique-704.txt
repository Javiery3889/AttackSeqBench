Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** TA505 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U software (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TA505 modified the registry to ensure the hijacked RegIdleBackup scheduled task executed the FlawedGrace RAT loader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when TA505 maintained access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that TA505 modified the registry to ensure the hijacked RegIdleBackup scheduled task executed the FlawedGrace RAT loader. This indicates that TA505 used a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK technique that corresponds to using a scheduled task to maintain access is T1053.005, which is "Scheduled Task/Job."

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct answer is C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
