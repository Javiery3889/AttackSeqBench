Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious emails with weaponized RTF documents.
   - **Execution:** MSIL/Crimson malware is executed, which is a downloader that downloads a more fully featured RAT.
   - **TTPs:** The MSIL/Crimson malware family is modular, with the first stage being a downloader that downloads the full RAT. The RAT has data exfiltration functions and supports various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that follows the execution of the full RAT after it has been downloaded from the specified host.
   - The RAT communicates with custom TCP protocol to its servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (A):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining long-term presence on a network. While the RAT might use persistence mechanisms, the question specifically mentions communication with a server.
   - **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves stealing data from the target. While the RAT likely has data exfiltration capabilities, the question focuses on the communication aspect.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves the attacker controlling the compromised system. The communication with the server using a custom TCP protocol fits this description.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running code on the target system. The execution of the RAT has already occurred, so this is not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The MSIL/Crimson malware downloads the full RAT.
   - The full RAT then communicates with its command and control server using a custom TCP protocol.
   - This communication is a critical step in the attacker's control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
