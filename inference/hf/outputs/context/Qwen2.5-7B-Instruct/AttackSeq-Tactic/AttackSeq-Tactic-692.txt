Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with phishing documents containing malicious macros.
   - **Execution:** The macros released a backdoor program that was written in C#.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor program checked for parameters and wrote startup items.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor program performed checks to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor program gathered host information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor program used DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that established communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling after the backdoor program gathered host information and executed evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor program used DNS tunneling for communication with the C2 server, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - The question specifies that this occurred after the backdoor program gathered host information and executed evasion techniques, which aligns with the sequence of events in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct answer is the ATT&CK tactic that involves establishing communication with the C2 server, which is Command and Control (C2).
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best fits the sequence of TTPs is D: Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
