Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with the distribution of LURK malware through socially engineered emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware connects to a command-and-control server at dtl.dnsd.me:63 and uses a backup domain if the primary server is inaccessible.
   - **Persistence:** The malware creates a link in the Startup folder and additional files in %AppData% to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The use of password-protected Office documents to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that facilitated communication with dynamic DNS-associated domains like dtl.dnsd.me:63 after persistence was established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the malware connects to a command-and-control server at dtl.dnsd.me:63, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.
   - The persistence tactics (creating a link in the Startup folder and additional files in %AppData%) are meant to ensure the malware remains on the system, but they do not directly facilitate communication with the C2 server.
   - Exfiltration is not mentioned in the context of communication with the C2 server.
   - Defense Evasion is about techniques to avoid detection, not about establishing or maintaining communication with a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The tactic that most likely facilitated communication with the dynamic DNS-associated domains like dtl.dnsd.me:63 is Command and Control (C2).

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
