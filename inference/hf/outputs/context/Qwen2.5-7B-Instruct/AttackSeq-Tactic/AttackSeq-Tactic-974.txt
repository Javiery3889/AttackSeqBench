Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader to execute the malware.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns.
6. **Collection**: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
7. **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke exfiltrates the collected data via FTP and WebDav servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers after the collection phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This TTP involves the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server. It is common for malware to use HTTP GET requests to communicate with remote servers.
- **Lateral Movement**: This TTP involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. It does not directly relate to exfiltration.
- **Execution**: This TTP involves the execution of the malware. It does not directly relate to exfiltration.
- **Collection**: This TTP involves gathering data. It does not directly relate to the communication and exfiltration of data.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The question specifies that the TTP enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers. This aligns most closely with the **Command and Control (C2)** TTP, as it involves the communication and exfiltration of data to remote servers.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
