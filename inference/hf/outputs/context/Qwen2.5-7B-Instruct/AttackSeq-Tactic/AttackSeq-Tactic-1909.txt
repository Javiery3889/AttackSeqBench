Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spearphishing to obtain retail staff passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** Malicious scripts were injected into checkout pages to intercept transactions and send the data to a controlled collection server.
   - **Others:** The skimming activity is linked to HIDDEN COBRA, and the operations have been ongoing since May 2019.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where after intercepting customer keystrokes and sending transaction data to a controlled collection server, the next step involves funnelling stolen assets through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exfiltration of stolen assets. However, the context of sending transaction data to a controlled collection server strongly suggests that the next step would be to exfiltrate the stolen data.
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This is the process of transferring data from the compromised system to an external location, which aligns with the scenario of sending transaction data to a controlled collection server.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the compromised system, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data, which is already covered by the interception and sending of transaction data.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which is also not directly mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the exfiltration of the stolen data to a controlled collection server.
   - Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
