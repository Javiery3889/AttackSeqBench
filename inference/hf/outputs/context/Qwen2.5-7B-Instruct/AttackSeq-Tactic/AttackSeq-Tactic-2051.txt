Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on iOS devices, similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs in the background, collects various types of data, and can restart automatically.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involves sending collected data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker after the data has been collected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline describes the malware's actions in detail, including data collection. However, it does not explicitly mention sending the data out or receiving commands.
   - The question is asking about a specific ATT&CK tactic that involves communication with the attacker.
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to be used in future attacks. While the malware collects data, this does not directly address sending the data out or receiving commands.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves the attacker sending commands to the compromised system and receiving data from it. This aligns with the question's requirement of sending data out via HTTP and receiving commands.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves developing and maintaining resources for the attacker, which is not directly related to the question.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves identifying and classifying the target network or system. While the malware does discover information, this does not address the communication aspect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware collects various types of data, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the tactic that involves sending the data out and receiving commands, which is a clear indication of Command and Control.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the sending of data or receiving commands, but the context of the question strongly suggests that the malware is communicating with the attacker.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
