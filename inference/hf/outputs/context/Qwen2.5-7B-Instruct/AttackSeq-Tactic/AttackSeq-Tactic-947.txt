Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The MuddyWater campaign uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro to deliver a backdoor payload.
   - **Execution:** The macro triggers the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerShell script drops various components into a specific directory and uses these components to run the final payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The campaign uses obfuscation methods for the macro scripts.
   - **Others:** The campaign communicates with a C2 server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) to send and receive further commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the PRB-Backdoor began communicating with the C2 server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (A):** This tactic is about avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. While the outline mentions obfuscation, it does not directly state that the backdoor is communicating with the C2 server as part of defense evasion.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure. The outline clearly states that the PRB-Backdoor communicates with the C2 server to send and receive further commands.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C):** This tactic is about gaining higher-level access on the system. The outline does not mention any actions related to privilege escalation.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. The outline describes the initial access method but does not mention the communication with the C2 server as part of initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The PRB-Backdoor is a payload that is dropped and executed as part of the persistence mechanism.
   - The communication with the C2 server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) is a critical function of the backdoor, allowing it to receive further commands and updates.
   - This communication is a core function of the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which is specifically about the interaction between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
