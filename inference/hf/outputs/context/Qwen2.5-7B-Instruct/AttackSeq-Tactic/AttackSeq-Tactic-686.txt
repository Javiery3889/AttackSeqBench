Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan and injection of a web shell.
   - **Initial Access:** Targeting publicly facing web servers and manual/automated vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan with main executable and DLL components.
   - **Persistence:** Installation of Explosive Trojan with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hiding from detection and custom configurations.
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Use of initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread across the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network. This action is described under the **Lateral Movement** tactic.
   - The question is asking what tactic occurred after this manual spread, which implies the next step in the attack sequence.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This is the initial step, not what occurs after the manual spread.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This is the tactic that describes the manual spread, but the question asks what occurs after this.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This could be a plausible next step as the attackers would need to establish a command and control channel to manage the spread.
   - **D: Execution** - This is the tactic for running the Explosive Trojan, but it does not fit the sequence after the manual spread.

Given the context and the sequence of events described in the CTI outline, the most plausible next step after the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread across the network would be establishing a command and control channel to manage the spread.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
