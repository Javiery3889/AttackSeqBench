Let's follow the steps to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the execution of various malicious plugins by the BlackEnergy2 (BE2) group, targeting Windows systems. The key plugins mentioned are:
- 'dstr.dll' for data destruction
- 'grc.dll' for creating a backup communication channel via Google Plus
- 'usb.dll' for collecting information on USB drives
- 'bs.dll' for gathering system information

The 'bs.dll' plugin specifically collects BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS information using WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic involved detailed gathering of system information such as BIOS, motherboard, and OS details before performing impactful actions. The answer choices are:
A: Impact
B: Persistence
C: Discovery
D: Reconnaissance

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data destruction or data exfiltration. The 'dstr.dll' plugin is an example of this tactic.
- **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. The 'grc.dll' plugin, which creates a backup communication channel, is an example of this tactic.
- **Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the target system. The 'usb.dll' plugin, which collects information on USB drives, could be considered under this tactic.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target system to better understand and exploit it. The 'bs.dll' plugin, which collects BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS information, is a clear example of this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'bs.dll' plugin is explicitly described as gathering detailed system information such as BIOS, motherboard, and OS details.
- This information gathering is a critical step before any impactful actions can be taken, aligning with the ATT&CK tactic of Reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
