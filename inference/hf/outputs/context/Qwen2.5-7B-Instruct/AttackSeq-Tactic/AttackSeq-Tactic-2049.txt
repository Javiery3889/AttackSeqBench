Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects various types of information from the iOS device.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware sends collected information to a C&C server and can also upload files via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The malware is installed on compromised systems, which aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - The malware then starts collecting information, which aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.
   - The **Command and Control** tactic involves the malware sending collected information to a C&C server, which happens after the information is gathered.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline is:
     1. Initial Access (installation of the malware)
     2. Discovery (gathering of information)
     3. Command and Control (sending information to C&C server)

5. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves the running of code, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the development of resources, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the malware sending information to a C&C server, which happens after the information is gathered.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the malware collecting information, which happens after the malware is installed.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is that after the malware is installed (Initial Access), it proceeds to gather information (Discovery), and then sends the information to a C&C server (Command and Control).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
