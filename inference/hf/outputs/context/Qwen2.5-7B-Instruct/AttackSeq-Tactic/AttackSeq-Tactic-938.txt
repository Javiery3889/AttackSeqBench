Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which then dropped and executed other files like sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted configuration file. UserInstall.exe used the BITSadmin command-line tool to launch sidebar.exe.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor decrypts its configuration and connects to a C&C server using SSL.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
   - **Command and Control:** TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server, and the C&C server is not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute commands and install an MSI package on the system.
   - The exploit of the CVEs would be considered Initial Access, as it is the first step in the attack where the threat actor gains a foothold in the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step where the threat actor gains access to the target system. The exploitation of the CVEs fits this description.
   - **Execution (B):** This is the step where the threat actor runs code or a script on the target system. The installation of the MSI package and subsequent execution of the backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) fits this description.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This is the step where the threat actor obtains credentials. There is no mention of credential access in the CTI outline.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This is the step where the threat actor develops and maintains resources for the attack. This is more related to the persistence and maintenance phase, not the initial access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The exploitation of the CVEs to execute commands and install an MSI package is the Initial Access step, which is the first step in the attack lifecycle.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access.

Final Answer: A: Initial Access
