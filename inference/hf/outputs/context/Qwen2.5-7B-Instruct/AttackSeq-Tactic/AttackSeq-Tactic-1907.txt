Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Command and Control**: HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactions.
2. **Exfiltration**: HIDDEN COBRA uses a global exfiltration network to send stolen data to a collection server and then to the dark web.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after HIDDEN COBRA used spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords to break into online stores. This implies that the spearphishing attack is the initial access, and we need to determine the next step in the attack sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This is the first step in the attack, which is the spearphishing attack to obtain retail staff passwords.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network or system. However, the outline does not mention any persistence mechanisms after the initial access.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the capability to control a victim's system. The outline mentions that HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into store checkout pages, which is a form of command and control.
- **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the victim's system. The outline mentions that the stolen data is sent to a collection server and then to the dark web, which is exfiltration.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the spearphishing attack is the initial access.
2. **Next TTP**: After obtaining the retail staff passwords, the next step would be to use those credentials to break into the online stores. This action aligns with the Command and Control tactic, as the attacker would need to control the compromised systems to inject the malicious scripts.
3. **Exfiltration**: After the Command and Control phase, the stolen data is exfiltrated to the collection server and then to the dark web.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access (spearphishing) is Command and Control, followed by Exfiltration.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
