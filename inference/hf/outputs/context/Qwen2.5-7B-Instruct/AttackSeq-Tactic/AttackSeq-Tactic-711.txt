Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of events:
1. Execution of malicious JavaScript and Windows executable files (05sall.js, module.avi.exe, etc.).
2. Download and installation of malware (Trojan.JS.Nodster.A, Trojan.JS.WINDIVERT.B, and Trojan.Win32.Novter.A).

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after the execution of the malicious files and the installation of the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which of the given answer choices (Lateral Movement, Discovery, Execution, Command and Control) is the most plausible next step after the malware has been installed.

- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. It is a step that might occur after the malware has been installed and is operational.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary discovering information about the network and systems. It is a common step after initial access and malware installation.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running code on the target system. Since the malware has already been installed, this step has already occurred.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel to exfiltrate data or control the compromised system. It is a step that might occur after the malware is installed and operational.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The CTI outline clearly states that the execution of malicious files leads to the download and installation of malware.
2. After the malware is installed, the next logical step would be for the adversary to discover the environment and possibly move laterally to other systems.
3. Command and Control is a step that might occur later, but it is not the immediate next step after installation.
4. Execution has already occurred, so it is not the next step.

Given the context and the typical sequence of steps in a cyber attack, the most plausible next step after the malware is installed would be to discover the environment and possibly move laterally.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
