Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script is executed, which decodes and executes another base64 encoded PowerShell script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The script uses image files to conceal its components and signs the final payload with valid certificates.
   - **Command and Control:** The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of Internet Explorer and communicates with the C&C server using AES encryption.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the use of malicious Microsoft Word documents to deliver encrypted script data and initiate the Bandook payload.
   - The key here is to identify the sequence of TTPs and determine which tactic follows the execution of the initial payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The initial payload is delivered via a malicious Word document, which is a form of **Initial Access**.
   - After the initial access, the script is executed, which is part of the **Execution** tactic.
   - The next step in the sequence, based on the CTI outline, is the use of image files to conceal the payload and sign it with valid certificates, which is part of **Defense Evasion**.
   - The final step mentioned is the use of Process Hollowing to inject the payload into Internet Explorer, which is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.

Given the sequence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access (delivery of the payload via Word document) would be:
1. Execution (decoding and executing the script)
2. Defense Evasion (concealing the payload and signing it)
3. Command and Control (injecting the payload into Internet Explorer)

The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurs after the initial access, which is the execution of the payload.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
