Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Spear-phishing emails are sent to targets.
2. **Initial Access**: The Taidoor malware is delivered via email attachments and exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
3. **Execution**: The malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts and changes its network traffic pattern to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to maintain communication with servers such as roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw after the malware has evaded detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with servers.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic is about evading detection, which is already mentioned in the outline. The question asks about maintaining communication, not evasion.
- **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves gathering data, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with servers.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing, operating, and maintaining the CnC infrastructure to control the compromised systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware uses a consistent HTTP GET request pattern to beacon to a CnC server. This is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- The question specifically asks about maintaining communication with servers, which aligns with the C2 tactic.
- The other tactics (Credential Access, Defense Evasion, and Collection) do not directly relate to the maintenance of communication with servers.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
