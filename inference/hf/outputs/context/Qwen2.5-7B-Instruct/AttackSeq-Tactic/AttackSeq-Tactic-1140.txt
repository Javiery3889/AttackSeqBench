Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** ChChes uses HTTP cookie headers for C&C communication and employs a specific code signing certificate.
   - **Command and Control:** ChChes communicates with C&C servers to receive commands and modules, using encrypted data.
   - **Others:** ChChes has been active since October 2016, and JPCERT/CC is monitoring it for targeted attacks.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved the use of targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables before ChChes established communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the actor gaining access to the target's network or system. The use of targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables is a common method for initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While ChChes does use defense evasion techniques, the question is specifically about the initial step of gaining access.
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves the development of tools, resources, and procedures. It does not directly relate to the initial access method.
   - **Impact:** This tactic involves the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration or system damage. It is not relevant to the initial access method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of targeted emails with ZIP file attachments, but it does describe ChChes as a new type of malware used in targeted attacks.
   - The question is asking about the initial step, which is most likely to be Initial Access, as it involves the method of gaining initial access to the target's system.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
