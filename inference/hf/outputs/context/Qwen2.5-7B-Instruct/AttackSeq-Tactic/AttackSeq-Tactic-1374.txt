Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 maps victim networks, captures credentials, and steals sensitive documents.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses common techniques like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FIN13 uses passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses LSASS process memory dumping and network sniffing for credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** FIN13 uses proxies and application layer protocols for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - The key phrase here is "gathered information on network and host configurations," which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target network and host configurations, which is consistent with the CTI outline mentioning that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials.
   - **Command and Control (A):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels to and from the target network, which comes later in the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources, which is a subset of Reconnaissance.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which is mentioned in the CTI outline but comes after the initial reconnaissance phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Reconnaissance (C) occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
