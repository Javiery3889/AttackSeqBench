Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn used a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** Longhorn configures specific domain and IP address combinations for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
   - **Exfiltration:** Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Longhorn gained initial access through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document and before the group conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (CTI Outline):** This is the first step where Longhorn gained access to the target system.
   - **Discovery (CTI Outline):** This is the step where Longhorn conducts detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.
   - **Privilege Escalation (TTP):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access privileges on the target system, which typically occurs after initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion (TTP):** This tactic involves avoiding detection by the target's security measures, which can occur at various stages but is not directly related to the sequence of gaining access and conducting detailed system operations.
   - **Initial Access (Answer Choice C):** This is the tactic that describes the method of gaining access, which is the first step and does not fit the criteria of occurring after initial access.
   - **Discovery (Answer Choice D):** This is the tactic that describes the detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations, which is the step after initial access.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the next step would be to conduct detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
