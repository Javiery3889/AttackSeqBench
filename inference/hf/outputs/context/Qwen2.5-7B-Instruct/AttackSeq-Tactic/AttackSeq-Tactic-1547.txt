Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
- **Execution**: Weaponized RTF files using RoyalRoad to exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
- **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to run a DLL.
- **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses.
- **Collection**: Backdoor collecting a wide range of data from the victim's system.
- **Command and Control**: Communication with a C&C server.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.
- **Impact**: Capability to shut down the victim's computer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attackers established persistence through a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' and before they gathered detailed system information from the victim's machine.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The scheduled task 'Windows Update' is explicitly mentioned as a persistence mechanism.
- **Discovery**: The detailed system information gathering (hostname, OS version, etc.) is the next step after persistence.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The scheduled task 'Windows Update' is a persistence mechanism, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.
- The detailed system information gathering (hostname, OS version, etc.) is the next step after establishing persistence, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is the tactic that occurs immediately after persistence and before detailed system information is gathered. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: Discovery
