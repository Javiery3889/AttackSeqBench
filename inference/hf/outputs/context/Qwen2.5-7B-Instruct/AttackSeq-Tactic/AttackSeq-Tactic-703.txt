Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits.
- **Command and Control**: The attack chain included four additional malware modules: Stager, Dropper, Service, and Remote shell. The Stager notified of successful exploitation, downloaded, and executed the Dropper module from a remote server. The Dropper installed two executables, one of which was used as a launcher for the Remote shell, which acted as the main payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the attackers utilized CVE-2021-31956 and CVE-2021-31955 to escape the sandbox and inject malware into a system process. The TTPs mentioned are:
- Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities (Initial Access)
- Escaping the sandbox (Privilege Escalation)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. There is no mention of data collection in the CTI outline.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target system. The CTI outline mentions the Command and Control phase, but it does not directly state that this is the phase before Privilege Escalation.
- **Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. There is no mention of impact in the CTI outline.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access privileges. The CTI outline states that the EoP exploit was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges, which aligns with the Privilege Escalation tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system.
- After gaining initial access, the attackers used an EoP exploit to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges.
- The question asks about the tactic that occurred before the attackers utilized the EoP exploit to escape the sandbox. Based on the CTI outline, the Command and Control phase is the phase that follows initial access and precedes the use of the EoP exploit.

### Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation
The correct answer is D: Privilege Escalation, as it is the tactic that directly follows the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities (Initial Access) and precedes the use of the EoP exploit to escape the sandbox.
