Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The adversaries use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information.
- **Initial Access**: The adversaries use spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and watering hole attacks with a website that downloads a malicious PowerPoint document.
- **Execution**: The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware.
- **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
- **Credential Access**: The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals and uses resilient communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurs after the backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and before the stolen files with specific extensions are uploaded to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information, which has already occurred through the initial access and execution phases.
- **Credential Access**: This tactic is about stealing credentials, which has already been mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which could logically follow the stealing of credentials to understand the environment better.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which would logically follow the discovery of valuable information and the stealing of credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials, which is a form of Credential Access.
- After stealing the credentials, the next logical step would be to understand the environment better, which is the purpose of the Discovery tactic.
- Once the environment is discovered, the adversaries would then collect specific files with extensions from the compromised system and upload them to the C2 server.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Discovery, which follows Credential Access and precedes the collection and upload of stolen files.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
