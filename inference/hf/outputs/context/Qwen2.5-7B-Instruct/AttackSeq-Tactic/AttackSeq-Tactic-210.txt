Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key attack sequence:
1. **Initial Access**: Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
2. **Execution**: The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
4. **Credential Access**: Steals user credentials.
5. **Collection**: Collects files and uploads them to the C2 server.
6. **Command and Control**: Pings the C2 server and uses resilient communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Dropping Elephant gained initial access to high-profile targets, with a focus on gathering information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This is the first step in the attack sequence, where Dropping Elephant gains access to the target network through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
- **Impact (B)**: This is a later stage where the impact of the attack is realized, which is not relevant to the initial phase of gathering information.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying the target and its vulnerabilities, which is a preparatory step but not the initial access.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to better understand the environment and plan the attack. This is a critical preparatory step before gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is gained through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
- The question asks about the tactic that occurred before gaining initial access, with a focus on gathering information.
- Reconnaissance (D) is the most appropriate answer because it involves the attacker gathering information about the target, which is a preparatory step before the initial access phase.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
