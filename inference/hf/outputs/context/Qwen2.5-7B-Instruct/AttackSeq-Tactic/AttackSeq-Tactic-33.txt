Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of events:
1. **Initial Access**: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic is mentioned in the outline but occurs after the initial access has been achieved.
- **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While not explicitly mentioned, it is a logical step before sending phishing emails.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It occurs after initial access and command and control.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic is explicitly mentioned in the outline as the first step, where the adversary gains access to the target systems via phishing emails.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the initial access via phishing emails.
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through phishing emails.
- The most logical step before sending phishing emails would be reconnaissance to gather information about the target systems and their defenses.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
