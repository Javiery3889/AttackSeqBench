Let's follow the steps to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing, phishing mass-mailing, and drive-by downloads.
- **Execution**: Downloading programs for remote, hidden administration to gain system administrators' credentials.
- **Defense Evasion**: Setting up malware within infrastructure software and reinstalling malware on internal sites.
- **Discovery**: Using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the network, which is before the execution phase.
- **Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources, which follows the execution phase where the cybercriminals have gained access and are now exploring the network.
- **Execution**: This tactic is about running code or commands on the target system, which is before the discovery phase.
- **Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, which would occur after the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the cybercriminals use remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore the financial systems of the targeted organization. This aligns with the **Discovery** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- After gaining access and credentials, the next logical step would be to explore the network and systems, which is the **Discovery** phase.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
