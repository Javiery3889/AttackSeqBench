Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Adversaries deliver and install BlackEnergy 3 on employee workstations.
- **Execution**: Employees enable macros, and the VBA script places malicious files on the workstation.
- **Credential Access**: Adversaries use the delivered malware to gather credentials and conduct network discovery.
- **Discovery**: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance to discover potential targets and expand access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic facilitated communication between the malware and an external server after the initial installation and before the credential harvesting and lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (T1078)**: This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, or exfiltrating data over a network to and from a command and control server. This is a critical step after the malware is installed and before any further actions like credential harvesting and lateral movement.
- **Discovery (T1033)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets. It occurs after the malware is installed and before credential harvesting.
- **Impact (T1486)**: This tactic involves causing harm to the victim's systems or data. It is not relevant to the communication phase.
- **Collection (T1033)**: This is a duplicate of Discovery and is not relevant to the communication phase.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: Malware is installed.
2. **Execution**: Malware is executed, and files are placed on the workstation.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware needs to communicate with an external server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is the critical step that occurs after the malware is installed and before any further actions like credential harvesting and lateral movement.

### Final Answer
The tactic that most likely facilitated communication between the malware and an external server is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
