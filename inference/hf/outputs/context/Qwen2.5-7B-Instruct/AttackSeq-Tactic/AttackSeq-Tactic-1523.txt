Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with a dropper.
   - **Execution:** Loader Trojan.Vcrodat uses search order hijacking.
   - **Persistence:** Uses a remote shell and Termite for ongoing control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Exploits CVE-2016-0051 and uses Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses search order hijacking and custom malware.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Maps the network and infects further computers.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Compromises additional machines using stolen credentials.
   - **Collection:** Steals sensitive information.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after network mapping and infecting further computers but before exfiltrating information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Mapping and Infection:** This aligns with the "Discovery" and "Lateral Movement" tactics.
   - **Exfiltration:** This is clearly the "Exfiltration" tactic.
   - The question is asking for the tactic that occurs between these two.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This typically involves maintaining control over the compromised systems, which happens after initial infection and before exfiltration.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This is about evading detection, which is a continuous process and not a specific step between network mapping and exfiltration.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This involves moving to other systems, which happens after initial infection and before exfiltration.
   - **D: Collection** - This involves gathering data, which happens after lateral movement and before exfiltration.

Given the sequence in the CTI outline, the step that occurs after network mapping and infecting further computers (Discovery and Lateral Movement) and before exfiltrating information (Collection) is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
