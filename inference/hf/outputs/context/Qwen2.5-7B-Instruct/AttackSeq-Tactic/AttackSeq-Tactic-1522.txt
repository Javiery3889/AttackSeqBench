Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails containing a dropper.
2. **Execution**: Loader Trojan.Vcrodat using search order hijacking.
3. **Persistence**: Deployment of tools like a remote shell and Termite.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability and using Mimikatz.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Using search order hijacking and custom malware.
6. **Credential Access**: Harvesting credentials using Mimikatz.
7. **Discovery**: Mapping the network and infecting further computers.
8. **Lateral Movement**: Compromising additional machines using stolen credentials.
9. **Command and Control**: Configuring multiple C&C domains.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating large volumes of information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement across the network to expand their control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development**: This tactic is about developing resources for the attacker, which does not fit the context of using stolen credentials for lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about avoiding detection, which is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network, which aligns with the use of stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which could be a result of the lateral movement but is not the immediate action after using stolen credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that after using stolen credentials for lateral movement, the group would be able to compromise additional machines and expand their control within the organization.
- The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs after using stolen credentials for lateral movement.
- The most logical and direct next step after compromising additional machines is to continue moving laterally within the network.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
