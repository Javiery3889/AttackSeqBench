Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** RTF document exploited a vulnerability to drop 'OSEA54d.tmp'.
   - **Execution:** 'OSEA54d.tmp' dropped 'GoogleUpdate.exe' (which is actually CertUtil.exe) and a .vbs script named 'Photo.vbs'.
   - **Persistence:** Two scheduled tasks were created: 'Google-Updates' and 'Google-Update'. The 'Google-Updates' task executed the downloaded payload every minute, and the 'Google-Update' task ran 'Photo.vbs' every two minutes.
   - **Command and Control:** Used an IP address to serve a second stage payload, but the payload was not retrieved.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the creation of the scheduled tasks 'Google-Updates' and 'Google-Update'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The scheduled tasks 'Google-Updates' and 'Google-Update' are directly related to maintaining persistence. The 'Google-Updates' task executes a downloaded payload every minute, and the 'Google-Update' task runs a script every two minutes. These actions ensure that the attackers can maintain access to the system even if the initial payload is removed or the system is rebooted.
   - **Defense Evasion (A):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defenders, which is not directly related to the scheduled tasks.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the target system. The scheduled tasks are a clear example of persistence.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** This tactic involves techniques to steal data from the target system, which is not directly related to the scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D):** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level access to the system, which is not directly related to the scheduled tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The scheduled tasks 'Google-Updates' and 'Google-Update' are directly related to maintaining access to the system, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.

Final Answer: B: Persistence
