Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with various file types (RAR, DOCX, DOCM, LNK, SFX) were used.
   - **Execution:** RTF and DOCX files with OLE objects and a malicious LNK file within a TAR archive were employed.
   - **Persistence:** A malicious PE file modified the registry RUN key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** A malicious VBScript was used, and the Telegram service was abused to obtain the real C2 IP address, bypassing DNS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the Armageddon Group used a malicious VBScript and abused the Telegram service to obtain the real C2 IP address, bypassing DNS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The malicious VBScript and abuse of Telegram to obtain the C2 IP address fall under the **Defense Evasion** tactic, as it involves evading detection and defense mechanisms.
   - The next step in the attack sequence, after obtaining the C2 IP address, would be to establish a connection with the C2 server, which is a part of the **Command and Control** (C2) tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline shows that after the Defense Evasion tactic, the next step would be to establish a connection with the C2 server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
