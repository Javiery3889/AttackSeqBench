Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The key points from the CTI outline are:
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via a malicious Word document.
2. **Execution**: The payload is moved to \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ and executed by injecting NavShExt.dll into iexplore.exe.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses various techniques to evade detection.
4. **Discovery**: The malware gathers system information.
5. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Elise malware moved its payload to the \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ directory and executed the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the target's information and resources. This occurs after the malware is executed and starts gathering information.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. This happens after the malware is executed and is communicating with the C2 server.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's systems over time. This is a longer-term goal and would follow the initial execution and discovery of information.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary avoiding or reducing the detection and disruption of their actions. This is a continuous process and would occur throughout the malware's lifecycle.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
After the Elise malware has moved its payload and executed it by injecting NavShExt.dll into iexplore.exe, the next logical step would be to gather information about the system, which is the purpose of the **Discovery** tactic. The malware would then use this information to establish and maintain a connection with the C2 server, which is the **Command and Control** tactic.

However, the question specifically asks which tactic most likely occurred **after** the execution and payload movement. Given the sequence of actions, the immediate next step after execution and payload movement would be to start gathering information about the system, which aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
