Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT. Key points include:
- **Resource Development**: The APT has a large, dynamic infrastructure.
- **Initial Access**: The APT targets hotel guests with malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
- **Persistence**: The APT maintains persistence on compromised systems.
- **Defense Evasion**: The APT uses various techniques to evade detection.
- **Credential Access**: The APT steals credentials from various browsers and email services.
- **Collection**: The APT collects and stores stolen data.
- **Command and Control**: The APT maintains a web interface for victim management.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay, before the APT gained initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development**: This tactic is about the infrastructure and resources the APT uses, not about obtaining information about victims.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which aligns with the need to know the names and places of stay of victims.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining entry to the target network, which happens after the reconnaissance phase.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised systems, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the tactic that involves obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the initial access phase.
- The CTI outline mentions that the APT targets top executives during their stay at certain hotels, indicating that they have detailed knowledge of their victims' travel plans.
- This detailed knowledge of victims' whereabouts is a form of reconnaissance, where the APT gathers information about potential targets before attempting to gain access.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
