Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The Naikon APT group used various methods, including weaponized RTF files and archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL.
2. **Execution**: The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
5. **Discovery**: The Aria-body backdoor gathered information from the victim's machine.
6. **Collection**: The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, and collect OS information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data after the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information and collected files, screenshots, and metadata.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: This TTP is about gathering data, which is already described in the CTI outline.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This TTP is about gaining higher-level access, which is not directly related to communication with the C&C server.
- **Discovery**: This TTP is about identifying and classifying resources, which is also already covered in the CTI outline.
- **Command and Control**: This TTP is about establishing and maintaining the ability to send commands to and receive data from the compromised system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information and collected files, screenshots, and metadata. This aligns with the **Collection** TTP.
- After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to facilitate communication with the C&C server to send the stolen data. This is directly related to the **Command and Control** TTP.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
