Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about potential targets.
2. **Initial Access**: Malicious documents were used to deliver the Sharpshooter downloader.
3. **Execution**: The macro in winword.exe downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
4. **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
5. **Command and Control**: The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred before the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
- After ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
- Which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests?

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we know that:
- **Persistence** (downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder) is a prerequisite for the **Command and Control** phase (communicating with control servers).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the persistence step has already occurred.
- The next step in the sequence, before the **Command and Control** phase, is the **Persistence** tactic itself.
- The **Command and Control** phase follows the persistence step.

Given the options:
- **A: Resource Development** - This is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **B: Command and Control** - This is the phase that occurs after persistence.
- **C: Persistence** - This is the phase that occurs before Command and Control.
- **D: Discovery** - This is the initial phase of reconnaissance, not the phase that occurs after persistence.

The correct answer is the TTP that occurs immediately before Command and Control, which is Persistence.

### Final Answer: C: Persistence
