Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of events:
1. **Initial Access**: Employees opened malicious documents (GD2020090939393903.doc and GD20200909GAB31.doc) containing job offers, which activated malicious macros.
2. **Execution**: The Lazarus Group executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of malicious code using system utilities and the CommsCacher backdoor after delivering malicious documents containing job offers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic is used to avoid detection and analysis. It does not fit the sequence as it is a later step.
- **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While it is a critical step, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence before the execution of malicious code.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target's network or system. The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved by opening malicious documents, which aligns with the sequence.
- **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target. While it is a step in the attack lifecycle, it is not directly mentioned as occurring before the execution of malicious code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly states that the initial access was achieved by opening malicious documents, which activated malicious macros.
- The execution of malicious code using system utilities and the CommsCacher backdoor follows the initial access.
- Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of malicious code is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
