Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use two vectors: compromising a public-facing web service and spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Credential Access:** After compromising a computer, they use tools like Mimikatz to collect passwords and obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** With domain administrator privileges, they can control the whole network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that after obtaining domain administrator privileges, the attackers use PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network.
   - PsExec and WinExe are tools used for remote execution and are typically associated with lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (A):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While it is a critical step, it does not directly describe the spread across the network.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic describes the initial entry into the network, which has already occurred in the CTI outline.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access, which is already covered by the CTI outline as the attackers have obtained domain administrator privileges.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. Given that the attackers use PsExec and WinExe to spread across the network, this is the most appropriate tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
