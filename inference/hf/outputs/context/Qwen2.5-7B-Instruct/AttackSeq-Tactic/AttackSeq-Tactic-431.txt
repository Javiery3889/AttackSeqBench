Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, and others were used for probing and compromising IP addresses.
   - **Initial Access:** Tools such as Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, PushVNC package, Fgdump, Dameware, VNC Password Recovery Tool, and xDedic RDP Patch were used to gain initial access to hosts and extract password hashes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that after gaining initial access, the attackers used batch files like AutoExe1.bat to delete traces of their activity and maintain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question clearly states that the batch files were used after initial access to delete traces and maintain access. This action aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic, which involves techniques to avoid detection and maintain access to the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The batch files used to delete traces of activity and maintain access are actions that fall under the **Defense Evasion** tactic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
