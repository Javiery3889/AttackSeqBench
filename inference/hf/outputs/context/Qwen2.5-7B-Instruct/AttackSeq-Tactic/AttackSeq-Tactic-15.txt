Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, or hijacking the clipboard as part of the persistence phase. However, these actions are part of the data collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when "Machete" started logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and hijacking the clipboard to gather information from target machines.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system, which includes actions like logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and hijacking the clipboard.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system, which is already covered by the persistence phase in the CTI outline.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is not directly related to the actions mentioned in the question.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment, which is more about the initial phase of the attack rather than the data collection phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline describes the initial access and persistence phases.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that involves logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and hijacking the clipboard, which are actions that fall under the Collection phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: A: Collection**
