Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** Used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning.
   - **Collection:** The SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign employed data collection methods using a custom storage file format but before data was exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The collection of data using a custom storage file format is clearly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The exfiltration of data over the C2 channel is also mentioned.
   - The question is asking for the tactic that occurred between these two steps.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This is the step that occurs after the data is collected and stored.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This is a broader term that could include discovery steps, but it is not specifically mentioned in the context of the data collection and storage.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This is related to the exfiltration and communication with the C2 server, which occurs after the data is collected.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This is not directly related to the data collection and storage process.

Given the sequence of events in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the data is collected and stored using a custom storage file format, the next step would be to prepare for exfiltration, which is closely related to the Command and Control (C2) process.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
