Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - **Execution:** Silent code execution via a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882 (T1204 - User Execution)
   - **Defense Evasion:** 
     - File Deletion (T1107 - File Deletion)
     - Hidden Files and Directories (T1158)
     - Software Packing (T1045)
   - **Collection:** Data from local system (T1005)
   - **Command and Control:** Data sent to a C2 server (T1043 - Commonly Used Port, T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol)
   - **Exfiltration:** Data encrypted and exfiltrated (T1002)

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that after the attacker deleted the original malicious file and used hidden directories, the malware targeted registry keys for stored passwords.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (T1005):** This tactic involves gathering data from the local system, which could include registry keys. However, the question specifically mentions targeting registry keys for stored passwords, which is a more specific action.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1107, T1158, T1045):** These tactics are about evading detection and defenses, which is already covered in the CTI outline.
   - **Credential Access (T1003):** This tactic involves stealing credentials, which can include passwords stored in registry keys. This aligns well with the question's mention of targeting registry keys for stored passwords.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1543):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access, which is not directly related to the specific action of targeting registry keys for stored passwords.

Given the context of the question and the specific mention of targeting registry keys for stored passwords, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is the Credential Access tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
