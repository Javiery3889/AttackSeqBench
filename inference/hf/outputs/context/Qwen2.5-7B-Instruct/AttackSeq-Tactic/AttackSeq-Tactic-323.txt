Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The rootkit is distributed via the RIG Exploit kit.
   - **Persistence:** The dropper extracts and saves the driver (houzi.sys) in the \Windows\Temp directory.
   - **Collection:** The driver gathers browsing data.
   - **Command and Control:** The driver connects to C&C domains to download homepage configurations.
   - **Others:** The rootkit includes methods to evade detection by creating a registry key to hide from 360Safe.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the driver employed tricks to hide from security products during startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the rootkit sets a registry key to hide from 360Safe, which is a security product.
   - The tactic of hiding from security products is best described by the **Defense Evasion** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct answer is the one that aligns with the tactic of hiding from security products, which is **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
