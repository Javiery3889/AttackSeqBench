To determine the correct answer, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to deliver a malicious JavaScript file, which executed a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
   - **Execution:** The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector and a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Discovery:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload was used for computer profiling, which involved commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer to gather information on the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer during the computer profiling phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1018):** This tactic involves the gathering of information about the network and systems. The use of whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer are typical actions in this phase.
   - **Credential Access (T1003):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the network discovery phase.
   - **Lateral Movement (T1074):** This tactic involves moving from one system to another, which is not relevant to the initial profiling phase.
   - **Resource Development (T1560):** This tactic involves developing and maintaining resources, which is not directly related to the initial profiling phase.

Given the context of the CTI outline, the profiling phase involves gathering information about the network and systems, which aligns with the Discovery tactic (T1018).

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
