Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign targeted English-speaking organizations or those with English-speaking regional offices.
   - **Execution:** The shellcode in the macro executed the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence on the system.
   - **Discovery:** The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** The Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after reconnaissance activities identifying English-speaking targets but before the shellcode within Word macros executed the Rising Sun implant payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This is the initial phase where the campaign identified English-speaking targets.
   - **Execution:** This is the phase where the shellcode executes the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Initial Access:** This is the phase where the adversary gains access to the target network, which could be through the malicious documents.
   - **Exfiltration:** This is the phase where data is exfiltrated, which happens after the implant is in place.
   - **Command and Control:** This is the phase where the implant communicates with the C2 servers, which happens after the implant is installed.

Given the sequence of events:
- The reconnaissance phase identified English-speaking targets.
- The initial access phase would involve gaining entry, which could be through the malicious documents.
- The execution phase would follow, where the shellcode runs and the Rising Sun implant is deployed.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs that fits the criteria of occurring after reconnaissance and before the execution of the Rising Sun implant is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
