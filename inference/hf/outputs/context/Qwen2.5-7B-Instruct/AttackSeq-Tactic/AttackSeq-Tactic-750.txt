Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
2. **Execution**: Using scripting (Batch files, VBScript) and rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, and relying on user execution of malicious email attachments.
3. **Persistence**: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscation, modifying registry keys, and code signing.
5. **Discovery**: Backdoors automatically list interesting files.
6. **Lateral Movement**: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macros to propagate.
7. **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
8. **Exfiltration**: Uploading harvested documents to C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question mentions:
- Backdoors automatically listing interesting files.
- Leveraging malicious macros in Word and Excel documents for propagation.
- Searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. The outline does not mention any actions that would directly escalate privileges.
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. The backdoors listing interesting files and searching for sensitive documents aligns with this tactic.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While the outline mentions C&C, the question is specifically about searching for sensitive documents.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. The outline does not mention any actions that would directly obtain credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoors automatically list interesting files, which is a form of collection.
- The use of malicious macros in Word and Excel documents to search for sensitive documents is a method of collection.
- The question is asking about the tactic that most likely occurred as Gamaredon searched for sensitive documents, which aligns with the Collection tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Collection
