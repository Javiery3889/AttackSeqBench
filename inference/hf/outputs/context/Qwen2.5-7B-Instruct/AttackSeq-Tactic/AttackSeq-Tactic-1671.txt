Let's follow the steps to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
From the CTI outline, we can extract the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used malicious Microsoft Office documents via spear-phishing.
2. **Execution**: The malware decodes and executes a PE file.
3. **Persistence**: The malware creates a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses password-protected macros and classical string obfuscation.
5. **Discovery**: The malware retrieves the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.
6. **Command and Control**: The malware uses HTTP and DNS for C2 communication.
7. **Impact**: The campaign could have a significant impact by intercepting traffic and harvesting credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involved understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets before the initial access through spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves creating tools and resources, which is not directly related to understanding the network infrastructure.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network and systems, which aligns with the need to understand the victims' network infrastructure and identify valuable targets.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access, which is not relevant to the initial understanding of the network.
- **Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, which is not relevant to the initial understanding of the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used malicious websites hosting job listings to gain initial access, which is a form of spear-phishing.
- Before this initial access, the attackers would need to understand the victims' network infrastructure and identify valuable targets.
- The only ATT&CK tactic that fits this description is **Reconnaissance**, as it involves gathering information about the target network and systems.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
