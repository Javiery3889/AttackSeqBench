Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN4 uses spearphishing emails to gather information about their targets.
   - **Initial Access:** They employ spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access to the targets' information.
   - **Credential Access:** They use the VBA macros to prompt users for their Outlook credentials, which are then sent to their C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:** They use C2 servers to collect stolen credentials and communicate with the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a tactic that occurred after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails embedding VBA macros but before using Microsoft Outlook rules to suppress notifications of account compromise.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Initial Access -> [Tactic] -> Suppression of Notifications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is already covered by the spearphishing emails with VBA macros.
   - **Suppression of Notifications:** This is a tactic used to hide the fact that an account has been compromised, which is part of the Command and Control phase.
   - **Credential Access:** This is the process of stealing credentials, which happens after initial access but before suppression of notifications.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This involves techniques to avoid detection, which could include suppression of notifications, but it is not the primary focus here.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This involves moving from one system to another, which is not directly related to the suppression of notifications.
   - **Resource Development:** This is about organizing and labeling stolen credentials, which is not directly related to the suppression of notifications.

Given the sequence and the context provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (spearphishing emails with VBA macros)
- Credential Access (stealing Outlook credentials)
- Suppression of Notifications (using Microsoft Outlook rules to hide account compromise)

Therefore, the answer that best fits the sequence is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
