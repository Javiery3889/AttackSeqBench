Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
2. **Resource Development**: Bankshot implants are developed and distributed from a malicious domain.
3. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document are used to gain initial access.
4. **Execution**: The Bankshot implant is executed via the Word document.
5. **Persistence**: The implant persists on the victim's network.
6. **Defense Evasion**: The implant evades detection and persists for further exploitation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the Bankshot implants, which had already persisted on the victim's network, communicated with hardcoded control servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement (T1078)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. The question does not mention moving to other systems, so this is unlikely.
- **Discovery (T1083)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and services. The question does not mention discovering new resources or services, so this is unlikely.
- **Defense Evasion (T1027)**: This tactic involves avoiding or inhibiting defensive mechanisms. The question does not mention evading defenses, so this is unlikely.
- **Command and Control (T1047)**: This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, and using channels for command and control. The question specifically mentions the implants communicating with hardcoded control servers, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the Bankshot implant persisting on the victim's network and evading detection.
- The question asks about the tactic when the implants communicated with hardcoded control servers.
- The communication with control servers is a form of command and control, which is the process of establishing and maintaining channels for command and control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
