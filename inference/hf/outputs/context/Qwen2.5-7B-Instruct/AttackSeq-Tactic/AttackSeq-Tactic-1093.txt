Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Iron group deployed a backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
   - **Execution:** The malware checks for VM execution, drops and installs a malicious Chrome extension, creates a mutex based on the CPU's version, and drops a backdoor DLL.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses anti-VM techniques and dynamic function calls to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor decrypts hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory and fetches payload URLs from hardcoded Pastebin addresses.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs that occurred after the malware determined the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security and chose its installation method accordingly, but before the group used dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The malware's behavior of checking for the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security and choosing its installation method accordingly is a form of **Discovery**. This is because the malware is trying to determine the environment and make decisions based on the presence of security software.
   - **Collection** is not relevant here as it pertains to gathering data, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Persistence** involves maintaining access to the system, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Defense Evasion** involves techniques to avoid detection, which is mentioned in the question but not the first step.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- **Discovery:** The malware determines the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security.
- **Execution:** The malware then chooses its installation method accordingly.

Therefore, the correct answer is the TTP that directly follows the discovery of security software and precedes the use of anti-VM and dynamic function calls.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
