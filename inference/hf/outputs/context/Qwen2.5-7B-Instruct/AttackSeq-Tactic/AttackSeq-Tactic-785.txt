Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers to company employees.
   - These documents activate malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - The attackers then use system utilities for reconnaissance.
   - They execute malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the delivery of malicious documents, which is part of the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The next step is the activation of macros, which is also part of "Initial Access."
   - The use of system utilities for reconnaissance is part of the "Reconnaissance" tactic.
   - The execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor is part of the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the delivery of malicious documents and before the execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - The delivery of malicious documents and the activation of macros fall under "Initial Access."
   - The use of system utilities for reconnaissance is part of "Reconnaissance."
   - The execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor is part of "Execution."

4. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - "Initial Access" (A) is the first step and does not fit the criteria.
   - "Execution" (B) is the last step and does not fit the criteria.
   - "Credential Access" (C) is not mentioned in the CTI outline and does not fit the criteria.
   - "Reconnaissance" (D) fits the criteria as it occurs after the initial access and before the execution of malicious code.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
