To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - Initial Access: The attackers used a supply chain compromise, specifically a compromised software update, as their initial access vector.
   - Discovery: The report mentions Discovery techniques such as T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry, which the threat actors used to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network of the compromised organizations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the threat actors used Discovery techniques such as Process Discovery and Query Registry to gather information about the targeted systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry) are mentioned as occurring after the Initial Access.
   - The question is asking for the tactic that occurred before these Discovery techniques.
   - The Initial Access (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) is the first step in the attack sequence, followed by the use of various techniques to gain deeper insights into the network and systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - After gaining Initial Access, the attackers would need to establish a foothold and gather information about the systems and network.
   - The Discovery techniques (Process Discovery and Query Registry) are used to gather this information.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the Discovery techniques is the Initial Access.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: Initial Access
