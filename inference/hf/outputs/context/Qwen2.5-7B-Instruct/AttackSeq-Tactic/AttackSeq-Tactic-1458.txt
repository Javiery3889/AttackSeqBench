Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor.
2. **Execution**: The MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper, which installs a JS decryptor and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
3. **Persistence**: The JavaScript dropper, Scr.js, creates a scheduled task named PolicyConverter for persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
5. **Command and Control**: The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with the C&C via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurs after setting up persistence through a scheduled task named PolicyConverter and before communicating with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: The scheduled task named PolicyConverter is created for persistence.
- **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicates with the C&C via HTTP POST requests.

The TTP that occurs after setting up persistence and before Command and Control is **Discovery**. This is because the next logical step after ensuring the system is persistently infected would be to gather information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities, which is the essence of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The PolicyConverter scheduled task is created to ensure the backdoor remains active.
2. **Discovery**: After setting up persistence, the next step is to gather information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities.
3. **Command and Control**: Once the system is understood, the backdoor can then communicate with the C&C.

Given the options:
- **A: Resource Development** - This is not directly related to the immediate next step after persistence.
- **B: Discovery** - This aligns with the logical sequence of gathering information about the system.
- **C: Exfiltration** - This occurs after Command and Control, not before.
- **D: Command and Control** - This is the final step after Discovery and persistence.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
