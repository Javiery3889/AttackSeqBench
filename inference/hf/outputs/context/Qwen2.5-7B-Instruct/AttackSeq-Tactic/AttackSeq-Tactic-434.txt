Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attack began with targeted emails containing malicious documents.
2. **Execution**: The malicious document contained a macro that executed a VBScript named 'PlayList.vbs'.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The VBS script was obfuscated and designed to delete itself after execution.
4. **Command and Control**: The VBS script attempted to communicate with a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred after the obfuscated VBScript executed using 'wscript.exe' and before the VBS script communicated with a C&C server. This implies we need to identify the TTP that happens between the execution of the script and the C&C communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. It does not fit the context of the question, as the question is about an action that happens between the execution of the script and the C&C communication.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The outline mentions that the VBS script was obfuscated and designed to delete itself after execution, which is a form of defense evasion. However, this action occurs immediately after the execution of the script.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. There is no indication in the outline that the script performed any reconnaissance activities.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running code or scripts. The question asks about the TTP that occurs after the execution of the script and before the C&C communication. Since the script has already been executed, the next logical step would be the C&C communication, but the question is asking for the TTP that occurs immediately after execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The outline clearly states that the VBS script was executed using 'wscript.exe'.
- After execution, the script was designed to delete itself to avoid detection, which is a form of defense evasion.
- The next step would be the C&C communication, but the question is asking for the TTP that occurs immediately after the execution of the script.

Given the context and the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible TTP that occurs after the execution of the script and before the C&C communication is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
