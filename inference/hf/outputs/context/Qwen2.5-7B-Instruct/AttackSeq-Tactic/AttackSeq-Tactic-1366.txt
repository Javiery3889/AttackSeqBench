Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Attackers used malicious RTF files, self-extracting Windows executables, and RAR archives.
   - **Execution:** Scote malware provides backdoor access and collects C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scote malware uses various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware collects C2 information from Pastebin and Google+.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurs after the Scote malware uses multiple techniques to evade detection and retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic is about evading detection, which is already mentioned in the outline.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This involves gathering information to be used for future attacks, but it doesn't directly relate to establishing communications.
   - **Command and Control:** This involves the malware communicating with its C2 servers, which aligns with the question's description of retrieving information from Pastebin and Google+ to establish communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** This involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker, which is not the focus of the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Scote malware has already evaded detection.
   - The next step is to retrieve C2 information from Pastebin and Google+.
   - This retrieval of information to establish communications with the C2 servers is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
