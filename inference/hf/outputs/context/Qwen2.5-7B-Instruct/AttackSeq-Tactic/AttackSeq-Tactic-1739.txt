Let's follow the steps to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Turla used stolen credentials to deploy LightNeuron.
2. **Execution**: A PowerShell script was used to install LightNeuron.
3. **Discovery**: LightNeuron can execute functions to discover system network configurations.
4. **Collection**: LightNeuron collects emails and local files.
5. **Command and Control**: LightNeuron uses emails for C&C communication.
6. **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated through the email C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations. The relevant part of the question is:
- After the attackers used a PowerShell script to deploy LightNeuron on the compromised Microsoft Exchange servers, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations?

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target environment, which is done before the execution of any malware.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves deploying the malware, which is done after initial access.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves LightNeuron discovering system network configurations, which is done after it is installed and executing.

Given the sequence in the CTI outline, the execution of the PowerShell script to deploy LightNeuron (Execution) happens before the discovery of system network configurations (Discovery).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the PowerShell script was used to deploy LightNeuron, which is part of the Execution phase.
- The next phase, according to the CTI outline, is the Discovery phase, where LightNeuron discovers system network configurations.
- Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations is Execution.

Final Answer: D: Execution
