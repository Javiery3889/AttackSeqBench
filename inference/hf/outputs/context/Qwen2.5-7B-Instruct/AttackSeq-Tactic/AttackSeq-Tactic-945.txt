Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The MuddyWater campaign uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The macro triggers the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation of the macro scripts to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with a C&C server to execute various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.
   - The sequence of events described in the outline is: Initial Access -> Execution -> Defense Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step where the campaign gains entry into the target environment.
   - **Execution (B):** This is the step where the malicious PowerShell commands are executed after enabling the macro.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This is the step where the campaign uses obfuscation to evade detection.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This is not mentioned in the sequence and is not directly related to the initial steps of the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The outline clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a lure document with a malicious macro.
   - The execution of the malicious routine follows the enabling of the macro.
   - The obfuscation of the scripts is a method used to evade detection, which happens after the execution of the malicious routine.

Given this sequence, the tactic that occurs before the campaign employs obfuscated scripts is the execution of the malicious routine.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
