Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives.
   - **Execution:** The malware components (netsat.exe, netui3.dll, winmgt.dll) operate and collect system information.
   - **Discovery:** Detailed system information is collected, including IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected in the form of files, possibly obfuscated.
   - **Command and Control:** Commands are received from an encrypted file on the local system.
   - **Exfiltration:** The means of exfiltration are not determined.
   - **Self-Deletion:** The malware self-deletes if the system date is past a hardcoded date.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the malware collected detailed system information but before the malware self-deleted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1081):** This tactic involves the gathering of information about the network, hosts, and users. The malware collects detailed system information, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **Exfiltration (T1040):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location. The question specifies that the malware has not yet exfiltrated the data.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1090):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference from defensive measures. The malware self-deletes to avoid detection, but this is not the immediate next step after collecting information.
   - **Credential Access (T1003):** This tactic involves the theft of credentials. There is no mention of credential theft in the CTI outline.

Given the sequence of events described in the CTI outline, the malware collects detailed system information (Discovery) and then self-deletes (Defense Evasion). Therefore, the tactic that occurs immediately after the collection of detailed system information but before the self-deletion is Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
