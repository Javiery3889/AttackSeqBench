Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The starting point of the attack.
2. **Execution**: Execution of malicious code.
3. **Persistence**: Ensuring ongoing access to the compromised network.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Bypassing security measures.
6. **Credential Access**: Obtaining valid credentials.
7. **Discovery**: Locating relevant systems, users, and data.
8. **Lateral Movement**: Moving across the network to relevant data.
9. **Collection**: Collecting the relevant data.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating the collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled attackers to maintain communication and control over the compromised infrastructure after persistence and before exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: Ensures ongoing access to the network.
- **Exfiltration**: The final phase of the attack where data is taken out of the network.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the tactic in question enables attackers to maintain communication and control over the compromised infrastructure after persistence and before exfiltration.
- **Persistence** is about ensuring ongoing access, but it does not necessarily involve maintaining communication and control.
- **Exfiltration** is the final phase and does not involve maintaining communication and control.
- **Command and Control (C2)** is specifically about maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure, which fits the description in the question.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
