Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Email with a PDF attachment that was actually an executable file.
   - **Execution:** The executable file created a folder, extracted files, and ran various scripts and batch files.
   - **Persistence:** Modified the Windows registry and used legitimate applications to collect credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts.
   - **Credential Access:** Used legitimate applications to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers.
   - **Collection:** Collected credentials recurrently every hour.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated stolen credentials to an FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the attackers established a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server.
   - The question is specifically about the tactic used to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing resources for the attacker, which does not fit the context of uploading stolen credentials.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data, which is what the attackers did by collecting credentials every hour. However, the question is about the exfiltration, not the collection.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target, which is not the action of uploading stolen credentials.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which can include establishing a mechanism to upload stolen data to an external server. This fits the context of the question.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
