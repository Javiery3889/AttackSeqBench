Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms and before using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic is directly mentioned as occurring before the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic is mentioned as using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, which is after the interference with logging mechanisms.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic is mentioned as establishing C2, which is not directly related to the sequence before reconnaissance.
   - **Persistence:** This tactic is mentioned as maintaining persistence, which is not directly related to the sequence before reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection (Defense Evasion).
   - After this, TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance (Discovery).

Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection and before TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
