Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with HTML attachments that redirect to cloud storage sites to download a malicious ZIP file.
   - **Execution:** The malicious executable (HTA script) extracts and runs a VBS script that fetches and downloads the final payload (banking Trojan).
   - **Persistence:** Registry keys and a VBS script for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of public cloud infrastructure and legitimate signed binaries.
   - **Collection:** Malware captures screenshots and mouse clicks.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C2 server over raw TCP on port 9999.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the banking Trojan collected information like hostname and operating system version from the victim's system.
   - The banking Trojan is part of the "Collection" phase, as it captures information from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the network, systems, and resources. It is not directly related to the collection of information from the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the victim's systems. It is more about communication with the C2 server rather than collecting information.
   - **Collection:** This is the phase where the malware gathers information from the victim's system, which matches the question.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the victim's system. While it is part of the process, it is not the phase where the malware collects information.

Given the context, the banking Trojan (part of the "Collection" phase) would collect information like hostname and operating system version after it has been executed and established a foothold on the victim's system. The phase that would precede this is "Execution," where the malware is run and begins to gather information.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
