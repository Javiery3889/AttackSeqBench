To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's first extract the relevant attack sequence from the CTI outline and then compare it with the question and answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
2. **Execution**: Executing a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
3. **Persistence**: Utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework that operates in-memory.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Using custom tools and techniques for privilege escalation.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Interfering with logging mechanisms and evading commercial EDRs.
6. **Credential Access**: Modifying login webpages to record credentials.
7. **Lateral Movement**: Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
8. **Command and Control**: Deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it is a critical step, it does not directly relate to scanning and mapping targets.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems within it. SharpHound and PowerSploit are tools used for discovery and reconnaissance.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. While it is a critical step, it does not directly relate to scanning and mapping.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While it can be used for gaining access to systems, it does not directly relate to scanning and mapping.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that would precede the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets is **Discovery**. SharpHound and PowerSploit are reconnaissance tools used to gather information about the network and systems, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
