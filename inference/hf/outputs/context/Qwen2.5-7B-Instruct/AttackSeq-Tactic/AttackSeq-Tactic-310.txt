Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the delivery of malicious documents containing VBA macros.
   - These documents execute to download and run the first-stage payload (Zebrocy).
   - The next steps include:
     - Execution of the Delphi downloader.
     - Persistence through registry entries.
     - Reconnaissance on the victim computer.
     - Command and Control (C&C) communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malicious documents executed VBA macros to deliver first-stage payloads.
   - The options are:
     - A: Reconnaissance
     - B: Collection
     - C: Initial Access
     - D: Exfiltration

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The CTI outline mentions the delivery of malicious documents, which is a form of initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. The CTI outline states that the AutoIt downloader performs extensive reconnaissance on the victim computer.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering and storing data from the target. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate next step after the initial payload execution.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target. This is a later step in the attack sequence, not immediately after the initial payload execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malicious documents are delivered and execute VBA macros to download the first-stage payload.
   - The next step is the execution of the Delphi downloader, which is part of the execution phase.
   - After the execution of the Delphi downloader, the next phase is persistence, which involves adding registry entries.
   - Following persistence, the malware performs reconnaissance on the victim computer.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, is that after the initial payload execution, the next step is reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A"
