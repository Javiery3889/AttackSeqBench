Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report outlines the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Resource Development**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creating registry Run key entries and installing SparrowDoor as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not specified in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Injecting encrypted shellcode and adjusting token privileges.
7. **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
8. **Discovery**: Collecting system information.
9. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
10. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after the SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question mentions SparrowDoor communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be the **Exfiltration** of collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Communication with C&C Server**: SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications, which is a **Command and Control** tactic.
2. **Data Collection**: The report states that SparrowDoor collects system information and file contents, which is part of the **Collection** tactic.
3. **Data Exfiltration**: After collecting the data, the next step would be to exfiltrate the collected data to the C&C server, which is the **Exfiltration** tactic.

Given the sequence and the context provided, the most plausible next step after Command and Control is Exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
