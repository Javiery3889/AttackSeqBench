Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used malicious .LNK files to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Stuxnet executed malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stuxnet used zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers using HTTP and implemented an RPC server for peer-to-peer communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Stuxnet employed rootkit functionality and used stolen digital certificates for evasion.
   - The specific vulnerabilities mentioned are MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler, which are used to spread across networked systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the tactic used to spread across networked systems after evasion techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion (A):** This tactic is about evading detection and analysis, which is what Stuxnet did with rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic is about running malicious code, which is already covered in the execution phase.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic is about moving laterally within a network, which is the action of spreading across networked systems.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic is about communicating with C&C servers, which is also mentioned but not the immediate action after evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the action is spreading across networked systems after evasion techniques. This aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic, which involves moving laterally within a network to spread the malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
