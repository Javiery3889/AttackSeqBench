Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gathered system information and network views.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** Malware (TDrop2) executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Process hollowing and obfuscation of the second-stage payload as an image file.
   - **Command and Control:** Malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the attackers evaded defenses by using process hollowing and obfuscating the second-stage payload as an image file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The process hollowing and obfuscation of the second-stage payload as an image file are part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - The next step in the attack sequence, after evading defenses, would be the **Command and Control** tactic, as the malware communicates with the C2 servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct answer is B: Command and Control, as it follows the Defense Evasion tactic in the sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
