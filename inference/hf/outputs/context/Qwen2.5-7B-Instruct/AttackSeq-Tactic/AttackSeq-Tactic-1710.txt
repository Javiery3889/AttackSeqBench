Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Malware delivered via a phishing email with a PowerPoint add-in document.
   - **Execution:** VBA macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours.
   - **Others:** Further details about the persistence mechanism and the 'Outlook.exe' payload.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that establishes communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control after persistence has been established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware uses a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours, which is a persistence mechanism.
   - The question is asking about a tactic that involves communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control, which is a function of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **Persistence** (B) is a tactic that ensures the malware remains active on the system, but it does not directly involve communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.
   - **Command and Control (C2)** (C) is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining the interaction between an attacker and a compromised system, which aligns with the question's requirement for communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is:

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
