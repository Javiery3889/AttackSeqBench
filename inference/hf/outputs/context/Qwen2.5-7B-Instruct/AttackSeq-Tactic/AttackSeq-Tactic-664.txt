Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The OceanLotus group uses a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown' delivered via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros and RAR archives.
   - **Execution:** The malicious Office document contains base64 blobs that are decoded and executed based on the victim's system architecture.
   - **Command and Control:** The final payload, a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, is downloaded from a URL depending on the victim's OS architecture.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system.
   - The key part of the question is "before the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system."

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic is about how the adversary initially gains access to the target system. The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is via a custom downloader malware (KerrDown) delivered through Office documents and RAR archives.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic is about how the adversary communicates with the compromised system. The CTI outline mentions that the final payload (Cobalt Strike Beacon) is downloaded from a URL, which is a form of command and control.
   - **Persistence:** This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention persistence, but it does mention the use of a custom downloader, which could imply some form of persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic is about avoiding detection by the target's security measures. The CTI outline mentions that the base64 blobs are decoded and executed in memory, which could be a form of defense evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory. The CTI outline indicates that the execution of the base64 blobs is part of the execution phase, and the dropping of the DLL in memory without writing it to the system is also part of the execution phase.
   - The initial access phase is the first step, and the execution phase follows. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the execution phase is the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
