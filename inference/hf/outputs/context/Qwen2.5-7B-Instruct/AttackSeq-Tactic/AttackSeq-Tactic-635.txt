Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG-3279 performs reconnaissance via open source research and network scanning.
   - **Resource Development:** TG-3279 reuses network infrastructure and domain names.
   - **Initial Access:** TG-3279 uses a port scanning tool and an RDP brute force tool.
   - **Persistence:** TG-3279 uses optionally loaded DLLs to establish persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG-3279 installs tools by compromising administrator credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG-3279 uses C2 communication over port 443 and employs IP calculations and domain name parking.
   - **Credential Access:** TG-3279 strives to access network and system administrators' accounts.
   - **Command and Control:** TG-3279 uses C2 communication over port 443 with IP calculations and domain name parking.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after gaining credentials from network and system administrators but before deploying scheduled system tasks using Conpee or Etso tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (CredAccess):** This is the tactic that describes the process of gaining credentials, which is mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **Discovery (Discovery):** This tactic involves identifying the network and resources, which is more about the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Lateral Movement (Lateral Movement):** This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another, which would occur after gaining credentials.
   - **Execution (Execution):** This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system, which would be after deploying scheduled tasks.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:
- **Credential Access** (gaining credentials)
- **Lateral Movement** (moving to key hosts)
- **Execution** (deploying scheduled tasks)

The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining credentials but before deploying scheduled tasks. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
