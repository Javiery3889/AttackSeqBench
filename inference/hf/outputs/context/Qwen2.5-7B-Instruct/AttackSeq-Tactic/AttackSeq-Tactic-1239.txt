Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with the delivery of malicious PDF files via spearphishing.
   - **Kernel Injector:** After gaining initial access, the binary loader injects code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial access, specifically when the binary loader began injecting code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, not the step after gaining initial access.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system, which is not directly related to the injection of code into "explorer.exe".
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The injection of code into "explorer.exe" is a form of execution, as it involves running malicious code within a legitimate process.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves stealing data from the target system, which is not directly related to the injection of code into "explorer.exe".

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that after gaining initial access, the next step is the injection of code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem.
   - This injection of code is a form of execution, as it involves running malicious code on the target system.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
