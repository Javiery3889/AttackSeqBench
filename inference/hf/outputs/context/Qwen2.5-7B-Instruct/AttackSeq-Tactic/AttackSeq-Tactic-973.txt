Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader to execute the malware.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to ensure persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker searching for information or assets on the network or host. The CTI outline explicitly states that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another. The CTI outline does not mention any actions that would indicate lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network. The CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data, which aligns with Command and Control.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target network or host. While the CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke steals credentials and searches for files, it does not explicitly state that this is the Collection tactic. The Discovery tactic is more specific to the search for files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
- After the Discovery tactic, the next logical step would be to collect the data found during the search. However, the question specifically asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Discovery step.
- Given the options, the most plausible sequence is that after Discovery, the next step would be to establish and maintain access to the target network, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
