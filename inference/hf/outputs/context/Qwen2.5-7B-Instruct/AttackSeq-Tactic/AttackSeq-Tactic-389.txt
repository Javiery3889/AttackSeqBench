Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** The threat actors acquired domain names and rented servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Visitors to compromised websites were exposed to exploits and spearphishing campaigns.
   - **Execution:** Malicious Word documents with VBA macros were used, and the Document_Open function executed the code.
   - **Others:** The campaign involved web compromises and the use of Candiru implants and exploits.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents, when the scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The execution of VBA macros is part of the **Execution** tactic.
   - The communication with external servers is a form of **Command and Control (C2)**, which is a sub-tactic under the **Command and Control** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of VBA macros is a clear example of the **Execution** tactic.
   - After the execution, the scripts from the watering hole attacks would communicate with external servers, which is a form of **Command and Control**.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the execution, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
