Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign used watering hole tactics with exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - **Execution:** The Chrome exploit vector involved chaining two patched vulnerabilities to execute custom shellcode, which de-obfuscated strings, initialized a network connection, and downloaded a payload named 'dropper.dll'. The dropper.dll then checked for security software presence and downloaded and executed three additional malware samples.
   - **Execution:** The Internet Explorer exploit vector using CVE-2020-0674 ran a PowerShell loader to infect victims with the same three malware variants.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware performed checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect information.
   - **Command and Control:** The SLUB malware communicated with a Mattermost server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The SLUB malware exfiltrated system information and captured screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 to gain system privileges after executing the PowerShell loader via the Internet Explorer exploit vector.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The PowerShell loader, which is part of the Execution phase, is the immediate precursor to the LPE (Privilege Escalation) tactic.
   - The Execution phase involves running code or scripts to achieve a specific goal, which in this case is the execution of the PowerShell loader.
   - The LPE (Privilege Escalation) tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system, which would logically follow the execution of the PowerShell loader.

Given the sequence of events and the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- **Execution:** The PowerShell loader is executed.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 is used to gain system privileges.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation**
