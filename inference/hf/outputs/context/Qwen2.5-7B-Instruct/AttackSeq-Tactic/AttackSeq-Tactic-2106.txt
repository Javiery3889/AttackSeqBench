### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The malicious CCleaner binary was modified to call a specific code path, decrypting and deploying the malware payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware established a C2 channel by encrypting and encoding system information and transmitting it via HTTPS.
   - **Impact:** The impact of the attack was severe due to the widespread use of CCleaner.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled the attackers to compromise Avast's download servers and embed the malicious binary in software accessed by users.
   - The key point here is the initial compromise of the download servers, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic is about establishing and maintaining access to the target network. It does not directly address the initial compromise of the download servers.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic is about running malicious code. It describes the actions after the initial compromise.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic is about moving from the initial foothold to other parts of the network. It is not relevant to the initial compromise of the download servers.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining initial access to the target environment. It directly addresses how the attackers could compromise the download servers and embed the malicious binary.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is that the attackers used the **Initial Access** tactic to compromise Avast's download servers and embed the malicious binary in software accessed by users.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
