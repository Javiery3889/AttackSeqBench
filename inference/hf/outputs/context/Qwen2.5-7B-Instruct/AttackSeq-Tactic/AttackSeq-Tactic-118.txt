Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The 'Surtr' malware creates a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process using the CreateRemoteThread function.
   - **Persistence:** 'Surtr' adds a registry key for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** 'Surtr' uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Word and evades antivirus heuristics.
   - **Discovery:** 'Surtr' has capabilities for listing directories, viewing web cache, executing remote commands, and logging keystrokes.
   - **Command and Control:** 'Surtr' connects to a C2 server and downloads a stage two component.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent to Tibetan organizations and before the 'Surtr' malware was executed by injecting itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's environment. The question mentions that malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent to Tibetan organizations, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves the adversary running code on the target's system. The CTI outline states that 'Surtr' injects itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process, which is the execution step.
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves the adversary developing resources to be used in the attack, which is not directly mentioned in the context of the question.
   - **Impact:** This tactic involves the adversary causing harm to the target's systems or data, which is not mentioned in the context of the question.

Given the context of the question, the sequence of events is:
1. Malicious emails containing trojaned attachments are sent (Initial Access).
2. The trojaned attachment is executed, leading to the execution of 'Surtr' malware.

Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the malicious emails were sent and before the 'Surtr' malware was executed is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
