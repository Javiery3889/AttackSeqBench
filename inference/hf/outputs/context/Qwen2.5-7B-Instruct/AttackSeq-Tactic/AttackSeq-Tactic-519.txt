Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign used malicious documents to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents were used to deliver the Sharpshooter downloader.
   - **Execution:** The macro executed shellcode to download the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading itself to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:** The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that after the Rising Sun implant established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests, the next ATT&CK tactic to send encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers is to be identified.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which is a part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next to send the encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers. Given that the communication is already established, the next step would be to send data to the control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location. While data might be exfiltrated, the question specifically asks about the next step after establishing communication, which is sending data.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves the development of resources, which is not directly related to sending data to control servers.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This is the correct answer as it involves the ongoing communication and sending of data to the control servers.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves the running of code or scripts, which is not the next step after establishing communication.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is:

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
