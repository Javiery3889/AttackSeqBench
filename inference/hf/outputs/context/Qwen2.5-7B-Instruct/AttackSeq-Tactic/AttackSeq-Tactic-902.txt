Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides details about the malware WinDealer and its various tactics:
- **Execution**: WinDealer begins execution by decoding an embedded DLL file with a 10-byte XOR key.
- **Persistence**: WinDealer maintains persistence through the registry's RUN key.
- **Discovery**: WinDealer targets specific applications and references registry keys created by Sogou programs.
- **Command and Control**: WinDealer uses a complex IP generation algorithm and communicates over specific ports or a hardcoded URL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications before WinDealer's persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic involves delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment. It does not directly relate to delivering malware.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is part of the malware lifecycle, it does not specifically address the delivery mechanism.
- **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. It does not directly relate to delivering malware.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target environment, which can include using legitimate application updates to deliver malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the tactic that involves delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.
- The CTI outline mentions that WinDealer targets popular applications in Asia, such as QQ, WeChat, and WangWang, and references registry keys created by Sogou programs.
- This indicates that WinDealer likely uses the automatic update mechanisms of these legitimate applications to deliver itself to the target environment.

Given this analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that involves delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: D
