Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with a specific document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
   - **Execution:** VBS macro in the Word document executes a PowerShell script.
   - **Defense Evasion:** PowerShell script operates in memory and uses DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - **Impact:** GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are downloaded and executed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the PowerShell script avoided detection by operating in memory and leveraging the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The PowerShell script's operation in memory and use of DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk is a form of **Defense Evasion**.
   - The next step in the attack sequence, after the script has evaded detection, would be the actual execution of the payloads (GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about the tactic that occurs after the Defense Evasion step. The next step in the attack sequence is the Execution of the payloads.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Execution**.

Final Answer: C: Execution
