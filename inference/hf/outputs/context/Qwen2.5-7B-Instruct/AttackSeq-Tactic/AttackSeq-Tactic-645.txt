Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The actors transitioned to using DLL side-loading techniques, where a signed executable loads a malicious DLL.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The use of DLL side-loading is mentioned as part of their evasion tactics.
   - **Command and Control:** New C2 infrastructure (etybh[.]com) is associated with the Musical Chairs campaign.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the actors loaded a signed executable to perform DLL side-loading.
   - The sequence of TTPs involves:
     1. Loading a signed executable.
     2. Performing DLL side-loading.
     3. Launching the Gh0st payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic is about the consequences of the attack, not the initial steps.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic is about maintaining access and control over the target, which happens after the initial access and execution.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves the steps to run code or scripts on the target system, which includes loading a signed executable and performing DLL side-loading.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment, which would precede the execution of the signed executable.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:
1. Initial Access (D) to gain access to the target.
2. Execution (C) to load the signed executable and perform DLL side-loading.
3. Command and Control (B) to maintain access and control.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the actors loaded a signed executable to perform DLL side-loading is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: D**
