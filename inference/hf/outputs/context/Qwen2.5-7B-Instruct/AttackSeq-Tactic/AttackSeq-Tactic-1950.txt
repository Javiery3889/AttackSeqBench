Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: The OceanLotus backdoor is executed, opening a hidden file and copying it to the executable path.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoor creates a Launch Agent to ensure it runs at startup.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor avoids detection by using obfuscation techniques and custom binary protocols.
4. **Discovery**: The backdoor gathers information from the victim's machine.
5. **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicates with the command and control server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after OceanLotus distributed the backdoor via a zip file containing a disguised Microsoft Word document application bundle, leading to its execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's environment. The distribution of the backdoor via a disguised zip file containing a Word document application bundle is a form of initial access.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target's system. The CTI outline explicitly states that the backdoor is executed, opening a hidden file and copying it to the executable path.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining higher-level access permissions. The CTI outline does not mention any actions that would elevate privileges.
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing credentials. The CTI outline does not mention any actions that would steal credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the backdoor was distributed via a zip file, which is a form of initial access.
- The execution of the backdoor, as described in the CTI outline, is the next step after the initial access.

Given the sequence of events and the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Initial Access (B) occurred first, followed by Execution (C).

**Final Answer: C**
