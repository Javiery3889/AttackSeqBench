Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used several techniques to evade detection, including file deletion, hidden files and directories, and software packing.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware searched for stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Collection:** Data was collected from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** Credentials were sent to a command and control server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted before being exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a tactic that occurred after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document and before employing techniques such as T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document:** This aligns with the initial access phase, where the spearphishing email contained a malicious Excel document.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1107, T1045):** These techniques are mentioned in the defense evasion phase.
   - **Execution (T1203):** This tactic involves the running of code and can be associated with the execution of the dropped PE file (educrety.exe) after the initial access.
   - **Privilege Escalation (T1543):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
   - **Resource Development (T1560):** This tactic involves the development of resources, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.

Given the sequence of events and the context provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the execution of the dropped PE file after the initial access and before the defense evasion techniques are employed.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
