Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike generates raw, malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 server responds with a large binary blob (beacon.dll) which is used to control an infected host.
   - **Others:** No additional context directly related to the question.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 method used in the attack.
   - The TTPs involved are likely related to setting up the communication between the attacker and the compromised host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves the creation and use of malicious code, which aligns with the generation of raw shellcode and payloads.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system, which is a prerequisite for setting up C2.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system, which is not directly related to setting up C2.
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves the effects of the attack, which is not relevant to the setup of C2.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking about the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 method, which is a step in setting up the communication channel.
   - The "Listeners" are part of the C2 setup, which is a critical step in the attack lifecycle.
   - The "Initial Access" tactic (D) is the first step in the attack lifecycle, where the adversary gains access to the target. After gaining access, the next step is to set up the C2 method, which involves deploying "Listeners."

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that involves the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 method is the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Initial Access.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
