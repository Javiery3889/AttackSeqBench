Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware sideloaded a malicious DLL and performed security checks.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry modifications and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captured system data and stole information like Skype communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrated the collected data, compressing, encrypting, and sending it to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after T9000 captured system data and stole information like Skype communications during the Collection phase. Specifically, it asks which tactic is responsible for sending the encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** This tactic is about gathering data, which is already covered in the CTI outline.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic is about how the malware initially enters the system, which is also covered in the CTI outline.
   - **Impact:** This tactic is about the effects of the malware, which is not directly related to sending data to a C2 server.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic is about the malware communicating with its C2 server, which aligns with the question of sending encrypted data to a C2 server.

Given the CTI outline, the exfiltration phase is clearly described as the process where the malware sends the collected data to a C2 server. This process is a part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
