Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of events:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Domain registrations under the names 'Tawnya Grilth' and 'Eric Charles' were discovered, with the email address jeno_1980@hotmail.com.
2. **Discovery**: CTU analysts sinkholed several 'Tawnya Grilth' domains in 2011 and 2012, redirecting traffic from infected computers to servers for logging and gathering statistics.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after CTU analysts sinkholed the 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging and gathering statistics.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or denial of service. It is unlikely to be the next step after sinkholing the domains.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the methods used to run malicious code, such as code injection or remote code execution. While this is a critical step, it is not directly related to the action of sinkholing domains.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the methods used to communicate with the compromised systems. After sinkholing the domains, the attackers would need to establish a new C2 channel to maintain control over the infected systems.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the methods used to find and identify the target. Since the domains were already sinkholed and the traffic was redirected, the next step would not be discovery but rather maintaining control over the compromised systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the sinkholing of the domains and the redirection of traffic for logging and gathering statistics. This action is a form of Command and Control (C2) where the attackers are trying to maintain control over the infected systems.
- The next logical step after sinkholing the domains would be to establish a new C2 channel to continue the espionage activities.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
