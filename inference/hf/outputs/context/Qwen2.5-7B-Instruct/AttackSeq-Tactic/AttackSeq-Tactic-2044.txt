Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** TA453 initiated a credential phishing campaign named BadBlood, using an actor-controlled Gmail account to send phishing emails.
   - **Phishing Emails:** The emails contained a link to a TA453-controlled domain, 1drv[.]casa, which spoofed Microsoft's OneDrive service.
   - **Forged Microsoft Login Page:** The domain presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the phishing emails directed victims to a TA453-controlled domain mimicking Microsoft's OneDrive service.
   - The context is that user credentials were collected on a forged Microsoft login page.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic is already covered in the CTI outline as the initial step of the campaign.
   - **Command and Control (A):** This tactic involves the threat actor establishing a means of control over compromised systems. It is not directly related to the collection of user credentials.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves the threat actor obtaining credentials, which aligns with the scenario where user credentials are collected on a forged Microsoft login page.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves the threat actor avoiding detection or analysis. While it could be part of the campaign, it is not directly related to the collection of user credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the phishing emails led to a forged Microsoft login page where user credentials were collected.
   - The ATT&CK tactic that best describes the collection of user credentials is "Credential Access."

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
