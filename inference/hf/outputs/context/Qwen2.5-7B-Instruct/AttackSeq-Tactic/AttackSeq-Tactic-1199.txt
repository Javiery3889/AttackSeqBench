Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance (July to August 2011):** The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Initial Access (July to August 2011):** Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks.
   - **Persistence (February 2014):** The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attack group conducted reconnaissance through phishing domains and before they established alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This tactic is mentioned in the outline, but it is the initial phase of the attack, not after the reconnaissance through phishing domains.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic is mentioned in the outline and occurred after the reconnaissance through phishing domains (July to August 2011) and before the persistence phase (February 2014).
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic is mentioned in the outline and occurred after the initial access phase, which is not what the question is asking for.
   - **Credential Access (A):** While credential access is a part of the reconnaissance phase, it is not specifically mentioned as occurring after the reconnaissance through phishing domains and before persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The reconnaissance through phishing domains is clearly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The initial access phase, which involved leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, is the next phase after the reconnaissance.
   - The persistence phase is mentioned as occurring later, after the initial access phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that fits the criteria of occurring after reconnaissance through phishing domains and before establishing alternative means of persistence is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
