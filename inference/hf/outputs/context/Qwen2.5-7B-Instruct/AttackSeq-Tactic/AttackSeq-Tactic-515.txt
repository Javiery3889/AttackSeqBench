Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign used malicious documents to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents containing a macro were used to inject the Sharpshooter downloader into Word's memory.
   - **Persistence:** The Sharpshooter downloader retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, and ensured persistence by downloading it to the startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after gaining initial access but before ensuring persistence.
   - The initial access is described as the use of malicious documents with macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (A):** This is the tactic that ensures the implant remains on the system after initial access. It occurs after the Sharpshooter downloader has been injected into memory and before the second-stage binary is downloaded to the startup folder.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running code or scripts. While the Sharpshooter downloader is executed, this is part of the initial access phase.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving from one system to another. There is no indication of lateral movement in the provided CTI outline.
   - **Impact (D):** This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. This is not mentioned as occurring before persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through the use of malicious documents with macros.
   - The Sharpshooter downloader is then injected into Word's memory.
   - The next step is to ensure persistence, which involves downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The tactic that occurs after initial access but before persistence is Execution, as the Sharpshooter downloader is executed to inject itself into memory.

Final Answer: B: Execution
