Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: GreyEnergy targets energy companies and high-value organizations for espionage and reconnaissance.
- **Resource Development**: The malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules.
- **Initial Access**: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers as infection vectors.
- **Persistence**: Malware components are securely wiped from victims' hard drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses stealth techniques, including partial encryption and running modules in memory.
- **Credential Access**: Uses Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner for credential access.
- **Command and Control**: Internal C&C proxies redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after GreyEnergy operators gained credential access using tools such as Mimikatz and before they established internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access**: This is the initial step where the operators gain access to credentials.
- **Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from the initial point of compromise to other systems within the network.
- **Command and Control**: This involves establishing a connection with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access**: This is the first step where the operators gain access to credentials using tools like Mimikatz.
2. **Lateral Movement**: After gaining credentials, the operators would likely move laterally to other systems within the network to spread the infection and gather more information.
3. **Command and Control**: Once they have moved laterally, they would establish a connection with the C&C server to exfiltrate data and receive further instructions.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is **Lateral Movement**. This occurs after gaining credentials and before establishing internal C&C proxies.

Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
