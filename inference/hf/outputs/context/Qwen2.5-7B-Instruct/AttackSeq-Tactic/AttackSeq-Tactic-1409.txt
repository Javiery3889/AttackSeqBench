Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key attack sequence:
1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator targets macOS systems by infecting victims with a trojanized version of the 3CX software.
2. **Execution**: Smooth Operator executes as part of the 3CX software, using a constructor function within the dylib.
3. **Persistence**: Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Smooth Operator employs various techniques to evade detection, including daemonizing, deleting itself, and obfuscating traffic.
5. **Discovery**: Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine.
6. **Collection**: Smooth Operator stages and collects data from the victim machine.
7. **Command and Control**: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers.
8. **Exfiltration**: Smooth Operator exfiltrates collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The CTI outline mentions that the malware is distributed through a trojanized version of the 3CX software, which is a form of initial access.
- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the target's resources and network.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing credentials.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
The question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial distribution of the trojanized software. The initial distribution of the trojanized software is the initial access, which is the first step in the attack sequence. Therefore, the next step would be the execution of the malware.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
