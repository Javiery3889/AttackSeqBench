Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
4. **Discovery**: Capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, along with network service scanning.
5. **Collection**: Archiving of collected data using a custom storage file format.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL encryption and proxy tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor established communication with the C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question mentions that the SombRAT backdoor has already established communication with the C2 servers. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to transfer the collected data.

- **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves developing tools, resources, or capabilities. It does not fit the context of transferring collected data.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network. While it is related to the C2 communication, it does not specifically address the transfer of collected data.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target to the attacker. Given that the SombRAT backdoor has already collected data, the next step would be to transfer this data to the attacker.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network. It does not fit the context of transferring collected data to the attacker.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SombRAT backdoor has already established communication with the C2 servers.
- The next logical step is to transfer the collected data to the attacker.
- Among the given options, **Exfiltration (C)** is the most appropriate tactic for transferring the collected data.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
