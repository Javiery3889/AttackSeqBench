Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware (e.g., PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT) and uses tools like mimikatz for credential theft.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 achieves persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses stolen credentials to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses various methods to evade detection, including DLL search order hijacking and sideloading.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 pushes and pulls data to and from victim networks.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after APT10 used tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network using Windows and open-source pentesting tools.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Quasar RAT and mimikatz usage:** These tools are part of the Execution phase, specifically for establishing a foothold and gaining credentials.
   - **Internal reconnaissance:** This is part of the Discovery phase, where APT10 uses tools like Windows and open-source pentesting tools to map the network.

Given the sequence:
- **Execution** (using Quasar RAT and mimikatz) -> **Persistence** (ensuring malware remains active) -> **Discovery** (conducting internal reconnaissance).

The tactic that fits between the use of Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and the internal reconnaissance phase is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
