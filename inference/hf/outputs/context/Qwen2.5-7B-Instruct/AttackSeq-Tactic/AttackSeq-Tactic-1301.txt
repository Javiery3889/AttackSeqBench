Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious links or weaponized Word documents.
   - **Execution:** Fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads.
   - **Persistence:** Established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Exploited DLL hijacking and DNS Tunneling.
   - **Credential Access:** Harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** Performed lateral movement and infected new machines.
   - **Command and Control:** Used HTTP and DNS Tunneling, and a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data using the backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks, and before they exfiltrated data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Pass-the-Ticket and Pass-the-Hash Attacks:** These are methods of credential access and lateral movement.
   - **Infecting New Machines:** This is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - **Exfiltration:** This is the final step, which is covered by the Command and Control tactic.

Given the sequence of events:
- **Pass-the-Ticket and Pass-the-Hash Attacks** and **Infecting New Machines** fall under the **Lateral Movement** tactic.
- **Exfiltration** is covered by the **Command and Control** tactic.

Therefore, the tactic that occurred after the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines and before they exfiltrated data is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
