Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The MuddyWater attackers used open-source tools such as Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, and Invoke-Obfuscation. They also used GitHub for hosting their backdoor, POWERSTATS, and compiled it as an executable using PS2EXE.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers utilized C2 domains and proxy URLs for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved utilizing GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or defend against defensive measures. While the CTI outline mentions GitHub and custom backdoors, it does not specifically mention the use of region-specific malicious documents for initial access.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to initially compromise a system. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of region-specific malicious documents for initial access.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves the methods used to maintain access and control over the compromised system. The CTI outline does not mention the use of region-specific malicious documents for initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves the methods used to gather information to be used for future attacks. The CTI outline does not mention the use of region-specific malicious documents for initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions the use of GitHub for hosting custom backdoors, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic. However, the question specifically asks about the initial compromise, which is more aligned with the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The use of region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems is a method of initial access, as it involves the initial compromise of a system.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
