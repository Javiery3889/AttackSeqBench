Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities and malvertising to deliver exploits.
   - **Initial Access:** RIG EK uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.
   - **Execution:** Upon execution, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - **Command and Control:** RIG EK's infrastructure includes VDS, proxy servers, and an API server. The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the infrastructure tested malware against antivirus detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Execution (running obfuscated PowerShell scripts) and then testing against antivirus detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (Tactic):** This is the process of running the obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender, such as evading antivirus detection.
   - **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** This involves gaining higher-level access to the system.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):** This involves maintaining access to the victim's system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of the obfuscated PowerShell script is a part of the Execution tactic.
   - After the execution, the infrastructure would likely test the malware against antivirus detection to ensure it remains undetected. This testing is a form of Defense Evasion.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the infrastructure tested malware against antivirus detection is Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
