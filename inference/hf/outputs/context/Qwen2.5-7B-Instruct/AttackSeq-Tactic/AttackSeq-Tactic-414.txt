Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
   - **Execution:** Running commands, uploading tools.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and the Dumpert tool.
   - **Discovery:** Running commands for initial discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** Using the AntSword webshell for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the actors performed lateral movement using credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert tool are mentioned in the context of **Defense Evasion**.
   - The use of credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques is part of **Credential Access**.
   - Lateral movement is explicitly mentioned as a separate tactic.

Given the sequence of events:
- **Defense Evasion** (using custom Mimikatz and Dumpert)
- **Credential Access** (obtaining credentials through memory dumping and pass-the-hash)
- **Lateral Movement** (using the obtained credentials)

The question is asking for the tactic that occurred before the actors performed lateral movement using the obtained credentials. Therefore, the correct answer is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
