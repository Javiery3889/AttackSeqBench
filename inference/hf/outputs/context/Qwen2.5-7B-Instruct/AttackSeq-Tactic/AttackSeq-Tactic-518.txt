Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information.
   - **Exfiltration:** The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that establishes communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests after the initial reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic is about gathering information, which is already covered in the CTI outline.
   - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location, which aligns with the CTI outline where the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the establishment of a channel for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system. The CTI outline mentions that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data to a control server, which is a form of C2 communication.
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic is about developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack, which is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic is about identifying and classifying the target, which is already covered in the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the establishment of communication with the control server using encrypted HTTP POST requests, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
