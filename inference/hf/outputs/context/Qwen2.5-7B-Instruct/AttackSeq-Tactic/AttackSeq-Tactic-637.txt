Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by GreyEnergy. Here are the key points:
- **Initial Access**: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers.
- **Persistence**: Securely wiping malware components from victims' hard drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: Using stealth techniques, partial encryption, and running modules in memory.
- **Credential Access**: Using tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
- **Lateral Movement**: Deploying internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks.
- **Command and Control**: Using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to an external C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers before achieving initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic is about establishing, maintaining, and controlling access to the victim's network. It is not directly related to the initial targeting of specific workstations.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the tools, infrastructure, and other resources used in the attack. It is more about the malware framework and not the initial targeting.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's network. It is not directly related to the initial targeting of specific workstations.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It is directly related to the initial targeting of specific workstations, as it would involve identifying and understanding the target environment, including ICS control workstations running SCADA software.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reconnaissance** is the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that would inform the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers. This is because reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target environment, which would include identifying critical systems like ICS control workstations.
- The other tactics (Command and Control, Resource Development, and Collection) are more about the actions taken after initial access or the maintenance of the attack, not the initial targeting.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
