Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The malware downloads a compressed folder with trojanized files that masquerade as PDFs and JPEGs.
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence through reboots by adding a registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals web session cookies.
   - **Collection:** The agent collects data from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** The agent communicates with a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The agent exfiltrates data over the command and control channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the victim was enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider.
   - The malware disguises itself as decoy business files and is executed after the victim follows a link.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the target's information and resources. It does not fit the scenario of the malware being executed.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves the adversary running code on the target's system. The malware is executed after the victim follows a link, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The scenario does not describe the initial access but rather the execution of the malware after the initial access.
   - **Persistence:** This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's network or system. While the malware does ensure persistence, the question is specifically about the execution of the malware after the initial access.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the victim was enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider is the execution of the malware.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
