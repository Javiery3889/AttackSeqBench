Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign uses malicious documents with macros to deliver the payload.
   - **Execution:** The payload creates files in the ProgramData directory, uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script, and adds the VBS script path to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Persistence:** The VBS script path is added to the task scheduler.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The PowerShell script uses obfuscation and the scriptlet and inf files use publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server is done via XML messages.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the backdoor function began collecting machine information and taking screenshots.
   - The backdoor function is part of the **Collection** tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the communication with the C&C server, which happens after the backdoor function has already collected and sent data.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is not directly related to the backdoor function's actions.
   - **C: Collection** - This is the tactic where the backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is part of the process but not the immediate step before collection.

Given the sequence of events in the CTI outline, the step that occurs before the backdoor function begins collecting machine information and taking screenshots is the execution of the PowerShell script with obfuscation and persistence setup.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
