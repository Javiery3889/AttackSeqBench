Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI outline describes a Command and Control (C2) infrastructure used by the actor.
   - The actor uses a legitimate IP address (AWS Global Accelerator) to conceal their C2 server.
   - The payload runs as a Windows security update service and establishes communication with the C2 to download and execute files.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence:**
   - The attack sequence involves the use of a C2 infrastructure, which is a part of the Command and Control (T1071) tactic.

3. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions the Bitter APT group exploiting known vulnerabilities using spear-phishing emails with weaponized maldocs.
   - This indicates the initial phase of the attack, which is typically covered by the Initial Access (T1190) tactic.

4. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the initial access phase.
   - The CTI outline describes the C2 infrastructure, which is a subsequent step after the initial access.

5. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources, which is not directly related to the C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through the network, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the infrastructure used to control and communicate with the compromised systems, which aligns with the CTI outline.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment, which is the first step and not the subsequent step.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The CTI outline clearly describes the Command and Control infrastructure, which is a step after the initial access phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the initial access.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
