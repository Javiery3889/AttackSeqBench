Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails.
   - **Persistence:** Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses multiple methods to evade detection and emulation.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Discovery:** Collects information about the victim, including computer name, username, operating system version, and installed security products.
   - **Others:** Additional context about the malware's history and distribution methods.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involves operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval from the C&C server after the malware has collected victim information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic is about gathering information about the victim's environment, which is already covered in the CTI outline.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This involves moving laterally within the network, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **Command and Control:** This involves establishing and maintaining access to the C&C server, which is relevant to the question.
   - **Impact:** This is about the effects of the malware, which is not directly related to the communication and command retrieval process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that Grandoreiro uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to hide its C&C address and is modular with separate DLLs for each targeted bank. This indicates that the malware communicates with its C&C server.
   - The question specifically asks about operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
