Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Operation Sharpshooter began with malicious documents distributed via an IP address in the United States and through Dropbox.
   - **Execution:** The malicious macro in winword.exe acted as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence on the system.
   - **Discovery:** The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** The Rising Sun implant encrypted and exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs that occurred after the initial masquerading activity (which is part of Initial Access) and before the malicious macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the threat actor gains access to the target environment. The outline mentions the distribution of malicious documents via an IP address and Dropbox.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This is the process of gathering information about the target. The outline states that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
   - **Execution (D):** This is the step where the malicious macro is executed, which is the next step after the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.

The question specifies that the sequence of TTPs occurred after the initial masquerading activity (which is part of Initial Access) and before the malicious macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word. The initial masquerading activity is part of the Initial Access phase, and the next step before the execution of the malicious macro is the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
