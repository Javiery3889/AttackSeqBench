Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear-phishing to gain initial access to target networks.
   - **Execution:** APT28 uses spear-phishing to deliver exploit documents that deploy malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 evades defenses using various methods.
   - **Credential Access:** APT28 harvests credentials through spear-phishing and fake login pages.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT28 used spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages and before they exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into the victim networks.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic is directly related to the harvesting of credentials through spear-phishing, which is mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access within the network, which would typically occur after gaining initial access and having credentials.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic is more about developing tools and resources, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another, which would occur after gaining access and having credentials.

Given the sequence described in the CTI outline, the step after harvesting credentials would be the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain deeper access. Therefore, the most plausible sequence would be:

- **Credential Access (B)** (harvesting credentials)
- **Exploitation of vulnerabilities (not directly listed but implied)**
- **Lateral Movement (D)** (moving deeper into the network)

Since the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurs after harvesting credentials and before exploiting vulnerabilities, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
