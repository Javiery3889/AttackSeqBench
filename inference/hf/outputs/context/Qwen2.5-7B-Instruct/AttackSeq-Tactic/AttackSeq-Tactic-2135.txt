Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a series of TTPs used by APT15 in their cyber attack. Here is the sequence of TTPs as per the outline:

1. **Initial Access**: Compromised over 30 hosts from May 2016 to late 2017.
2. **Execution**: Deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings.
5. **Credential Access**: Used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
6. **Collection**: Used various tools to extract data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently and uses DNS to communicate.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **RoyalDNS Backdoor Deployment**: This is part of the **Execution** phase.
- **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the network. Since RoyalDNS installs persistently, it aligns with the **Persistence** tactic.
- **Resource Development**: This is about developing tools or resources, which is not directly related to the deployment of a backdoor.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This is about gaining higher-level access, which occurred earlier using Mimikatz.
- **Exfiltration**: This is about stealing data, which is part of the **Collection** phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The RoyalDNS backdoor is deployed as part of the **Execution** phase.
- The question asks what happened after the deployment of RoyalDNS, which installs persistently.
- **Persistence** is the tactic that describes maintaining access to the network, which fits the description of RoyalDNS.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
