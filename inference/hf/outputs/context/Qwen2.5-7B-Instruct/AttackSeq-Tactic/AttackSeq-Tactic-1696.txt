Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Shamoon malware was deployed.
2. **Execution**: The malware executes and drops a driver.
3. **Persistence**: The malware entrenches itself as a service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware overwrites data and disk boot records.
5. **Command and Control**: Detection rules for Shamoon malware are developed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Shamoon malware overwrote the disk's boot records, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR), preventing access to the affected file systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the malware establishing a connection to a remote server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. The CTI outline mentions that Fidelis researchers developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware, including C2 communication. However, this is not directly related to the action of overwriting the boot records.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the malware running on the system. The malware has already executed and dropped a driver, so this is not the next step.
- **Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect the malware has on the system. Overwriting the boot records and preventing access to file systems is a form of impact.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the malware detecting and evading detection mechanisms. The malware's actions of overwriting the boot records do not directly relate to discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already executed and dropped a driver.
- The malware then overwrites the disk's boot records, including the MBR and VBR, which is a form of impact.
- The next logical step would be the actual damage or effect on the system, which is the impact.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the malware overwrites the disk's boot records is the **Impact** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
