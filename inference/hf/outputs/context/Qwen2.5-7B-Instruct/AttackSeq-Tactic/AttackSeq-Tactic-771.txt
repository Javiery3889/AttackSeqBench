Let's follow the steps to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the provided CTI outline.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks.
2. **Resource Development**: They have advanced capabilities to compromise trusted commercial network resources.
3. **Initial Access**: They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sharing sites.
4. **Execution**: Deploy various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers.
5. **Persistence**: Maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector virus.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt data.
7. **Collection**: Keylogger and information stealer modules collect secrets and credentials.
8. **Command and Control**: Maintain a web interface for victim management.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurs after the Darkhotel APT has evaded detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypted gathered data in log files. The TTP in question is the targeted collection of stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about evading detection and defense mechanisms, which is already covered in the CTI outline.
- **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system, which is also covered in the CTI outline.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another, which is not directly related to the collection of secrets and credentials.
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials, which aligns with the collection of secrets and credentials from browsers and email services.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Darkhotel APT uses keyloggers and information stealers to collect various secrets, including cached passwords and credentials from multiple browsers and email services.
- The question specifically asks about the TTP that follows the evasion of detection and encryption of data, which is the collection of secrets and credentials.
- Among the given answer choices, **Credential Access** (D) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the collection of secrets and credentials.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
