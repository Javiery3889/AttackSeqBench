Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - **Execution:** CosmicDuke uses a loader that was updated in mid-April 2014.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
   - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - **Command and Control:** CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltration and updates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware. This aligns with the Command and Control (T1071) tactic.
   - The question asks what happened after these actions, which logically would be the next step in the attack lifecycle, which is typically Exfiltration (T1040).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The CTI outline and the question both point to the actions of CosmicDuke after it has established Command and Control. The next logical step is to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the Exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
