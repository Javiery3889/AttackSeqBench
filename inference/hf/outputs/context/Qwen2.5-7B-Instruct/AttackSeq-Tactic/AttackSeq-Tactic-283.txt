Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The outline mentions the development and sale of PoS and ATM skimmers, which are part of the **Resource Development** tactic.
   - It also discusses the use of social engineering toolkits and the thriving carding enterprise, which are part of the **Social Engineering** and **Impact** tactics, respectively.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the **Reconnaissance** tactic, but it does mention the use of leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering, which is a key component of the **Reconnaissance** tactic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after cybercriminals leveraged leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering.
   - This implies that the intelligence gathered through SheYun would be used for a subsequent step in the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves the direct effect of the attack, such as data loss, system disruption, or financial loss. While it is a critical step, it is not directly related to the use of intelligence gathered through SheYun.
   - **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While it is a critical step, it is also not directly related to the use of intelligence gathered through SheYun.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves the development and acquisition of tools and resources. While it is a critical step, it is not directly related to the use of intelligence gathered through SheYun.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This tactic involves the gathering of information about the target. The use of SheYun for intelligence gathering is a clear example of reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of SheYun for intelligence gathering is a form of reconnaissance.
   - After gathering intelligence, the next logical step would be to use that intelligence to carry out the attack.
   - The outline does not mention any specific exfiltration or impact steps directly following the reconnaissance, but it does mention the development and sale of skimmers, which is part of the **Resource Development** tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the CTI outline and the question, is that the reconnaissance step (using SheYun) would be followed by the development and sale of skimmers, which is part of the **Resource Development** tactic.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Resource Development**.

Final Answer: C: Resource Development
