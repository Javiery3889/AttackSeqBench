Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver the NanHaiShu malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes and writes JScript data to a file, and creates a VBScript to delete the original file.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the registry to ensure it starts automatically.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C&C servers using HTTP POST and GET requests, initially using US IP addresses but switching to a Chinese IP address on October 26th, 2015.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the malware communicated system information to its C&C servers through HTTP POST requests and switched to a Chinese IP address for dynamic DNS-based Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the target's network and systems. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific actions of communicating with C&C servers.
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, and infrastructure to support the attack. This could include setting up C&C servers, but it is not the immediate action before communication.
   - **Collection:** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target's network or systems. This is a critical step before communicating with C&C servers, as the malware needs to gather system information to send to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels to direct the compromised system. This is the action that occurs after the malware has already communicated with the C&C server.

Given the sequence of events, the malware must first gather information (Collection) before it can communicate with the C&C server (Command and Control).

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
