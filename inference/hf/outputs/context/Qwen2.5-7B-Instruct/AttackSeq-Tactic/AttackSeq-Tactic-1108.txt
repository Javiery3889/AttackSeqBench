Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The CTI outline describes a scenario where attackers obfuscated their malicious code by appending it to the end of the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file and using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding. This is a tactic to evade detection, which falls under the **Defense Evasion** MITRE ATT&CK tactic.
   - The outline also mentions that the attackers used IP address whitelisting and selectively exploited a specific IP address (176.58.101.24) to communicate with their command and control server, which is a form of **Command and Control**.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.
   - The key part of the question is the modification of the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file, which aligns with the obfuscation technique described in the CTI outline.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic is more about establishing and maintaining control over a target, which is not directly related to the obfuscation of the code.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis, which directly matches the obfuscation of the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing and maintaining resources for the attack, which is not directly related to the obfuscation of the code.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The CTI outline clearly describes the use of obfuscation techniques to evade detection, which is a key component of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the attackers gained access to the CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file is **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
