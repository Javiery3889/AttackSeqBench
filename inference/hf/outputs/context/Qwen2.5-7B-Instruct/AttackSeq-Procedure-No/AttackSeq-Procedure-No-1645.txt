### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Shamoon malware was deployed and executed as a scheduled job.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and executes the entrenched file, resulting in a dropped driver.
   - **Persistence:** Shamoon entrenches itself as a service on the infected system.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware has a method for command and control communication.
   - **Impact:** The malware overwrites data on disks, targeting user data first, then system data, and eventually overwriting the disk's boot records.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after overwriting the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic, the malware will execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Shamoon malware executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver for disk access.
   - The VBR overwrite is mentioned as part of the impact, but it is not directly linked to the execution sequence described in the question.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question (executing a copy of itself as a scheduled job and dropping a driver) aligns with the execution phase of Shamoon malware as described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the detailed analysis of the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after Shamoon malware overwrites the Volume Boot Record, it will indeed execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
