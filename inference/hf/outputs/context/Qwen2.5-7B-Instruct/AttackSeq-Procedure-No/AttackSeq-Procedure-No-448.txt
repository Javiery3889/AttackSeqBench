Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection.
2. **Execution**: Deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. **Persistence**: Achieved persistence through webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells with obfuscation and the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' to update itself and delete traces.
5. **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts for lateral movement.
6. **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, awaiting commands for recon, file downloads, and self-deletion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files, Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities along with mapped drives and physical drive partitions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific data destruction activities or the deployment of CaddyWiper.
- The TTPs described in the outline focus on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
- There is no indication of any data destruction or wiping activities in the provided CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about data destruction or the deployment of CaddyWiper.
- The question introduces a new TTP (CaddyWiper) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no basis to conclude that Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction.

### Final Answer: B: No
