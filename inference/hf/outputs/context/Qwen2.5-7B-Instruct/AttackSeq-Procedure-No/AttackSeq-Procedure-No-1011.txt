Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents with macros to deliver payloads.
- **Execution**: The payload creates files in the ProgramData directory and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script, which is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- **Persistence**: The VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
- **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script uses obfuscation and the scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
- **Discovery**: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- **Collection**: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- **Others**: The attackers monitor the C&C server and use false flags in the script.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server.
- The outline does not provide any information about the encryption or communication methods used by the backdoor.
- The outline mentions that the attackers monitor the C&C server and use false flags, but it does not specify the communication method.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any direct information about the use of an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server.
- The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.
- Given the lack of specific information about the communication method, we cannot assume that the communication is encrypted.

### Final Answer: B: No
