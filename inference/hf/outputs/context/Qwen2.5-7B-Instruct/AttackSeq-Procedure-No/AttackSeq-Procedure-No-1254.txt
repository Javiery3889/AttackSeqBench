### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** BlueBravo uses spearphishing emails with malicious links to deliver malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware, such as GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton, includes anti-analysis techniques like API unhooking, dynamic API resolution, and sandbox evasion.
   - **Persistence:** BlueBravo establishes persistence through registry run keys and copying malicious ISO files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They employ various evasion techniques, including obfuscation, disabling or modifying tools, and hijacking execution flow.
   - **Command and Control:** BlueBravo uses HTTPS for C2 communication, often encrypted and Base64-encoded, and leverages web services like OneDrive and Dropbox.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention system checks for virtualized environments. However, it does highlight that BlueBravo uses anti-analysis techniques and defense evasion methods, which often include identifying and avoiding virtualized environments to evade detection.
   - Anti-analysis techniques, such as sandbox evasion, are designed to detect and avoid analysis in virtualized environments. This suggests that BlueBravo is aware of the presence of virtualized environments and may take steps to avoid them.

### Final Answer:
Given the context of BlueBravo's known tactics, which include anti-analysis techniques and defense evasion, it is highly plausible that they would perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
