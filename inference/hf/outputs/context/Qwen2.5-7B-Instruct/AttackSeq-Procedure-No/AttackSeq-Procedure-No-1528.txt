### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Use of DESLoader with DLL side-loading and fileless implants.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks to execute DESLoader.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Sophisticated techniques including fileless implants, DLL side-loading, and removal of event logs.
   - **Credential Access:** Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, use of administrator accounts, and tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting, using IP addresses for C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the A41APT campaign, after conducting discovery activities, will utilize compromised Azure credentials for lateral movement to on-premises systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Azure credentials or Azure services. The focus is on internal network scanning, use of RDP and SMB ports, and dumping credentials from AD servers, file servers, and backup servers.
   - The outline does not provide any indication of the campaign's use of Azure or Azure credentials for lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence or context suggesting that the A41APT campaign would utilize compromised Azure credentials for lateral movement to on-premises systems. The campaign's activities are more focused on internal network scanning and credential dumping from traditional on-premises systems.

**Final Answer: B: No**
