Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent to Indian embassies, containing weaponized RTF documents that dropped an embedded, encoded PE named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.
- **Command and Control**: The MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communicating with its C&C servers. Some of its modules, which lack C&C capability, rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, following the initial access achieved through weaponized RTF documents, the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through weaponized RTF documents.
- **Command and Control**: The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware utilizes a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication.

Given this information, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the details provided in the CTI outline. The malware first establishes initial access, then uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication, and subsequently downloads the full RAT component.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is achieved through weaponized RTF documents.
2. The malware then establishes command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
3. After establishing C&C, the malware proceeds to download the full RAT component.

Based on the CTI outline, the sequence described in the question is accurate and plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
