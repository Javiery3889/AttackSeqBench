### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Execution:** Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional files (syn.exe and 1.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Installation of the Milestone backdoor, which creates a service named msupdate2 and masquerades as Microsoft newdev.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creation of a new administrator user and execution of another instance of the backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, the Milestone backdoor is likely to communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a non-standard port for communication with the C2 server. However, it does state that the backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - The question is asking about a specific sequence of actions (system information discovery, screen capture, communication over a non-standard port, and then exfiltration over the same C2 channel).
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the use of a non-standard port for communication with the C2 server. The exfiltration is mentioned as occurring over the C2 channel, but there is no indication of a non-standard port being used.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the Milestone backdoor would communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel. The exfiltration is mentioned as occurring over the C2 channel, but there is no indication of a non-standard port being used.

**Final Answer: B: No**
