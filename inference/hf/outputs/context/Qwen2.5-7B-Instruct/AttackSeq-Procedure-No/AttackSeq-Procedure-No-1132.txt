Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack leveraged CVE-2015-5119 to execute a first stage downloader.
   - **Execution of First Stage Downloader:** The first stage downloader, a new variant of Sakula malware, was saved as "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" and executed.
   - **First Stage Downloader Behavior:** It writes another file at "%TEMP%/adobe.dat" and uses this file to retrieve a second stage PlugX file.
   - **C2 Infrastructure:** The second stage PlugX file connects to C2 domains starting with "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com."

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will use steganography to hide its C2 communications with domains such as "inocnation[.]com" or "oa[.]ameteksen[.]com" after the described attack sequence.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of steganography or any specific C2 communication methods beyond the domains starting with "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com."
   - The question introduces new C2 domains ("inocnation[.]com" and "oa[.]ameteksen[.]com") that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of steganography in the attack sequence.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no basis to conclude that the Sakula malware would use steganography to hide its C2 communications with the new domains mentioned in the question. The outline only describes the use of C2 domains starting with "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com."

**Final Answer: B: No**
