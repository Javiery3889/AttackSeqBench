### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), `rundll32`, `CreateProcess`, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and inserting malicious macros into documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, code signing, deobfuscation, and use of valid certificates.
   - **Discovery:** Automatic listing of interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macros to send emails to other targets.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after injecting malicious macros into accessible Word and Excel documents for lateral movement, it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search victim collaboration channels like MS Teams or Slack for sensitive information during the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of victim collaboration channels like MS Teams or Slack for information collection.
   - The outline focuses on lateral movement via injected macros and exfiltration of harvested documents.
   - The discovery phase mentions automatic listing of interesting files (e.g., Office documents) but does not indicate searching in collaboration channels.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of Gamaredon’s malware searching victim collaboration channels like MS Teams or Slack for sensitive information during the collection phase. The focus is on lateral movement and exfiltration through injected macros and harvested documents.

**Final Answer: B: No**
