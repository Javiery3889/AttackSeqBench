Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline describes a sophisticated supply-chain attack where SolarWinds was compromised, and a custom backdoor, Sunburst, was deployed. This initial access allowed for further exploitation.
- **Further Exploitation**: The outline does not explicitly mention the communication protocol used by the Sunburst backdoor before initial access is achieved. However, it does not provide any information suggesting that the Sunburst backdoor communicates with a C2 server before initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that the Sunburst backdoor was deployed as part of an initial access attack. There is no mention of any communication with a C2 server before this initial access.
- **Communication Protocol**: The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved. Given the information provided, there is no indication that the Sunburst backdoor communicates with a C2 server before the initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the Sunburst backdoor communicating with a C2 server before the initial access.
  - The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved, which is not supported by the provided information.
- **Final Answer**: Based on the lack of evidence in the CTI outline supporting such a communication before initial access, the most plausible answer is that the Sunburst backdoor does not communicate with its C2 server using a protocol before the initial access is achieved.

Final Answer: B: No
