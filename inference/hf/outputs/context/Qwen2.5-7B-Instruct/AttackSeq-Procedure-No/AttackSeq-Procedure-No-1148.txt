### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The CTI report mentions the use of masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
     - Specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys were used to find publicly available resources of these organizations.
     - The report highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using tools like masscan and search engines, the cybercriminals collected the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture of an infected host.
   - The key point here is the collection of detailed information about the target systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report focuses on the initial reconnaissance phase, where the primary goal is to identify potential entry points and gather information about the target network and systems.
   - The use of masscan and search engines like Shodan and Censys suggests that the cybercriminals are looking for specific details about the network infrastructure and systems.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the cybercriminals collected the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture, the nature of the reconnaissance activities (identifying non-trivial ports and services) implies that they would likely gather as much detailed information as possible about the target systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the reconnaissance phase and the detailed nature of the information gathered, it is highly plausible that the cybercriminals would collect the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture of an infected host.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the cybercriminals did indeed collect this information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
