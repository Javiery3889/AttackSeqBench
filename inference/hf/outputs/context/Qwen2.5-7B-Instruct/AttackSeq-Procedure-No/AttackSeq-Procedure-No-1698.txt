Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The attackers acquired infrastructure and developed capabilities.
2. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment were sent, exploiting CVE-2021-40444.
3. **Execution**: The Empire PowerShell stager was used to execute the Empire stager.
4. **Persistence**: Malicious content was executed via hijacked COM objects, and a local account was created.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager was used.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager, the adversaries are likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of secondary C2 servers. However, it does detail the use of Empire for execution and persistence.
- Reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) is a technique to evade detection by loading code into memory without writing to disk, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The use of secondary C2 servers is a common tactic to maintain persistence and evade detection by using multiple communication channels.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the initial attack vector (spear phishing), execution (Empire PowerShell stager), persistence (hijacked COM objects and local account), and defense evasion (reflective code loading).
- While the outline does not explicitly mention secondary C2 servers, it is a common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to use multiple C2 servers to maintain communication and evade detection.
- Reflective code loading is a technique to evade detection, and using secondary C2 servers would further enhance the attackers' ability to maintain communication and evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
