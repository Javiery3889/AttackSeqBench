### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (OST) such as SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework that operates almost entirely in-memory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 employed various techniques for privilege escalation, including the use of a custom version of the Potato family tools.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools to scan and map targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets instead of exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any watering hole attacks or zero-day exploits. The primary method of initial access described is exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - The reconnaissance phase involved using publicly available offensive security tools, which is consistent with the use of known vulnerabilities rather than zero-day exploits.
   - The persistence and privilege escalation methods described are sophisticated but do not indicate the use of zero-day exploits.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets instead of exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

**Final Answer: B: No**
