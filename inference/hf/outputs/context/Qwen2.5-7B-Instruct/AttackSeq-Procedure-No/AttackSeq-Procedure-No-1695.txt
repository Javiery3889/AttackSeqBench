Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx) and exploitation of CVE-2021-40444.
2. **Execution**: Abuse of PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for execution of the Empire stager.
3. **Persistence**: Establishment of persistence through hijacked references to COM objects and creation of a local account.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Use of reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal execution.
5. **Command and Control**: Creation of multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel and use of an existing, legitimate external web service for bidirectional communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems after acquiring infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question mentions "after acquiring infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development." This implies a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was via spear phishing emails and the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, which is the first step in the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly states that the initial access was via spear phishing emails and the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, which is the first step in the attack sequence.
- The question asks if this is likely to be the case after acquiring infrastructure, which is a later stage.
- The CTI outline does not mention acquiring infrastructure as a separate step before the initial access.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is that the spear phishing emails and exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 are the initial steps and not a later stage after acquiring infrastructure.

### Final Answer: No
