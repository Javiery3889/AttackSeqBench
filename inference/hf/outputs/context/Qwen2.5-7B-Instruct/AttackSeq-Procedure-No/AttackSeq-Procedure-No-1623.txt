### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The DNSpionage campaign involved detailed reconnaissance, targeting Lebanon and the UAE, focusing on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline. The attackers used spear-phishing via email or social media platforms to distribute malicious documents.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was through malicious websites hosting job listings, which redirected to legitimate company sites. These websites were used to distribute malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes in two steps: decoding a PE file and renaming and executing it as a scheduled task.
   - **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses password-protected macros and classical string obfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** The malware retrieves the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses HTTP and DNS for C2 communication.
   - **Impact:** The campaign could intercept traffic and harvest credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the DNSpionage attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE, before leveraging fake websites and Let's Encrypt certificates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers conducted reconnaissance as part of the DNSpionage campaign, targeting Lebanon and the UAE. This reconnaissance involved understanding the victims' network infrastructure and using spear-phishing to distribute malicious documents.
   - The use of fake websites and Let's Encrypt certificates is mentioned as part of the resource development efforts, which likely came after the initial reconnaissance phase.

### Conclusion:
The CTI outline indicates that the reconnaissance phase was an integral part of the campaign, targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE. The use of fake websites and Let's Encrypt certificates is described as a later step in the campaign, not as a part of the initial reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: No**
