Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes an attack sequence that includes:
1. **Initial Access**: AURORA PANDA used a strategic web compromise (SWC) on the VFW website, leveraging a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with ZxShell malware.
2. **Victim Exploitation**: The malware used in this attack is ZxShell, and the attack is attributed to AURORA PANDA.
3. **Other Details**: The outline provides additional context about the use of a malicious iframe, the IP address 173.252.252.204, and the domains used in the attack. It also mentions the use of Sakula malware and the presence of specific domains in the "hosts" file.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that after the initial access and infection with ZxShell malware, the victim exploitation will use BUSHWALK to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that AURORA PANDA used a SWC on the VFW website to deliver ZxShell malware.
- **Victim Exploitation**: The question asks about a specific TTP (BUSHWALK) and a specific module (DSUserAgentCap.pm) on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. However, the CTI outline does not mention any use of BUSHWALK or any modifications to the DSUserAgentCap.pm module.
- **Context and Similarities**: The CTI outline focuses on the use of ZxShell malware, the exploitation of a zero-day, and the use of specific domains. It does not provide any information about the use of BUSHWALK or any modifications to Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that suggests the use of BUSHWALK or any modifications to the DSUserAgentCap.pm module.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (BUSHWALK) and a specific module (DSUserAgentCap.pm) that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the lack of any relevant information in the CTI outline, it is highly unlikely that BUSHWALK was used in this attack.

### Final Answer: No
