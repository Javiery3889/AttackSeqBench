Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report details the following TTPs:
1. **Resource Development**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
3. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creating registry Run key entries and installing as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Injecting encrypted shellcode and adjusting token privileges.
7. **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.
8. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access**: The CTI report does not mention any specific TTPs related to dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
- **Discovery**: The CTI report explicitly states that SparrowDoor collects system information and probes files as part of the Discovery phase.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report does not indicate that FamousSparrow uses Mimikatz for credential access. The Discovery phase is clearly defined and includes the collection of system information and probing of files.
- The question suggests a sequence where Credential Access happens before Discovery, which is not supported by the CTI report.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Discovery happens independently of any specific Credential Access TTPs mentioned.

**Final Answer: No**
