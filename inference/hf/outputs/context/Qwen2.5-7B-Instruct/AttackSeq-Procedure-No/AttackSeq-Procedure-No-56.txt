### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with personal information to gain initial access.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - **Execution:** The malware, ThreatNeedle, was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
   - **Persistence:** The malware was implanted to achieve persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques were used to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** A credential harvesting tool named Responder was used.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.
   - **Collection:** Data was archived for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 infrastructure involved multiple servers and a compromised router.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Lazarus ensured web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention ensuring web servers are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware.
   - The outline focuses on the initial access through spear-phishing, execution of malware, and lateral movement using network commands and tools like WMIC.
   - There is no specific mention of checking or ensuring web servers are Internet accessible.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence that Lazarus ensured web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it. The focus is more on the initial access and subsequent lateral movement within the network.

**Final Answer: B: No**
