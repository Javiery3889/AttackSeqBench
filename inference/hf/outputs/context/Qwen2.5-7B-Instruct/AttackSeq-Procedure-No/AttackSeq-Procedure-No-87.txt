Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Vyveva backdoor. Here are the relevant TTPs:

- **Discovery**: 
  - Obtains file and directory listings (T1083)
  - Obtains the local IP address (T1016)
  - Obtains system time and time zone (T1124)

- **Command and Control**: 
  - Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
  - Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
  - Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

- **Exfiltration**: 
  - Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of actions after obtaining file and directory listings, the local IP address, and the system time and time zone. The specific TTPs mentioned are:
- Discovery: Obtaining file and directory listings, local IP address, and system time and time zone.
- Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data to the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva's backdoor will exfiltrate files to the C&C server only before compressing them. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This implies that the backdoor will exfiltrate files to the C&C server and then compress them.
- **B: No**
  - This implies that the backdoor will not exfiltrate files to the C&C server before compressing them.

### Step 4: Reasoning
Based on the CTI outline, the backdoor's TTPs for exfiltration (T1041) are clearly stated as exfiltrating data to the C&C server. There is no mention of compression as a separate step before exfiltration. The CTI outline does not provide any information suggesting that the backdoor compresses files before exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include compression before exfiltration. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
