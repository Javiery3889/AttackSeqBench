### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 uses external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing a local HTTP server with BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 is likely to use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that FIN13 uses external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. It also mentions that they use persistence methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and malware like SIXPACK.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the CTI outline, as it suggests that after establishing a local HTTP server with BLUEAGAVE (a persistence method), FIN13 would still use external servers for initial access.

### Final Answer:
The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses both persistence methods and initial access methods. Therefore, it is plausible that after establishing persistence with BLUEAGAVE, they would still use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
