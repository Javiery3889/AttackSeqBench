Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The actors used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to deliver Trojans and RATs.
2. **Resource Development**: Developed a toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs, and used Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload.
3. **Initial Access**: Gained access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
4. **Execution**: Executed malicious code through Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, and RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal infrastructure, but lapses revealed connections to an individual involved in the campaign.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM actors would utilize OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic after gaining initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The outline clearly states that the actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
- **Execution**: The execution phase involves the use of Trojans and RATs to execute malicious code.
- **Defense Evasion**: The outline mentions the use of WHOIS protection services to conceal infrastructure, but does not mention the use of OpenSSL for C2 traffic encryption.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of OpenSSL for C2 traffic encryption.
- The question asks about a specific technique (OpenSSL for C2 traffic encryption) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- The outline focuses on the use of Trojans, RATs, and exploitation of vulnerabilities, but does not include any information about encryption techniques like OpenSSL.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that ProjectM actors would utilize OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic.

### Final Answer: B: No
