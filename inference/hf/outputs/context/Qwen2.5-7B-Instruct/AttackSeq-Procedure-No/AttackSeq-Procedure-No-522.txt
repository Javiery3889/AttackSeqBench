Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The attack utilized a vulnerability exploit (CVE-2017-0199) through a Word document.
2. **Persistence**: The Helminth Trojan agent achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The Helminth Trojan agent used various evasive mechanisms.
4. **Credential Access**: The attack used a customized Mimikatz script to gather information.
5. **Command and Control**: The DnE1.Ps1 file communicates with a C&C server using DNS exchange queries.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the attack employed a worm infection strategy using a removable device to breach a secure network environment before achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention a worm infection strategy or the use of a removable device.
- The attack starts with a Word document exploit (CVE-2017-0199) and then achieves persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
- There is no indication of a worm infection or the use of a removable device in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was through a Word document exploit (CVE-2017-0199).
- The persistence mechanism is described as adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
- There is no mention of a worm infection or the use of a removable device in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the attack did not employ a worm infection strategy using a removable device to breach a secure network environment.

**Final Answer: No**
