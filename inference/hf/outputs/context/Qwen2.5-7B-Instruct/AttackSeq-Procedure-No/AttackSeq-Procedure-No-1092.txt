### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - **Execution:** Silent code execution via a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882 (T1204 - User Execution)
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - File Deletion (T1107)
     - Hidden Files and Directories (T1158)
     - Software Packing (T1045)
   - **Collection:** Data from local system (T1005)
   - **Command and Control:** Data sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043 - Commonly Used Port, T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol)
   - **Exfiltration:** Data encrypted before exfiltration (T1002)

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using software packing and deleting the original file, SWEED's malware (educrety.exe) will sniff network traffic to collect credentials before dropping a PE file.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any network traffic sniffing or credential collection as part of the attack sequence.
   - The defense evasion techniques mentioned include file deletion and software packing, but there is no indication of network traffic sniffing or credential collection.
   - The malware's primary actions are described as collecting data from the local system and exfiltrating it, without any mention of network sniffing.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that SWEED's malware, educrety.exe, would sniff network traffic to collect credentials before dropping a PE file. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
