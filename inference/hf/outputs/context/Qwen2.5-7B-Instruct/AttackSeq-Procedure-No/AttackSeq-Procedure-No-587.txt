Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Gholee malware campaign used a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file.
2. **Execution**: The malicious Excel file, when enabled, creates and executes a PE file (NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll) using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware establishes C2 by communicating with a specific IP address using an expired digital certificate.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Gholee malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection only after the execution of the concatenated PE file using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any obfuscation or hiding mechanisms after the execution of the PE file.
- The execution phase involves creating and running the PE file, but there is no indication of additional obfuscation or hiding mechanisms at this point.
- The obfuscation and hiding mechanisms are more likely to be part of the malware's behavior after it has been executed and is running on the system, rather than during the initial execution phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about obfuscation or hiding mechanisms being employed after the execution of the PE file.
- The question asks if these mechanisms are employed only after the execution, which is not supported by the provided information.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not employ these mechanisms only after the execution.

**Final Answer: B: No**
