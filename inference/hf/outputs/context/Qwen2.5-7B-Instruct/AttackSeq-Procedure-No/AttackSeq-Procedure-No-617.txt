Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations in Turkey.
- **Initial Access**: Financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
- **Execution**: The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document.
- **Persistence**: The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on the victim's network.
- **Defense Evasion**: The Bankshot implant evades detection and can perform destructive actions.
- **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, after developing the Bankshot implants.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Hidden Cobra has targeted Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
- The Bankshot implant is a part of this attack sequence, and the exploit is used to gain initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that Hidden Cobra has used spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations.
- The development of the Bankshot implants does not change the fact that Hidden Cobra has already used this method to gain initial access.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that Hidden Cobra will continue to use this method to target Turkish financial organizations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
