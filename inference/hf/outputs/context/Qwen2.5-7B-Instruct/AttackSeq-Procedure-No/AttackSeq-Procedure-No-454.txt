Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The APT-TOCS attack used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts and a binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) to execute embedded malware.
2. **Execution**: The attack involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities and executing them in memory. Communication was via Beacon mode, with network heartbeat packages every 60 seconds, and data transmission via the Cookie field.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The attack pattern included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication to evade sandbox detection.
4. **Lateral Movement**: APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network using network projection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after APT-TOCS exhibits lateral movement, it is likely to communicate using removable media for command and control operations.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of removable media for command and control operations.
- The communication method described in the Execution phase is Beacon mode, which is a network-based communication method.
- The lateral movement is also described as network-based, using network projection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of removable media for command and control operations.
- The communication and lateral movement methods described are network-based.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that APT-TOCS would use removable media for command and control operations after exhibiting lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
