Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
2. **Execution**: Using scripting (Batch files, VBScript) and rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, and CreateProcess to execute payloads.
3. **Persistence**: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscation, modifying registry keys, and code signing.
5. **Discovery**: Listing interesting files for future exfiltration.
6. **Lateral Movement**: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
7. **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
8. **Exfiltration**: Uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using its Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, Gamaredon is likely to attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement**: The CTI outline states that Gamaredon uses Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.
- **Collection Activities**: The outline mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration. However, it does not explicitly mention collecting mail from accessed systems and servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that Gamaredon collects mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.
- The group's primary focus is on lateral movement and exfiltration of documents, not mail.
- The question asks about a specific activity (collecting mail) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that Gamaredon is not likely to attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
