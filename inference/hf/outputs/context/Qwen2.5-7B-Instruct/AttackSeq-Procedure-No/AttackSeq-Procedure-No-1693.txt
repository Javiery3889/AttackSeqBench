Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains and developed capabilities including malware and tools.
2. **Initial Access**: The adversaries initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
3. **Persistence**: The adversaries established persistence by executing malicious content and creating a local account.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The adversaries used reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
5. **Command and Control**: The adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel and used an existing, legitimate external web service for bidirectional communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attackers used a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
- **Persistence**: They established persistence by executing malicious content and creating a local account.
- **Defense Evasion**: They used reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
- **Command and Control**: They created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel and used an existing, legitimate external web service for bidirectional communication.

From the CTI outline, we can see that:
- Domains were acquired and used as command and control servers (Resource Development).
- Malicious components, including the Graphite malware, were developed (Resource Development).
- PowerShell was not mentioned as a tool used for executing the Empire stager.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components (Graphite malware) as part of the Resource Development phase.
- The Empire stager was used for command and control, but it was not mentioned that PowerShell was used to execute the Empire stager.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline does not support the idea that domains and malicious components were acquired and developed only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

### Final Answer: B: No
