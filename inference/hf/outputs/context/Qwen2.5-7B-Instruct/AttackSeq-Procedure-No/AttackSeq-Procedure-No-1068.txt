### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Macro-enabled template files for initial access.
   - **Persistence:** Replacing the default Microsoft Word template.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using RC4-encrypted strings and HTTP GET requests for decryption keys.
   - **Credential Access:** Extensive credential harvesting via phishing sites and Telegram 'grabber' tool.
   - **Collection:** Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data, storing it in a SQLite database and JSON format. The tool also allows for message deletion.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the collected data is likely divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection after being collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention dividing the collected data into fixed-size chunks or exfiltrating it in such a manner.
   - The outline states that the collected data is stored in a SQLite database and JSON format, and there is no indication of chunking or evasion techniques related to data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the collected data is divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. The data is stored in a SQLite database and JSON format, and the focus is on the collection and storage rather than the exfiltration method.

**Final Answer: B: No**
