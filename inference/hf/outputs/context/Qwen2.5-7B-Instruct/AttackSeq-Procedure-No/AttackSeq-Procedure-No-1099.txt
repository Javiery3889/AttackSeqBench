Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - Malicious PDF files containing exploits (CVE-2011-0611) are used.
   - Social engineering tactics disguise the executable as an image or document.

2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - The loader was updated in mid-April 2014, after MiniDuke started using it in mid-December 2013.

3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
   - The service steals credentials and copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32.

4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke targets various software and Windows credentials for stealing.
   - It steals credentials from multiple applications and the Windows system.

5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific files and patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - It targets non-English filenames, particularly those with 'sifr' and 'sifer.'

6. **Collection**: CosmicDuke collects information using keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
   - It also searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'

7. **Exfiltration**: The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.
   - FTP login credentials and the FTP folder structure are detailed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration**: The CTI outline clearly states that CosmicDuke collects information and then uploads it to remote servers via FTP.
- **WebDav**: There is no mention of WebDav in the CTI outline.
- **Collection**: The CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke collects information using keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing after persistence and credential access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention WebDav, so we can rule out that CosmicDuke uses WebDav for exfiltration.
- CosmicDuke exfiltrates information via FTP after persistence and credential access.
- CosmicDuke collects information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing after the exfiltration process.

Given the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline, CosmicDuke does not communicate with remote servers via WebDav and exfiltrates information via FTP after persistence and credential access, before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

### Final Answer: B: No
