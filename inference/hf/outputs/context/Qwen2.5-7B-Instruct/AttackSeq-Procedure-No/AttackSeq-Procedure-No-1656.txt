Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
2. **Execution**: The VBScript, when executed, downloaded and opened a .doc file.
3. **Execution**: The .doc file led to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution, after the described sequence of events.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware, after downloading and opening a .doc file, executed a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy.
- The question asks about the likelihood of the malware installing itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell.
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of cron jobs or any other method of execution besides PowerShell.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of PowerShell for the execution of the malware.
- There is no information in the CTI outline suggesting the use of cron jobs or any other method of execution.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use cron jobs instead of PowerShell, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of cron jobs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
