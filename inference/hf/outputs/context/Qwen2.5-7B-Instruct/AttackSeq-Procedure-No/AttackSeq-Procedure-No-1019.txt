Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The CTI report describes an initial access technique where a Turkish energy company's website was compromised through a supply chain attack and used in a watering hole attack targeting individuals associated with Turkish critical infrastructure.
- **Credential Access**: The report indicates that SMB credential-harvesting malware was used to facilitate credential access. This was observed in the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Energetic Bear will:
1. Compromise a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack targeting Turkish critical infrastructure.
2. Target software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components during the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that Energetic Bear used a supply chain attack to compromise a Turkish energy company's website and conduct a watering hole attack. This aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Targeting Software Suppliers**: The CTI outline does not mention any specific targeting of software suppliers for PLC components. The focus is on the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website and the broader targeting of news and information websites in the industrial sector.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline confirms the use of a supply chain attack to compromise a Turkish energy company's website and conduct a watering hole attack.
- The outline does not provide any evidence or indication of targeting software suppliers for PLC components during the reconnaissance phase.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align with the details provided. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: No**
