Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
2. **Resource Development**: Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain similar to Falcon Coin.
3. **Initial Access**: Financial organizations in Turkey are targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
4. **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The implant is designed to evade detection and persist on the network.
6. **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with three control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails containing the embedded Adobe Flash exploit, the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files before being executed via exploitation for client execution in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with an embedded Flash exploit.
- **Communication with Control Servers**: The CTI outline explicitly states that the implants (DLLs) communicate with three control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence begins with initial access via spear phishing emails.
2. The malicious Word document contains an embedded Flash exploit.
3. After the exploit is executed, the Bankshot implant is deployed.
4. The implant then communicates with the control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.

Given the information in the CTI outline, the Bankshot implant does indeed communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after the initial access is gained.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
