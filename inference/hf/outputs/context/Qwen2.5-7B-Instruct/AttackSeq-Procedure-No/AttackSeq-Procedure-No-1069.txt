Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper uses exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands through Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
2. **Execution**: The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and deletes itself. UserInstall.exe then drops and executes sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted configuration file.
3. **Persistence**: The backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file, decrypts it, and uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.
4. **Command and Control**: TClient, a backdoor, uses SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server. It decrypts its configuration with a 16-byte key and uses custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention a FakeRun loader. Instead, it describes the backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) dropping and executing sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted configuration file.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline is:
  1. Exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands through EQNEDT32.EXE.
  2. UserInstall.exe drops and executes sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted configuration file.
  3. The backdoor uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention a FakeRun loader, and the sequence of actions described does not include the use of a FakeRun loader.
- The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute a FakeRun loader after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. Based on the CTI outline, this is not supported.

### Final Answer: B: No
