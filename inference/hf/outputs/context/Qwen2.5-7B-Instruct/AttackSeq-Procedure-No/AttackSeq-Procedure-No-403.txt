Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites.
- **Persistence**: 
  - Creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe'.
  - Installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
  - Creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP that is not mentioned in the CTI outline: copying files to a special USB device before achieving persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states the persistence mechanism involves creating a file and a task, but it does not mention any steps related to copying files to a USB device.
- The question asks if Machete is likely to perform this action, but the CTI outline does not provide any evidence or context to support this.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the initial access and persistence mechanisms, which are clearly defined.
- There is no information provided about any USB device or file copying actions.
- The question introduces a TTP that is not supported by the given CTI outline.

Given the lack of evidence in the CTI outline supporting the copying of files to a USB device, the most plausible answer is that this TTP is not part of the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
