Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
2. **Exfiltration**: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: The CTI outline clearly states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Exfiltration**: The CTI outline also mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.
- **Proxy Usage**: The CTI outline mentions that FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. This indicates that they do use proxies for command and control, but the question is specific to whether they use proxies only after collecting and archiving data.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses proxies only after collecting and archiving data. However, the sequence of TTPs described in the outline suggests that the exfiltration process is a critical step that follows data collection and archiving.
- JSPRAT is mentioned as a tool for network traffic proxying, which is used for command and control, but it is not specified that this is only done after the data has been collected and archived.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses proxies only after collecting and archiving data. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
