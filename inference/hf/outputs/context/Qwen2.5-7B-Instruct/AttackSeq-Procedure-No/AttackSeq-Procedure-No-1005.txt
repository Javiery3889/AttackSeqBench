Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Persistence**: The group uses stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.
- **Command and Control**: The group deploys custom malware (WellMess or WellMail) for further operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the group is likely to deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific actions related to vulnerability scanning or deploying public exploits.
- The outline focuses on maintaining persistence through stolen credentials and deploying custom malware (WellMess or WellMail).
- There is no information provided about the group conducting vulnerability scans or deploying public exploits.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence to support the idea of the group conducting vulnerability scans or deploying public exploits.
- The group's primary focus, as described, is on maintaining persistence and using custom malware for command and control.
- The question's scenario (vulnerability scanning and deploying public exploits) is not aligned with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: No (B)
