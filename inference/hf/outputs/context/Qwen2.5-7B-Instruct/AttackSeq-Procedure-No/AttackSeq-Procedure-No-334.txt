Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The spyware was delivered via spearphishing emails with PDF files attached.
- **Command and Control**: The C&C servers were identified and their IP addresses were listed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the C&C servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific TTPs related to a portable FAT16 partition image or a hidden file system in the %TEMP% directory.
- The outline focuses on the initial access via spearphishing emails and the C&C infrastructure.
- The question introduces a TTP (using a portable FAT16 partition image) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of a portable FAT16 partition image or a hidden file system in the %TEMP% directory.
- The TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline are:
  1. Spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file.
  2. Communication with C&C servers.

- The question introduces a TTP that is not supported by the CTI outline.

Given the lack of supporting information in the CTI outline for the TTP mentioned in the question, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: No**
