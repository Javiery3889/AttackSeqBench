Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The report mentions that the initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
2. **Execution**: The malware, TDrop2, executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable from the system32 folder and then used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The TDrop2 malware used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. It also replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' to evade network security solutions.
4. **Discovery**: The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after conducting initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that after the initial access via spear-phishing emails, the malware performed discovery activities before executing the second-stage payload using process hollowing.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline is:
  1. Initial Access (spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables)
  2. Discovery (gathering system information and network views)
  3. Execution (using process hollowing to inject malicious code)

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the malware performed discovery activities after the initial access, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware would engage in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing. Based on the CTI outline, this is indeed the case.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
