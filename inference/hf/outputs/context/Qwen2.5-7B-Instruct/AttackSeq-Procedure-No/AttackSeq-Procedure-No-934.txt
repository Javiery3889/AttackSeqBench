### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Resource Development:** They have advanced capabilities in compromising trusted commercial network resources and maintaining a large, dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** Deploy various malware components including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers. They also use 0-day exploits.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use digital certificates and encryption techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** Target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** Encrypt and store data in log files.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems by replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version after deploying malware components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the `pam_unix.so` file or any persistence mechanism involving this file.
   - The outline focuses on various TTPs such as initial access, execution, and collection, but does not detail persistence mechanisms like modifying system files.
   - The Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated espionage tools and maintaining a large, dynamic infrastructure, but the specific method of replacing `pam_unix.so` is not mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no direct evidence or indication that the Darkhotel APT uses the `pam_unix.so` file for persistence. The outline focuses on other TTPs and does not mention this specific method. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
