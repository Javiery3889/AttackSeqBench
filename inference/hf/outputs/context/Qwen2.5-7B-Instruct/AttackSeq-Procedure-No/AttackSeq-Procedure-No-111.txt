### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with initial contact and compromising the target.
   - **Execution:** Malicious code is executed to enable further actions.
   - **Persistence:** Ensures ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Needed to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypasses detection mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Enables access to systems and data.
   - **Discovery:** Identifies relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Collects the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishes communication channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after installing additional persistence points, the attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of the systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - **Persistence:** Installing additional persistence points.
     - **Discovery:** Gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Exploiting remote services to move to other systems.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will only move laterally after discovering the relevant systems, users, and data. This aligns with the logical sequence of the attack phases, where persistence is established first, followed by discovery to understand the network, and then lateral movement to access other systems.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers would move laterally without the need for discovery, which is less likely given the structured nature of the attack phases and the need to understand the network before moving to other systems.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, is that the attackers will install additional persistence points, then discover the relevant systems, users, and data, and finally exploit remote services for lateral movement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
