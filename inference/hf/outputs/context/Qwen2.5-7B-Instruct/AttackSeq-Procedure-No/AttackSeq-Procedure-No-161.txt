### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware and uses tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses stolen credentials, including MSP credentials, to gain higher-level permissions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 will likely use compromised MSP credentials to gain higher-level permissions such as domain administrator after deploying tools like mimikatz or PwDump against a domain controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that APT10 uses credential theft tools such as mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - The outline also mentions that APT10 uses stolen MSP credentials to gain higher-level permissions, including administrator or domain administrator privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is clear that APT10 does indeed use stolen credentials, including MSP credentials, to escalate privileges to higher levels, such as domain administrator.

### Conclusion:
Final Answer: A: Yes
