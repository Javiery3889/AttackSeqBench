Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Malware is spread via a watering hole attack, exploiting a VBScript engine vulnerability.
2. **Execution**: The malware executes a multi-stage infection process, including downloading and running a DLL via PowerShell, checking for antivirus software, and exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
3. **Persistence**: The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to a specific directory and creating a Run registry key with a typo.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: The downloader exploits CVE-2015-1701 to acquire Local Privilege Escalation.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The first stage exits if it detects antivirus software.
6. **Discovery**: The SLUB backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parses it for commands, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to file.io.
7. **Collection**: The backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to file.io.
8. **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, using hardcoded authentication tokens to post messages and command results.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute, the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders only before posting download links to the Slack channel and then building CAB files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the SLUB backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to file.io.
- The question specifically mentions creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and then building CAB files, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any specific information about creating archive files of user's Desktop folders or building CAB files.
- The collection phase of the attack involves various commands, but the specific actions of creating archive files of Desktop folders and building CAB files are not mentioned.
- The question asks about a specific sequence of actions that are not supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
