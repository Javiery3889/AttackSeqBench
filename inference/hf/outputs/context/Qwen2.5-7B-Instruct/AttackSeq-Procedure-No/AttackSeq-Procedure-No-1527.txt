Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Use of DESLoader to execute payloads.
3. **Persistence**: Registration of scheduled tasks to load DESLoader.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Sophisticated techniques including fileless implants and removal of event logs.
5. **Credential Access**: Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using administrator accounts to deploy RDP.
6. **Discovery**: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
7. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network only before conducting discovery activities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that after gaining initial access, the attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports and used administrator accounts to deploy RDP to servers.
- The discovery activities include scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used RDP to deploy to servers and conduct discovery activities.
- The question specifically asks about the use of RDP for lateral movement targeting servers before discovery activities.

Given the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline, it is evident that RDP was used for both lateral movement and discovery activities. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the use of RDP for these purposes.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
