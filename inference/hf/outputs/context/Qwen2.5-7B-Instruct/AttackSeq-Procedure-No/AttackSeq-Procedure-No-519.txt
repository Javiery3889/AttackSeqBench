Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attack was delivered through a Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to install a fileless variant of the Helminth Trojan.
2. **Execution**: The .hta file was executed by `mshta.exe`, and the warning message was disabled.
3. **Persistence**: The Helminth Trojan achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' that executes a VBS file every 3 minutes.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The Trojan used various evasive mechanisms, including regenerating its signatures and using a sophisticated version of Mimikatz to gather information.
5. **Credential Access**: The attack used a customized version of Mimikatz to gather information from the computer and the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the Helminth Trojan uses a customized version of Mimikatz to gather information, the DnE1.Ps1 file will use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific use of DNS exchange queries or a DnE1.Ps1 file.
- The outline states that the attack used a sophisticated version of Mimikatz for credential access, but it does not indicate any further steps involving DNS queries or downloading additional scripts.
- The outline mentions that the C&C servers are still active, but it does not specify the method of communication or the exact sequence of actions after the initial Mimikatz execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that supports the use of DNS exchange queries or downloading a bat script after the Mimikatz execution.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the outline does not include any steps that align with the scenario presented in the question.

**Final Answer: No**
