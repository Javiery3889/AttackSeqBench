Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the attack sequence as follows:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader that was updated in mid-April 2014.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns.
6. **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
7. **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP related to the exfiltration phase:
- After searching removable drives and skipping certain file types, is CosmicDuke likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP?

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention compressing output data with a custom LZW implementation.
- The exfiltration phase (step 7) mentions that CosmicDuke uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP, but it does not specify any compression method.
- The question is asking about a specific detail (compression with a custom LZW implementation) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about compressing data with a custom LZW implementation.
- The question is asking about a specific detail that is not supported by the provided information.
- Given the lack of supporting evidence from the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke does not compress the data with a custom LZW implementation.

**Final Answer: B: No**
