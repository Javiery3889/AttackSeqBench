### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN8 uses BADHATCH, a backdoor, to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** Uses WMI event subscription to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Involves privilege escalation to SYSTEM user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses TLS encryption and masquerades communication.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses a script named `mimi.ps1` for credential dumping, likely related to Mimikatz.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses `wmic.exe` to create a process on the Domain Controller and execute the BADHATCH deployment script.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after performing credential dumping using a PowerShell script speculated to be related to Mimikatz and reading the memory of `lsass.exe`, the attackers are likely to perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention anti-sandboxing or anti-virtualization checks. However, it is common for advanced threat actors to employ such techniques to evade detection and analysis.
   - Anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks are standard practices for sophisticated threat actors to ensure their malware remains undetected by security tools and analysts.

### Final Answer:
Given the context of the attack and the sophistication of the threat actor (FIN8), it is highly plausible that the attackers would employ anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks to evade detection. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
