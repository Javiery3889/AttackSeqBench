Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script would communicate with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads would include GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial step involves phishing emails with embedded macros that execute VBS code.
- The VBS macro then executes an encoded PowerShell script, which is the next step in the attack sequence.
- The question specifically asks if the VBS macro execution is the only step before gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the VBS macro is the first step in the attack sequence, followed by the execution of the PowerShell script.
- The question asks if the VBS macro execution is the only step before gaining initial access. Based on the CTI outline, the VBS macro execution is indeed the first step, and it leads to the execution of the PowerShell script, which is a critical step in gaining initial access.
- The question does not contradict the CTI outline; it simply asks if the VBS macro execution is the only step, which is not the case as the PowerShell script execution follows.

### Final Answer: No
The final answer is: "Final Answer: No" because the VBS macro execution is not the only step before gaining initial access; it leads to the execution of the PowerShell script, which is a critical step in the attack sequence.
