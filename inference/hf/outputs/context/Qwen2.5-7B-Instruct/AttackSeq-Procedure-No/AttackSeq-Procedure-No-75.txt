### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is delivered via spear-phishing emails, and the dropper is a Dynamic Link Library that delivers another encrypted library.
   - **Execution:** The malware injects malicious code into explorer.exe, decrypts a spying library, and saves it to the user's temporary folder. It then copies itself to the System32 directory and creates a service for persistence.
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence by copying itself to the System32 directory and creating services with names like DriverManage, WebService, and WebClientManager.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware disables the system firewall and AhnLab firewall, and turns off the Windows Security Center service.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system and user names, systeminfo command outputs, keystrokes, and directory listings.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication occurs through a Bulgarian web-based free email server, mail.bg, using hardcoded credentials.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrates data, including system information, user-related info, and keystrokes, by encrypting it with RC4 and sending it to the attackers' email accounts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, the malware will only then gather information about the infected computer, including system and user names, for transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - According to the CTI outline, the malware gathers information about the infected computer, including system and user names, as part of its discovery phase. This information is collected before the exfiltration phase.
   - The question suggests that the malware would only gather system and user names after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents. However, the CTI outline does not support this sequence. The malware collects system and user names as part of its initial discovery phase, which happens before the collection of keystrokes and directory listings.

### Final Answer:
The malware does not wait to gather system and user names after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
