Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
2. **Defense Evasion**: Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, is used to hide behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
3. **Credential Access**: The group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from MS Exchange Server.
4. **Collection**: Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information, updates bot configuration, uploads/download files, and uses a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.
5. **Exfiltration**: Seaduke exfiltrates data via legitimate cloud services and performs secure file deletion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a specific TTP related to the command-and-control (C2) port calculation. The choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline does not mention any specific method for calculating the C2 port. The focus is on the malware's capabilities in terms of initial access, defense evasion, credential access, collection, and exfiltration. There is no information provided about how the C2 port is determined or calculated.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the method used to calculate the C2 port.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (calculating the C2 port) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Since there is no information in the CTI outline to support either answer, we must rely on the context that the CTI outline provides. The outline focuses on the operational capabilities of the Duke group, including their use of Seaduke for various tasks, but does not mention any specific method for calculating C2 ports.

Given the lack of relevant information in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the method of calculating the C2 port is not described and is not a part of the provided TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
