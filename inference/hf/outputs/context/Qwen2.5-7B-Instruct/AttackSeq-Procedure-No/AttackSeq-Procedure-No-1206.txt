### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI outline describes a sophisticated supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, where a custom backdoor named Sunburst was deployed.
   - **TTPs:** The outline does not explicitly mention the use of domain fronting as a communication method for the Sunburst backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor, after initial access, will communicate with its C2 server using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the Sunburst backdoor using domain fronting for communication.
   - Domain fronting is a technique often used by APTs to hide the true destination of network traffic, but the outline does not mention this specific TTP.
   - Given the lack of information in the CTI outline about the use of domain fronting, and the fact that the outline focuses on the initial access and the deployment of the Sunburst backdoor, it is reasonable to assume that the Sunburst backdoor may not use domain fronting for communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
