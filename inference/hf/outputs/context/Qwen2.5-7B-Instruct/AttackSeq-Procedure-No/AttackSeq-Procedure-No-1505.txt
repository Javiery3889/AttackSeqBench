Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the correct answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
2. **Initial Access**: RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising or visiting compromised sites.
3. **Execution**: Upon execution, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the use of proxy servers after the exploit server returns encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. The key points are:
- The exploit server returns encrypted exploit code.
- The question is about whether proxy servers will be used to make infections harder to detect.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, which aligns with the question's context.
- The use of an encrypted channel (RC4 algorithm) is a technique for establishing secure communication but does not directly relate to the use of proxy servers for evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, which is a form of defense evasion.
- The question asks if proxy servers will be used after the exploit server returns encrypted exploit code. Given the context, the use of proxy servers is a known tactic of RIG EK to evade detection, regardless of the encryption method used.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
