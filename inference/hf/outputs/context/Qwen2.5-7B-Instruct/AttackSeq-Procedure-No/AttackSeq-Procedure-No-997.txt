Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Longhorn uses a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
- **Discovery**: Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and includes detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
- **Command and Control**: Longhorn configures specific domain and IP addresses for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
- **Exfiltration**: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomizes communication intervals to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after infecting a target with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit, Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The malware is installed via a zero-day exploit.
- **Discovery**: The malware has detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities, which are part of its espionage-focused design.
- **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with C&C servers to avoid detection.
- **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates data at specific times and randomizes communication intervals to avoid detection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on the target system.
2. **Discovery**: Given that Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage, it is highly likely that the malware will perform system fingerprinting and discovery to gather information about the target environment.
3. **Command and Control**: After gathering information, the malware will establish a connection with the C&C servers to avoid detection.
4. **Exfiltration**: The malware will then exfiltrate the gathered information at specific times and randomize communication intervals to avoid detection.

Based on the CTI outline, it is clear that Longhorn's malware is designed to perform system fingerprinting and discovery as part of its espionage capabilities before establishing a connection with the C&C servers and exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
