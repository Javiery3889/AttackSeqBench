Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following attack sequence:
1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections begin with social engineering and document-based exploits.
2. **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain persistence.
4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials and exports certificates.
5. **Discovery**: CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns and non-English filenames.
6. **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav.
7. **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer.
- The outline focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
- The question introduces new TTPs (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers.
- The question introduces new TTPs that are not part of the described attack sequence.
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not include these additional TTPs, and there is no indication that CosmicDuke would use them after exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: No
