Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware (FinSpy) uses anti-analysis techniques, including a custom packer and a virtual machine to execute code.
- **Command and Control**: The initial shellcode downloads the second stage shellcode from a specified URL, which then executes the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document.
- **Exfiltration**: The second stage shellcode downloads the final payload and a lure document, then executes the payload and displays the lure document.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that BlackOasis will utilize AutoIt malware scripts embedded in Microsoft Office documents or malicious links before the Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of AutoIt malware scripts or malicious links before the Flash zero-day exploit is delivered.
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline starts directly with the delivery of a Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit.
- There is no indication of any intermediate steps involving AutoIt scripts or malicious links.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is via a Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit.
- There is no mention of any other TTPs such as AutoIt scripts or malicious links being used before the Flash exploit is delivered.
- The question asks if it is likely that BlackOasis would use these additional TTPs, but the CTI outline does not support this scenario.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of AutoIt malware scripts or malicious links before the Flash exploit is delivered.

**Final Answer: B: No**
