Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group in their cyber attack. Here is the relevant part of the sequence for lateral movement and data exfiltration:

- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers used Windows commands and the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts. They also compromised a router virtual machine to overcome network segmentation and access the restricted network segment.
- **Command and Control**: The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers for various stages, with the attackers configuring the Apache web server on a compromised router to use it as a proxy server between the organization's corporate and restricted segments.
- **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine to create a covert channel. The group also used a Trojanized VNC Uploader to upload data to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, the Lazarus group is likely to collect data from removable media devices before exfiltrating it through a custom tunneling tool.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of data from removable media devices as part of the attack sequence.
- The outline focuses on the use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, followed by the establishment of a command-and-control infrastructure and data exfiltration using a custom tunneling tool.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that the group collected data from removable media devices as part of their attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that the Lazarus group collected data from removable media devices as part of their attack sequence.
- The question asks if the group is likely to perform this action, but the CTI outline does not support this claim.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the group did not perform this action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
