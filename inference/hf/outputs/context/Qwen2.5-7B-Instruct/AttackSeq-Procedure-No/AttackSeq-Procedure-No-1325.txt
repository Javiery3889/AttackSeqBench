### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The malware is distributed through phishing emails, indicating initial reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained, embedding all necessary components.
   - **Initial Access:** The malware gains access via phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops and executes the information stealer DLL (Sayad).
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the registry to ensure it runs at startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses obfuscation and non-traditional methods to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals sensitive information, including credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system and application details.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a C2 server to upload data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - **Others:** Additional context about the threat actor and the nature of the malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to proceed with capturing screenshots after exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data, only after performing discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the malware performs discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host.
   - The malware then exfiltrates the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - There is no mention of the malware capturing screenshots as part of its data collection efforts.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, the malware's sequence of actions does not include capturing screenshots after exfiltrating the collected data. The malware focuses on reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, and discovery, but there is no indication of screenshot capturing.

**Final Answer: B: No**
