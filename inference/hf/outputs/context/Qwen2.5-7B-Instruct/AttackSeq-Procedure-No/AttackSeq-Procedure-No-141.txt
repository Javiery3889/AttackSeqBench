Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: 
  - July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
  - February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day.
- **Persistence**: 
  - February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
- **Credential Access**: 
  - July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through phishing domains during the same period (July to August 2011) when they leveraged the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.
- This indicates that the credential access activity was concurrent with the initial access, not after it.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the credential access (phishing domains) occurred in the same timeframe as the initial access (unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability).
- Therefore, the attack group did not use phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access; they did it simultaneously.

### Final Answer: B: No
