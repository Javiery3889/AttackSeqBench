Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems and is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
- **Execution**: 
  - On iOS 7, the XAgent app is fully functional, with its icon hidden and it runs in the background.
  - On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.
- **Command and Control**: 
  - The app sends information via HTTP using POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands.
  - Log messages are written in HTML and color-coded.
  - The C&C HTTP requests use a randomly generated URI based on a template.
  - The app can also upload files via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the XAgent app executes by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices, it is likely to use `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators for discovery before sending the gathered information, including processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to identifying Domain Administrators or using `net.exe` commands.
- The execution details are specific to iOS and do not involve Windows domain-related commands.
- The C&C communication is described as using HTTP and FTP, but there is no mention of using `net.exe` or identifying domain administrators.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the execution and C&C communication of the XAgent app on iOS devices.
- There is no indication of any TTPs involving Windows domain administration or the use of `net.exe` commands.
- The question introduces a TTP that is not aligned with the CTI outline's focus on iOS malware and its communication methods.

### Final Answer: No
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI outline does not include the use of `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` for identifying Domain Administrators. Therefore, the answer is "No".
