Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy APT group. Here are the key points relevant to the question:

- **Exfiltration**: The outline mentions that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. There is no mention of using Google Drive for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of Google Drive for exfiltration.
- The outline explicitly states that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about SideCopy using Google Drive for exfiltration.
- The outline clearly states that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltration.
- There is no indication that Google Drive is used as an exfiltration method in the provided information.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is not likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

### Final Answer: B: No
