Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack involved a spear-phishing email with a link to a Flash exploit hosted on `rpt.perrydale[.]com` and `report.perrydale[.]com`.
- **Execution**: The Flash exploit, named `show.swf`, contained ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload. The exploit leveraged CVE-2015-5119 and used techniques such as a use-after-free condition and shared functions from a previous attack (CVE-2015-3113).
- **Payload**: The Flash exploit retrieved a secondary payload, `b.gif`, from the same domains.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the Flash file `show.swf` will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any NTLM downgrade or hash capture techniques. The focus is on the exploitation of the Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) and the retrieval of a secondary payload from a GIF image.
- The ActionScript classes and techniques described are related to exploiting the Flash vulnerability and executing shellcode, but there is no indication of NTLM hash capture.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence or context suggesting that the Flash exploit (`show.swf`) would perform NTLM hash capture.
- The question asks about a specific technique (NTLM downgrade) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Flash file `show.swf` is unlikely to perform NTLM hash capture before installing the payload.

**Final Answer: No**
