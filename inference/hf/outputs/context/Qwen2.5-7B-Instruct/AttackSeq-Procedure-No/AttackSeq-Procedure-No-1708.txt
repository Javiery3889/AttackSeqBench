Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution:**
   - Malware (Black Energy 2) is detected as Backdoor.Win32.Blakken.
   - The malware hides its code using encryption and code compression.
   - It infects system processes.
   - Allocates virtual memory, copies its decryptor code, and passes control to the decryptor.
   - Places dropper functionality code in memory.
   - Creates a decryptor driver with a random name in the system32drivers directory.
   - Starts a corresponding service.
   - The driver acts as a wrapper for the malware's core components.

2. **Persistence:**
   - Injects a DLL into the svchost.exe user-mode process.
   - The infector driver locates the svchost.exe process, allocates memory in its address space, and launches the injected library's code using APC queue processing.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - Communicates with the C&C center through HTTP requests.
   - Receives a bot configuration file (encrypted XML document).
   - Can receive commands to download and execute files, update the bot, and set contact frequency with the C&C server.

4. **Impact:**
   - Primarily used for DDoS attacks.
   - Uses plugins like ddos, syn, and http to initiate mass connections and send random data packets.
   - Can create a significant load on servers, especially when using the http plugin.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Black Energy 2 will mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory while also removing on-disk artifacts after evading defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Mounting and Binding to `/proc/` Filepath:**
  - The CTI outline does not mention any specific TTP related to mounting or binding to the `/proc/` filepath. The malware's persistence and execution methods described do not include this behavior.
  
- **Removing On-Disk Artifacts:**
  - The CTI outline mentions that the malware hides its code using encryption and code compression, and it places dropper functionality code in memory. However, it does not explicitly state that the malware removes on-disk artifacts after evading defenses.

- **Encrypting Payload and Loading Plugins:**
  - The CTI outline does mention that the malware encrypts its payload and loads plugins directly onto the infected machine. This aligns with the question's description.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide evidence that Black Energy 2 mounts and binds to the `/proc/` filepath.
- The CTI outline does support the idea that the malware encrypts its payload and loads plugins directly onto the infected machine.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention removing on-disk artifacts, but it does describe the malware's ability to hide its code and place dropper functionality in memory.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath. The malware's behavior described in the CTI outline is more consistent with the other aspects of the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
