### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific use of the `enum_secrets` module or any AWS-related activities. The focus is on traditional methods of reconnaissance, such as using native OS binaries and third-party tools.
   - The CTI outline does not provide any indication that FIN13 uses AWS-specific tools or modules for reconnaissance.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that FIN13 uses the `enum_secrets` module or any AWS-related tools for reconnaissance. The outline clearly states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries and other traditional methods for gathering information on network and host configurations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
