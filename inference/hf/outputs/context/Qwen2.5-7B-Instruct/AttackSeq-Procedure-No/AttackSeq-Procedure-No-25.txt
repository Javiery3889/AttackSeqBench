### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing using legitimate-looking documents.
   - **Execution:** Downloader installed the backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed obfuscation, packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Targeted credentials by scanning for key and certificate files.
   - **Discovery:** Conducted network and system discovery.
   - **Collection:** Collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes.
   - **Command and Control:** Used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C&C servers, with fallback channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting data, the malware exfiltrated encrypted data to remote servers before using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exfiltration of data before using FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication. However, it does state that the malware collected data and then used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline suggests that data collection and exfiltration are part of the same process, with no indication of an intermediate step of exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers before using C&C communication channels.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to support the idea that the malware exfiltrates encrypted data to remote servers before using FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication. The outline indicates a direct sequence from data collection to C&C communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
