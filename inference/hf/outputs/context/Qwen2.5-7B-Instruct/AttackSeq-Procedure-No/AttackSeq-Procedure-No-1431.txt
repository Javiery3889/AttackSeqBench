Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software.
3. **Persistence**: The malware persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including daemonizing and detaching from the 3CX process, deleting itself from disk, and writing configuration files to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
5. **Discovery**: The malware collects information from the victim machine.
6. **Collection**: The malware stages and collects data from the victim machine.
7. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after automatically exfiltrating collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request, the Smooth Operator malware is likely to establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we know that the malware's C2 communication is described in the "Command and Control" section. Specifically, it states:
- **Command and Control**: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

The question aligns with this description, as it mentions HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, which are both part of the malware's C2 communication strategy.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The CTI outline clearly states that the malware uses HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm for C2 communication.
2. The question asks if the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation after exfiltrating data.
3. The answer choices are:
   - A: Yes
   - B: No

Given the information in the CTI outline, the correct answer is that the malware will indeed establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
