### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** The APT group uses DLL side-loading to execute a malicious payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group uses a clean loader (e.g., renamed Microsoft antivirus component or DISM.EXE) to load a malicious DLL that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload. The payloads are encrypted using a simple XOR algorithm.
   - **Exfiltration:** The group configures the system for data exfiltration by creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder and copying files to this folder.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the attack's final payload will use secondary C2 servers for communication before connecting back to the command and control server at IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999 for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of secondary C2 servers. It focuses on the execution, defense evasion, and exfiltration techniques used by the APT group.
   - The question introduces a new element (secondary C2 servers) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the attack's final payload uses secondary C2 servers for communication. The outline does not mention any such tactic.

**Final Answer: B: No**
