### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Adversaries use worms and scanning tools (e.g., masscan) to detect and infect new hosts.
     - They use public search engines (e.g., Shodan, Censys) and scripts (e.g., DOCKERGEDDON) to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
     - They collect information about the host and deploy malicious containers.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports.
     - Created public registry accounts mimicking popular software to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - Massive attacks against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, where crypto miners were executed during the auto-build process.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow and gain persistency.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys to open backdoors.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software to avoid detection.
     - Used obfuscated files or information to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials over the C2 server.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives such as backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft are emerging.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages for delivery to or retrieval by victims during the Resource Development phase after using functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of npm packages or Resource Development phase. However, the context of the attack suggests that adversaries are using various methods to gain access and maintain persistence, including creating public registry accounts that mimic popular software.
   - The use of public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images (e.g., Tesnorflow) indicates a strategy to deliver malicious payloads through trusted channels.
   - While the outline does not directly mention npm packages, the strategy of mimicking popular software and using public registries aligns with the idea of developing and delivering malicious packages through trusted channels.

### Final Answer:
Given the context and the strategy of mimicking popular software to deliver malicious payloads, it is plausible that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages for delivery to or retrieval by victims during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
