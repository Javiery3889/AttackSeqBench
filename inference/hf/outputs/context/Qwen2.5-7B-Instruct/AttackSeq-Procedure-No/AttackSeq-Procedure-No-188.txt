### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops and uses various tools including Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.
   - **Execution:** Uses Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession for execution.
   - **Persistence:** Uses WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Elevates privileges using native tools like vssadmin.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Minimizes detection by deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Collects credentials and password hashes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Leverages Wmiexec and net commands.
   - **Collection:** Uses custom batch scripts to collect files into archives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uses RCSession and Cobalt Strike for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after using scripts to collect files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for C2 communication.
   - The outline focuses on the use of Cobalt Strike and RCSession for exfiltration, which are more likely to be used for C2 communication.
   - BRONZE PRESIDENT is known to use sophisticated tools and methods for C2, and Cobalt Strike is a widely used and highly flexible tool that can be configured to use various protocols, including FTP, for C2 communication.
   - However, the question specifically asks about the use of FTP after collecting files, and the CTI outline does not provide any direct evidence of FTP being used for C2.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of BRONZE PRESIDENT using FTP for C2 communication. The outline suggests the use of Cobalt Strike and RCSession for exfiltration, which are more likely to be used for C2. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
