### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with initial contact and compromising the target.
   - **Execution:** Malicious code is executed to enable further actions.
   - **Persistence:** Ensures ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Needed to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypasses detection mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Enables access to systems and data.
   - **Discovery:** Locates relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Collects relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishes communication channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after persistence is established, tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The CTI outline mentions that persistence points ensure ongoing access to the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The question asks about moving tools laterally, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** This is a technique where attackers use phishing to gain access to internal systems. However, the CTI outline does not mention spearphishing as a specific tactic.
   - **File Transfer:** Transferring files to a network share is a method of lateral movement, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that after persistence is established, tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that after persistence is established, tools will not be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.

### Final Answer:
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention internal spearphishing or the use of network shares for lateral movement. However, the outline does mention lateral movement as a tactic that can be used after persistence is established. Given the context and the fact that lateral movement is a common tactic in cyber attacks, it is plausible that tools could be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of internal spearphishing techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
