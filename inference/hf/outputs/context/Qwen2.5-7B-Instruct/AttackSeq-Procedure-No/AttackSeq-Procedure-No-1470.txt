Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods.
2. **Initial Access**: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign and deliver a BlackEnergy 3 RAT via weaponized MS Office email attachments.
3. **Credential Access**: Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery.
4. **Command and Control**: Malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled CC server.
5. **Impact**: Adversaries develop malicious computer code, deliver data destruction malware, and schedule various disruptions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of Ruby scripts for executing payloads. The outline states that the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is delivered via weaponized MS Office email attachments and installed after employees enable macros.
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of Ruby scripts in the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not support the use of Ruby scripts for executing payloads. The attack sequence described involves the use of MS Office attachments and macros.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (Ruby scripts) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
