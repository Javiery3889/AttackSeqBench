### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The threat actor uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with documents containing remote content and MS Word/PowerPoint documents exploiting specific vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals and uses resilient communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after stealing Google Chrome credentials and other data, the file-stealer module is likely to upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to collect them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention a file-stealer module or the specific behavior of uploading files with certain extensions.
   - The outline focuses on the backdoor stealing credentials and downloading additional malware, but it does not detail the exact behavior of the file-stealer module.
   - The question is asking about a specific behavior (uploading files with specific extensions) that is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the specific behavior described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
