### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish, a malicious JavaScript-based framework, to initiate the attack. This was delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, which led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of `Get-NetComputer` or PowerView for remote system discovery. Instead, it states that the initial access involved the SocGholish framework, which led to the execution of PowerShell scripts for discovery.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline is:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Use of SocGholish framework.
     2. **Initial Access:** Execution of JavaScript files by wscript.exe, leading to the download of additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Since the CTI outline does not indicate the use of `Get-NetComputer` or PowerView for remote system discovery, and the initial access is clearly described as involving the SocGholish framework, the answer is that it is unlikely the attackers would use `Get-NetComputer` for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework.

**Final Answer: B: No**
