### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware "Machete" is distributed through spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites, with the malware embedded in PowerPoint presentations disguised as self-extracting archives.
   - **Persistence:** "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - **Collection Phase:** The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any collection of files from information repositories during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if "Machete" is likely to collect files from various information repositories during the collection phase after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the initial access and persistence phases but does not provide any information about the collection phase.
   - The question is asking about a specific phase (collection) that is not detailed in the CTI outline.
   - The answer choices are binary: Yes or No.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - There is no information in the CTI outline to support the idea that "Machete" collects files from information repositories during the collection phase.
   - **B: No** - Given the lack of information about the collection phase, it is reasonable to assume that "Machete" does not perform this action based on the provided details.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
