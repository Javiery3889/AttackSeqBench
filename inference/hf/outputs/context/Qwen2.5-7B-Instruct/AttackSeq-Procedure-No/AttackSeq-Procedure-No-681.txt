Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
- **Execution**: Attackers abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
- **Persistence**: Adversaries used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow and gain persistency.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
- **Defense Evasion**: Adversaries removed security software to avoid detection.
- **Command and Control**: Attackers used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
- **Execution and Persistence**: Malicious containers are deployed and persistence is established.
- **Defense Evasion**: Security software is removed to avoid detection.

### Reasoning:
- **Detection During Initial Access**: The question implies that adversaries might use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance. However, the CTI outline does not mention any specific reconnaissance phase where such tools are used.
- **Deployment of Malicious Containers**: The CTI outline clearly states that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports and deployed malicious containers. This indicates that the initial access and execution phases are closely linked.
- **Defense Evasion**: After deploying malicious containers, adversaries remove security software to avoid detection. This suggests that the detection phase (using tools like DOCKERGEDDON) would occur after the initial access and execution phases, not during reconnaissance.

### Conclusion:
Given the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline, it is more plausible that adversaries would detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON after deploying malicious containers, rather than during reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: B: No
