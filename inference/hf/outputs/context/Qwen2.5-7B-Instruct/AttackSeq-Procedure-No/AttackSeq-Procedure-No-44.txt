### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing with links to compressed files or zipped files containing malicious content.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files/directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, packing, and masquerading of files and tasks.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate files and exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, and enumerating running processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication, with fallback channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any file size threshold or division of files before exfiltration.
   - The collection phase mentions stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder. However, there is no indication of file size thresholds or division of files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to support the idea that Machete divides files based on a specific size threshold before exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Machete does not perform such an action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
