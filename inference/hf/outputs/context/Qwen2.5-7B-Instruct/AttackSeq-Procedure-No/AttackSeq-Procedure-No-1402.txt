Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
2. **Persistence**: Uses various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions.
3. **Collection**: Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
4. **Command and Control**: Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
5. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, it is likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question suggests the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move malware across the network.
- **Data Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Fraudulent Transactions**: FIN13 targets specific data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 already uses native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
- **Lateral Movement**: The CTI outline does not mention the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. Instead, it focuses on persistence and data collection using custom malware and backdoors.
- **Data Collection**: FIN13 does collect data from network shared drives, but this is part of their established TTPs and does not require additional software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI outline, FIN13's TTPs do not include the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include this step.

Final Answer: B: No
