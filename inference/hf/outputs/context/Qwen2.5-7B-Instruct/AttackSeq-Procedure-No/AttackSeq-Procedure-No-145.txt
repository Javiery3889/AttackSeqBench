### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (SharpHound and PowerSploit) to perform reconnaissance by loading them directly into memory.
   - **Discovery:** This phase is essentially the same as the Reconnaissance phase, where TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, using the NodeIISWeb malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor would compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement only after establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention TG1021 compromising additional IIS servers for lateral movement. However, the context provided suggests that TG1021 has already gained initial access and established a sophisticated method of maintaining persistence and command and control.
   - The question implies a sequence where reconnaissance and discovery are completed, followed by establishing C2, and then lateral movement. The CTI outline does not provide evidence of TG1021 performing lateral movement after establishing C2.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of TG1021 compromising additional IIS servers for lateral movement after establishing C2. The outline focuses on the initial access, persistence, command and control, and defense evasion techniques but does not indicate any lateral movement beyond the initial target.

**Final Answer: B: No**
