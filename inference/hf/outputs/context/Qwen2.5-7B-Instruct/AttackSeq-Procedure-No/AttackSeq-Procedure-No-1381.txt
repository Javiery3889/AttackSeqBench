Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** They use JSPRAT for local command execution and file operations.
   - **Persistence:** They use various methods, including trojanized versions of KeePass.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use techniques like ProcDump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and use WMI for remote command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after moving laterally using WMI and custom web shells, FIN13 is likely to gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, which aligns with the question's mention of WMI and custom web shells.
   - The outline also states that FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential access, which aligns with the question's mention of obtaining credentials via these methods.
   - After obtaining credentials, the next logical step would be to gather information on services, which is a common practice in cyber attacks to understand the target environment better.

Given the context and the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, it is highly plausible that after moving laterally and obtaining credentials, FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
