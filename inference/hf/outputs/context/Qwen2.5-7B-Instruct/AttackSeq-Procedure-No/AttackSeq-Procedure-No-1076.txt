Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: 
   - The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).
   - UserInstall.exe uses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
   - The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launches dllhost.exe.
   - The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
   - Malicious documents are observed that do not need to download anything from the internet.

2. **Persistence**: 
   - The backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file and decrypts it.
   - The backdoor uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

3. **Defense Evasion**: 
   - Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
   - The installer drops files into the Apple/Update directory and creates a hidden directory (UFile).
   - The loader, named FakeRun, executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL file into this process.

4. **Command and Control**: 
   - TClient uses SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.
   - TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with a 16-byte key.
   - TClient uses custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that various social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of social media channels for spearphishing.
- The outline mentions that the system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) after a series of execution steps.
- The "Others" section provides context about the use of exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware, but it does not specify the use of social media channels.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the technical aspects of the attack, such as the use of DLL hijacking, the creation of hidden directories, and the use of custom SSL libraries for C&C communication.
- There is no direct mention of social media channels being used for spearphishing in the CTI outline.
- The use of exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents is mentioned, but this does not necessarily imply the use of social media for spearphishing.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that social media channels were used for spearphishing.

### Final Answer: No
