Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: 
  - July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
  - February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day.
- **Persistence**: 
  - February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
- **Credential Access**: 
  - July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
- **Command and Control**: 
  - May 2015: Attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure.
  - 2015: A number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromise a number of Japanese companies.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, following the attacks that leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access, the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that in July to August 2011, the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials.
- The question specifically asks about the period following the initial access via the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, which is the same period (July to August 2011).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that in July to August 2011, the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials.
- The question asks if the group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, which directly contradicts the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
