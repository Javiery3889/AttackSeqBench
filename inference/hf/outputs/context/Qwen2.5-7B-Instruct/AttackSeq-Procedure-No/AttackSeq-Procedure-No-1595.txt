Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: They use various malware types, including a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts.
3. **Persistence**: They repeatedly attack the same targets and use new techniques to maintain access.
4. **Defense Evasion**: They use various techniques to avoid detection, including fake identities and anti-debugging.
5. **Command and Control**: Infected computers communicate with a C&C server for further instructions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after establishing communication with a C&C server, Rocket Kitten will employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under the tactic of Credential Access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Rocket Kitten uses a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts.
- The keylogger is used to gain access to additional accounts, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) for capturing keystrokes and connecting to victims' Gmail accounts.
- This keylogger is a critical part of the attack sequence and is used to gain access to additional accounts, which falls under the Credential Access tactic.
- The question asks if Rocket Kitten will employ a keylogger after establishing communication with a C&C server, and the answer is clearly yes based on the information provided.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
