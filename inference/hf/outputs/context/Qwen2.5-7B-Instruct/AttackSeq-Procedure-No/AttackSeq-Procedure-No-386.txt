### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:** APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
   - **Persistence:** RoyalDNS installs itself persistently and communicates over DNS.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** RoyalCLI evades policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - **Credential Access:** APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
   - **Collection:** APT15 used various tools to extract data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 used valid account information (VPN credentials) to remotely access the network instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
   - The backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) are described as additional methods used by APT15 to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - The question implies a choice between using valid account information (VPN credentials) and deploying backdoors. Given the information provided, APT15 had both methods available and used them as part of their attack strategy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Since the CTI outline indicates that APT15 used both valid account information (VPN credentials) and backdoors, it is plausible that they used both methods to achieve their objectives.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that APT15 used valid account information instead of deploying backdoors. Given the context, it is more likely that APT15 would use the stolen credentials for direct access and use backdoors for maintaining persistence and evading detection.

### Final Answer: B: No
