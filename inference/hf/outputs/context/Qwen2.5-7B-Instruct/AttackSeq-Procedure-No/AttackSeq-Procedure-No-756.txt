Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
2. **Exfiltration**: The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance, it is likely that it communicated with the C2 (Command and Control) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data to the control server via HTTP POST requests. There is no mention of using blogs or WordPress for communication.
- The question asks about a specific method of communication (blogs and WordPress) that is not aligned with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline specifies that the Rising Sun implant communicated with the C2 server via HTTP POST requests, which is a standard method for exfiltrating data.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that the implant used blogs or WordPress for communication.
- Therefore, the answer choice that aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline is "No."

### Final Answer: B: No
