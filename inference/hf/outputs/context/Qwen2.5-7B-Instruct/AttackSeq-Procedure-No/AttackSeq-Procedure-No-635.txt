Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used a zero-day exploit (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome delivered through a waterhole attack on a Korean-language news portal.
2. **Persistence**: The malware installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware downloaded next stages from a hardcoded C2 server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if attackers utilized heap spraying techniques before inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any heap spraying techniques or any other technique used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive before the initial access.
- The initial access is described as leveraging a zero-day exploit (CVE-2019-13720) directly in the browser, which is a common method for exploiting vulnerabilities without needing heap spraying.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report does not provide any information about the use of heap spraying techniques.
- The initial access method described is a direct exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in the browser.
- There is no indication in the CTI report that heap spraying was used as a prerequisite for the exploit.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that heap spraying was not utilized as a technique before the initial access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
