Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - **Initial Access:** The document 'Richard_Johnson.doc' was used, and it contained VBS macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The PowerShell script executed in memory and used DCOM objects to avoid disk writes.
   - **Command and Control:** The script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
   - **Impact:** The downloaded payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access through phishing emails, a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the PowerShell script executed in memory and used DCOM objects to download payloads. However, it does not explicitly state that the COM object was used to gather system information before downloading the payloads.
   - The outline does mention that the script communicated with C2 servers to download payloads, which aligns with the question's second part about downloading payloads.
   - The question specifically asks about a COM object executing queries to gather system information, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the outline does not explicitly state that a COM object was used to gather system information before downloading the payloads. The outline focuses more on the execution of the PowerShell script and the use of DCOM objects for downloading payloads.

**Final Answer: No** (Choice B)
