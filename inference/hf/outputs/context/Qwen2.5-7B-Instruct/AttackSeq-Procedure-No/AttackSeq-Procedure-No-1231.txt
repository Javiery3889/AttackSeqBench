Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The Lazarus group deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) and backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
2. **Persistence**: The loader/spreader malware was placed in the C:\Windows\Temp directory and set to execute via a registry key. The backdoor malware was also used for persistence.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The group used the taskkill command to disable antivirus processes and employed a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file.
4. **Lateral Movement**: The loader/spreader malware was spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
5. **Command and Control**: The backdoor malware communicated with command and control servers and executed remote commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only after deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware. However, it does mention the use of backdoor malware for command and control communication and remote command execution.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline shows that the backdoor malware was used for command and control communication and remote command execution from the beginning of the attack, not after the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the backdoor malware was used for command and control communication and remote command execution from the start of the attack.
- The question asks if the backdoor malware was used for command and control communication and remote command execution only after deploying Hermes ransomware, which is not supported by the CTI outline.
- Therefore, the correct answer is that the backdoor malware was used for command and control communication and remote command execution before the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

**Final Answer: No**
