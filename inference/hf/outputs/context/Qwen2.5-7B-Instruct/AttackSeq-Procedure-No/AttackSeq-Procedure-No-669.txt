Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Adversaries use worms to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts.
     - Scanning tools like masscan are used to increase the frequency of scanning activity.
     - Public search engines like Shodan or Censys are used.
     - The script `DOCKERGEDDON` is used to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if, after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, it is likely that adversaries would then use `DOCKERGEDDON` during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that `DOCKERGEDDON` is used during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - The Resource Development phase involves identifying domains resolving to the same IP address, which is a step that could be part of the overall reconnaissance and attack preparation process but is not directly linked to the use of `DOCKERGEDDON`.

Given the information provided, the use of `DOCKERGEDDON` is explicitly mentioned as part of the Reconnaissance phase, not the Resource Development phase. Therefore, the logical sequence of TTPs does not support the idea that `DOCKERGEDDON` would be used after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: No**
