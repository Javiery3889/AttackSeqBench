### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The CTI report mentions the use of masscan to identify potential entry points.
     - Specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys were used to find publicly available resources.
     - Specific protocols and services were discovered, such as Niagara Fox and printers with web interfaces.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if AdFind would be used after the initial reconnaissance phase to gather information about organizational units (OUs) and domain trusts from Active Directory.
   - AdFind is a tool used for enumerating Active Directory objects, which is a step typically taken after gaining initial access or having reconnaissance on the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the reconnaissance phase and does not mention any specific tools or actions taken after gaining access to the network.
   - AdFind is a tool that would be used post-reconnaissance, likely after gaining some level of access to the network, to gather more detailed information about the Active Directory structure.
   - The CTI report does not provide any context that suggests the use of AdFind or any similar tool in the reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, which focuses on the reconnaissance phase and does not mention any post-reconnaissance activities, it is unlikely that AdFind would be used in the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
