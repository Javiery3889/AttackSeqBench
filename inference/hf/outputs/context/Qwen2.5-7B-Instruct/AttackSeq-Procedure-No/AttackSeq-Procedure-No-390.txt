Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the AtomBombing technique, which involves:
1. Bypassing process-level restrictions by injecting malicious code into trusted processes.
2. Accessing context-specific data (e.g., screenshots, encrypted passwords).
3. Performing Man in the Browser (MitB) attacks.
4. Evading security products by monitoring API calls for malicious activity.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after using AtomBombing to inject malicious code into a trusted process, the threat actors are likely to use a VBA script embedded within a malicious Word document as part of their strategy.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **AtomBombing Technique**: This technique focuses on injecting malicious code into trusted processes, which is a method to bypass security measures and gain access to sensitive data or perform actions within the context of a trusted process.
- **VBA Script in a Word Document**: This is a different technique where a malicious script (VBA) is embedded in a Word document to exploit users who open the document. This is a common method for delivering malware through social engineering.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- **AtomBombing** is a technique that involves direct code injection and process manipulation, which is more about evading security and gaining access to system resources.
- **VBA Script in a Word Document** is a separate technique that relies on social engineering to deliver the malicious payload. While both techniques can be used in a broader attack strategy, they serve different purposes and are not directly related in the context of the CTI outline.

Given that the CTI outline focuses on the AtomBombing technique and does not mention or imply the use of VBA scripts or Word documents, it is unlikely that the threat actors would use a VBA script as part of their strategy after using AtomBombing.

### Final Answer: B: No
