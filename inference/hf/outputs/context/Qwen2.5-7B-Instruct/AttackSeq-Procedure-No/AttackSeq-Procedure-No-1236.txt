Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: APT28 uses spear phishing emails with malicious Word and Excel documents, typosquatted domains, and iFrames leading to zero-day exploits.
2. **Execution**: The dropper (runrun.exe) installs the second stage component (winloat.exe), which deploys various tools.
3. **Persistence**: APT28 changes file timestamps to hide files.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: APT28 uses a privilege escalation tool (CVE-2014-4076).
5. **Defense Evasion**: APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe).
6. **Credential Access**: APT28 deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on mimikatz.
7. **Discovery**: APT28 scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems, with bots reporting back to a central server.
8. **Collection**: APT28 collects data using modules like pr.dll.
9. **Command and Control**: APT28 communicates with C&C servers via HTTP on port 443 or 80.
10. **Exfiltration**: APT28 exfiltrates data to the central server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if APT28 is likely to send phishing emails containing malicious links designed to collect users’ credentials before employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails for gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any phishing emails containing malicious links designed to collect users’ credentials before the initial access via spear phishing emails with malicious Word and Excel documents.
- The initial access is described as spear phishing emails with malicious Word and Excel documents, not phishing emails with malicious links.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline does not include any step where APT28 sends phishing emails containing malicious links before the initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails with malicious Word and Excel documents.
- There is no mention of any phishing emails containing malicious links before the initial access.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question does not align with the attack sequence provided in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: No**
