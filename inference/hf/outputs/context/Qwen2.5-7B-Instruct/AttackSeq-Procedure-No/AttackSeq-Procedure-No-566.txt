### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers had intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant Resource Development capabilities, including adding domains for future use and developing malware.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used various Execution techniques, including software deployment tools and system services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, including indicator removal, masquerading, subverting trust controls, and virtualization/sandbox evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions the use of valid accounts (T1078), suggesting the attackers had access to legitimate credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used process discovery and query registry techniques to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used application layer protocols and dynamic resolution for C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were focused on stealing data, which implies the use of techniques to remove data from the target network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the attackers leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions the use of valid accounts (T1078) for credential access, which suggests that the attackers had access to legitimate credentials.
   - The question is asking about the use of these credentials to log into external remote services, which is a specific subset of credential access.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the use of these credentials for external remote services, but it does indicate that the attackers had access to legitimate credentials, which could be used for such purposes.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the attackers likely leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
