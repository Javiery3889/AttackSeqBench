### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 uses various methods to gather information on victim networks, including internal reconnaissance and credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally within victim networks.
   - **Command and Control:** FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using WMI for lateral movement, FIN13 is likely to collect data from the victim's clipboard and then stage it for eventual fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention clipboard data collection as a TTP. However, it does detail other data collection methods such as credential access and network reconnaissance.
   - The focus of FIN13 is on stealing sensitive documents, credentials, and POS data for fraudulent transactions. Clipboard data, while potentially useful, is not mentioned in the provided attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no specific mention of clipboard data collection as a TTP. The primary focus is on more direct methods of data exfiltration and credential harvesting. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
