### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with an ISO file containing a zip with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various scripts are executed, including `install.vbs`, `update.vbs`, `activate.vbs`, `unactivate.vbs`, `stopedge.bat`, `resolve.dns.bat`, and `versioninfo.bat`.
   - **Persistence:** `stopedge.bat` schedules `install.vbs` to run every 33 minutes if `paycom.ini` exists.
   - **Discovery:** `versioninfo.bat` collects information about the user's computer, including directory listings, IP addresses, running processes, and system details.
   - **Collection:** `versioninfo.bat` collects information and prepares it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** `activate.vbs` and `resolvedns.bat` communicate with a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** `unactivate.vbs` exfiltrates data through a POST request, and `versioninfo.bat` exfiltrates collected information using `unactivate.vbs`.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use token impersonation or theft techniques such as duplicating a token from `ntprint.exe` to evade detection and prior to `versioninfo.bat` discovering system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any token impersonation or theft techniques. The focus is on the execution, persistence, discovery, and exfiltration of information using scripts.
   - The `versioninfo.bat` script is described as discovering system details, but there is no indication that the group uses token impersonation or theft techniques before this step.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no evidence of token impersonation or theft techniques being used by the Konni APT Group in the described attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
