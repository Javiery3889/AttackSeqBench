Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The Lazarus group deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) and backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
2. **Persistence**: The loader/spreader malware was placed in the C:\Windows\Temp directory and set to execute via a registry key.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The group used the taskkill command to disable antivirus processes and employed a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file.
4. **Lateral Movement**: The malware was spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and IP addresses.
5. **Command and Control**: The backdoor malware communicated with remote C&C servers, expecting a command line parameter for the C&C address and port number.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after deploying Hermes ransomware, the Lazarus group established command and control communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Hermes Ransomware**: The CTI outline does not mention Hermes ransomware. However, the question assumes its deployment.
- **Backdoor Malware (Samples #4 and #6)**: The CTI outline explicitly states that the backdoor malware communicated with remote C&C servers.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that the backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) was used for command and control communication.
- The question assumes the deployment of Hermes ransomware, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline but does not affect the command and control communication aspect.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI outline, the Lazarus group did establish command and control communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).

Final Answer: A: Yes
