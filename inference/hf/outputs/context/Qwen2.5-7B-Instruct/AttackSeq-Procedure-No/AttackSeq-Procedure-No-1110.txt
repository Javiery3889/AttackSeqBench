Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to infect victims.
- **Execution**: CosmicDuke uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
- **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke targets various software and Windows credentials to steal them.
- **Collection**: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
- **Exfiltration**: CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data to remote servers via FTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to enumerate Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific TTP related to Azure AD enumeration.
- The outline focuses on persistence, credential access, and data collection using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
- There is no indication of Azure AD enumeration in the provided information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence of CosmicDuke performing Azure AD enumeration.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the outline (persistence, credential access, and data collection) does not include Azure AD enumeration.
- The question asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will enumerate Azure AD users before collecting information, which is not supported by the provided information.

### Final Answer: B: No
