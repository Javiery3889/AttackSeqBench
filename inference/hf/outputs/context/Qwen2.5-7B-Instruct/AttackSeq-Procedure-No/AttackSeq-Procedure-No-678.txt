### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries use worms, scanning tools, and public search engines to detect and infect new hosts.
   - **Resource Development:** Attackers use compromised websites and open-source tools to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports and typo-squatting to trick developers into running malicious container images.
   - **Execution:** Abuse of command and script interpreters, including executing shell or Python scripts, and using cron jobs.
   - **Persistence:** Use of LD_PRELOAD and creation of new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoors.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Removal of security software and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** Use of open-source tools to collect credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Impact:** Cryptocurrency mining and emerging objectives like backdoors and malware deployments.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of attackers using Process Doppelgänging after gaining persistence by creating new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoor access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Process Doppelgänging. However, it does detail persistence methods such as creating new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - Process Doppelgänging is a technique used to hide malicious processes by making them appear as legitimate processes, which is a method of defense evasion. The CTI outline mentions defense evasion techniques, but it does not specifically link them to Process Doppelgänging.
   - The question is asking about a specific technique (Process Doppelgänging) that is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline. The outline focuses more on persistence and other evasion techniques.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of Process Doppelgänging after gaining persistence through new user accounts with RSA keys. The outline does not mention this specific technique, and the focus is more on other methods of persistence and evasion.

**Final Answer: B: No**
