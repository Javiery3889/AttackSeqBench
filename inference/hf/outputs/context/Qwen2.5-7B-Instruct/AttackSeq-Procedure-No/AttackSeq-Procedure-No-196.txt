### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, often exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0199. The malware downloaded includes various RATs like RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC.
   - **Execution:** The malware are .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator, which unpack to reveal commercial RATs. The ProCC campaigns use Delphi binaries with a customized backdoor capable of clipboard and printer spooler data collection, as well as screenshot capturing.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies, and sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will likely utilize tools to capture mouse movements after capturing credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the ProCC campaigns use a customized backdoor capable of clipboard and printer spooler data collection, as well as screenshot capturing. However, there is no explicit mention of mouse movement capture.
   - The question specifically asks about a tool to capture mouse movements, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign includes a tool to capture mouse movements. The outline focuses on clipboard and printer spooler data collection and screenshot capturing, but does not mention mouse movement capture.

**Final Answer: B: No**
