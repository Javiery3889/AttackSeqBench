### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Deployment of various custom and commodity malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of PowerShell commands and various tools like DarkComet and POSHC2.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools.
   - **Exfiltration:** Use of custom .NET and AutoIt FTP tools for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Elfin is likely to use credential stuffing against victim's remote services before deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention credential stuffing as a tactic used by Elfin.
   - The outline does mention credential dumping as part of their tactics, but it does not indicate that credential stuffing is a preceding step.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the outline suggests that Elfin uses various tools and techniques for persistence and defense evasion, but there is no indication of credential stuffing being used as a preliminary step.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that Elfin uses credential stuffing as a preliminary step before deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
