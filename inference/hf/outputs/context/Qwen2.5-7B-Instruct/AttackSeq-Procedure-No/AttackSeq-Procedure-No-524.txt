### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The document uses VBA macros to decrypt the embedded data and drop files like 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).
   - **Command and Control:** The Bandook loader, written in Delphi, uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process. The payload then contacts the C&C server and sends basic information about the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a COM object to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads the zip file. The outline describes the use of VBA macros to decrypt and drop files, and the use of Process Hollowing for command and control.
   - The question is asking about a specific sequence of TTPs that are not directly mentioned in the CTI outline. The outline does not provide any information about the use of COM objects for gathering system information.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of a COM object to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads the zip file. The outline focuses on the initial access via a malicious Word document, the use of VBA macros, and the command and control mechanism using Process Hollowing. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
