Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware and performs internal reconnaissance.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 ensures malware remains active through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions, including domain administrator privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses DLL search order hijacking and sideloading to execute modified versions of open-source tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 pushes and pulls data to and from various networks.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if APT10, after gaining higher-level permissions such as domain administrator, is likely to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module for OS credential dumping by using DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention APT10 using AWS Secrets Manager or the `enum_secrets` module.
   - The outline does mention APT10 using DLL search order hijacking and sideloading to execute modified versions of open-source tools, which aligns with the question's use of DLL load order hijacking.
   - However, the question introduces a specific tool (`enum_secrets`) and a specific target (AWS Secrets Manager), which are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, APT10's known tactics and techniques do not include targeting AWS Secrets Manager or using the `enum_secrets` module. The outline focuses on more traditional Windows-based tools and techniques.

**Final Answer: No**
