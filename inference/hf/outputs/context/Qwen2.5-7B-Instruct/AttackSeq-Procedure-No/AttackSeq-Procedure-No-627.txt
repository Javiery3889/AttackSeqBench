Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods, including PowerShell and custom loaders.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** The SombRAT backdoor had capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. Network scanning tools like pscan and nmap were also used.
   - **Collection:** Data was archived using a custom storage file format.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery after establishing a Command and Control channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the SombRAT backdoor had capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery as part of the Discovery phase.
   - The question does not specify a particular sequence of TTPs but asks about the likelihood of these activities occurring after the C2 channel is established.

Given the information in the CTI outline, the SombRAT backdoor is known to perform process discovery and system information discovery as part of its operations, which aligns with the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
