Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** They use JSPRAT for local command execution and file operations.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use Mimikatz to extract credentials from LSASS and other utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.
   - **Credential Access:** They obtain credentials through LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI for remote command execution and movement across the network.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if, after using WMI for lateral movement, FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance, specifically after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that FIN13 uses Mimikatz to extract credentials from LSASS and other utilities for privilege escalation. This indicates that they do indeed gather credentials through LSASS memory dumping.
   - The question specifically asks about gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering user account information, but it does indicate that they use Mimikatz for credential access, which is a common tool for gathering such information.
   - The CTI outline also mentions that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement, which aligns with the question's scenario.

Given the information provided, while the CTI outline does not explicitly state the use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering user account information, the context and the tools mentioned (like Mimikatz) strongly suggest that such actions are part of their typical behavior.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
