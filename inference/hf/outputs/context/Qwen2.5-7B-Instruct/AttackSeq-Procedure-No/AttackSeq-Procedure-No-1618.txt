Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Regin can be installed through various means, including visiting spoofed websites or exploiting applications.
- **Execution**: Regin has a multi-staged architecture with six stages, each performing specific functions.
- **Persistence**: Regin is designed to maintain a long-term presence on infected systems.
- **Defense Evasion**: Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself and its activities.
- **Credential Access**: Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic.
- **Discovery**: Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization, scans for deleted files, and monitors network traffic.
- **Command and Control**: Regin can initiate communications with compromised computers and serve as a proxy for other infections.
- **Exfiltration**: Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase, Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery Phase**: The CTI outline mentions that Regin can gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files. This aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Monitoring Network Traffic**: The CTI outline also states that Regin can monitor network traffic, which is consistent with the second part of the question.
- **Setting Auto-Forward Rules**: The CTI outline does not mention Regin setting auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts. This is a specific action that is not described in the provided CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on Regin's capabilities in gathering information, monitoring network traffic, and other activities but does not mention setting auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts.
- The question asks if Regin is likely to perform an action (setting auto-forward rules) that is not described in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no evidence to suggest that Regin would perform this specific action.

### Final Answer: B: No
