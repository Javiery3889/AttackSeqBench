Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
2. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
5. **Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
6. **Collection**: APT15 used various tools to collect data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after deploying backdoors and leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings, APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Backdoor Deployment**: The CTI outline mentions that APT15 deployed BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
- **Bypassing Policy Settings**: The CTI outline states that RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The CTI outline explicitly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
- **Credential Access**: The CTI outline also mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Backdoor Deployment**: APT15 deployed multiple backdoors, including RoyalCLI.
2. **Bypassing Policy Settings**: RoyalCLI was used to bypass policy settings, which aligns with the question's context.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The CTI outline clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Credential Access**: The CTI outline also confirms that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

Given the detailed information in the CTI outline, it is clear that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access after deploying the backdoors and leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass policy settings.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
