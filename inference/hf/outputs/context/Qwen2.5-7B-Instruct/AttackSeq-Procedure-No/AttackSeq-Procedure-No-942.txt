Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key phases and TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Utilized watering hole tactics with exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
2. **Execution**: Chained vulnerabilities to execute custom shellcode and download a payload named 'dropper.dll'.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Used PowerShell loader to download and execute additional malware samples.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Implemented checks for security software to avoid detection.
5. **Discovery**: SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information and capture screenshots.
6. **Command and Control**: SLUB malware communicated with a Mattermost server for real-time updates and exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after SLUB malware collects system information and captures screenshots during the Discovery phase, it is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the SLUB variant interacts with a Mattermost server to collect information and capture screenshots, which are then sent back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
- This interaction is explicitly mentioned as part of the Discovery phase, but the exfiltration of the collected data and log files is not directly stated as part of the Exfiltration phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exfiltration of collected data and log files as part of the Exfiltration phase. The interaction with the Mattermost server is described as part of the Discovery phase.
- The question asks if the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase. Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support this claim.

### Final Answer: B: No
