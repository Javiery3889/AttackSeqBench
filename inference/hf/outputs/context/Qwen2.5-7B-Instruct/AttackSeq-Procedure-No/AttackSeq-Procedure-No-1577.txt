Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks to infect targets.
- **Execution**: They used command and scripting interpreters to deploy malicious code.
- **Persistence**: They used various persistence techniques.
- **Privilege Escalation**: They employed techniques to gain higher-level permissions.
- **Defense Evasion**: They used various evasion techniques.
- **Credential Access**: They targeted user credentials.
- **Discovery**: They used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing before using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline mentions that Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks to infect targets. This aligns with the question's mention of "internal spear phishing."
- **Lateral Movement**: The question asks about lateral movement, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the discovery phase involves using scanning tools to find machines in the network, which is a form of lateral movement.
- **Tools Mentioned**: The CTI outline does not mention the use of remote services or the specific scanning tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) before the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The CTI outline confirms that Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks, which aligns with the question.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The CTI outline does not explicitly mention lateral movement, but the use of scanning tools in the discovery phase can be considered a form of lateral movement.
3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence that includes the use of remote services and specific scanning tools before the discovery phase.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not explicitly support the use of remote services and specific scanning tools before the discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
