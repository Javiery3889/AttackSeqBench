### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to deliver malicious JavaScript, which led to the execution of Cobalt Strike and other discovery scripts.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a malicious JavaScript file delivered via a zipped file to initiate the attack.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed to download and execute a .NET injector, which then executed the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers used slui.exe and wmic.exe to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** PsExec was used to disable Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and emptying log files.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used various commands to profile the system and search for computer objects in Active Directory.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for moving laterally across the network.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Defense Evasion:** PsExec was used to launch a command line tool for managing Windows Defender, disabling scanning, removing definitions, and stopping services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the WastedLocker ransomware, after deploying using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender, is likely to delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deletion of system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands. However, it does describe the use of PsExec to disable Windows Defender and stop services, which is part of the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The Impact phase typically involves the ransomware's destructive actions, such as encrypting files and deleting shadow copies to prevent data recovery.
   - Given the context of the attack and the nature of ransomware, it is highly plausible that the WastedLocker ransomware would delete system volume shadow copies to hinder data recovery efforts.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
