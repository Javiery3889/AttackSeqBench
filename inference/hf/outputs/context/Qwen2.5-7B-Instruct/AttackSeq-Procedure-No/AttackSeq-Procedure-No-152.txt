### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance by loading them directly into memory and deleting the files after execution.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework that operates in-memory, and removed all disk-resident tools to maintain stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded commercial EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention any lateral movement or the use of SAML tokens.
   - The focus of the CTI outline is on initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and command and control, with no indication of lateral movement or the use of SAML tokens.
   - The question assumes a phase of lateral movement, which is not directly supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence or context to support the use of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
