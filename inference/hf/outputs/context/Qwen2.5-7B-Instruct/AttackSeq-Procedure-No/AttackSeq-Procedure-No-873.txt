Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The attackers then used two distinct vulnerabilities in the Windows OS kernel (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to escalate privileges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after:
- Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
- Exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- Achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The CTI outline states that the attackers used CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to escalate privileges.

The question does not explicitly mention a Dropper module or a Stager module. However, the sequence of events described in the CTI outline aligns with the question's requirement for initial access and privilege escalation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly describes the initial access through zero-day exploits and privilege escalation through specific vulnerabilities.
- The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation after these steps, which are consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Given that the CTI outline does not provide information about a Dropper or Stager module, and the sequence of initial access and privilege escalation is consistent with the question, the most plausible answer is that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation after these steps.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
