Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The malware creates an unnamed event object, uses GetMessage to process messages, and creates a new process to run systeminfo and tasklist commands.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses GetTempPathW, InternetOpenW, and HttpOpenRequestW to establish a connection to the C2 server.
3. **Discovery**: The malware enumerates files and directories from the Desktop directory, targets specific directories, and retrieves the NetBIOS name and user name.
4. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with the C2 server using an HTTP POST request, sends exfiltrated data, and downloads a DLL file.
5. **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates collected information using an HTTP POST request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if SkinnyBoy is likely to send the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request only before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery**: The malware conducts discovery by enumerating files and directories and extracting the volume serial number.
- **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with the C2 server using an HTTP POST request and sends exfiltrated data.
- **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates collected information using an HTTP POST request.

The CTI outline clearly states that SkinnyBoy exfiltrates collected information to the C2 server using an HTTP POST request. There is no mention of using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding the data before exfiltration. The outline does not indicate any step where the malware automates the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention any step where SkinnyBoy uses the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding data before exfiltration.
- The malware is known to exfiltrate data directly via HTTP POST requests.
- The question asks if the malware sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request only before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding. Given the information provided, this is not a plausible sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
