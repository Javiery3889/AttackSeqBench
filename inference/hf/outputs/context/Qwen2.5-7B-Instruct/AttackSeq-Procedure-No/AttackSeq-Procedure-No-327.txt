Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on an iOS device, either hidden or not, depending on the iOS version.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs in the background and can collect various types of information.
   - **Discovery:** The malware is designed to collect text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after the malware has completed certain actions (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files), it is likely to collect text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the malware is designed to collect text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other information during the Discovery phase.
   - The actions mentioned in the question (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files) are part of the Command and Control (C2) phase, not the Discovery phase.
   - The malware's design and capabilities described in the CTI outline indicate that it is capable of collecting the specified information during the Discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the malware collects text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.
   - The actions in the question (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files) are part of the C2 phase and do not contradict the malware's ability to collect the specified information during the Discovery phase.
   - Therefore, it is highly plausible that the malware will continue to collect the specified information during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
