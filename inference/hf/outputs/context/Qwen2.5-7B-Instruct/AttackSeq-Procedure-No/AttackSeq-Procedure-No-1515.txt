Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer to the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's system.
6. **Collection**: Collecting a wide range of data from the victim's system.
7. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C&C server using encrypted communication.
8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the backdoor, after shutting down the victim's computer, is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer. However, it does describe the backdoor's capabilities for data collection and exfiltration.
- The backdoor is described as having the capability to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide information about the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer. This detail is not mentioned in the attack sequence.
- The backdoor is explicitly described as having the capability to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication. This is a core function of the backdoor as described in the CTI outline.

Given that the backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication, and there is no information suggesting it would be shut down in a way that would prevent this function, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor would continue to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
