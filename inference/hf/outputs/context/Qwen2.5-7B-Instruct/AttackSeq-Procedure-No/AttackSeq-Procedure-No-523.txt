Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The initial access involves a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
- **Defense Evasion**: The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time. The malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components, and the final Bandook payload is signed with valid certificates from Certum.
- **Command and Control**: The Bandook loader, written in Delphi, uses the Process Hollowing technique to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process. The payload then contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and awaits further commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload only before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload. Instead, it states that 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' are dropped into the system, with 'sdmc.jpg' being base64 encoded PowerShell code.
- The outline does not provide any information about 'fmx.ps1' downloading additional files or components.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes the initial access and the steps taken by the malware after the initial infection. It mentions that 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' are dropped, with 'sdmc.jpg' containing base64 encoded PowerShell code.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file containing additional components before executing the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.
- The question asks if it is likely that 'fmx.ps1' will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
