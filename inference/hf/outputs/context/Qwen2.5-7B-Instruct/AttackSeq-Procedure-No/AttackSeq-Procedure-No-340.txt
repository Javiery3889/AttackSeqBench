### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Persistence:** The malware, Nemesis, infects the Volume Boot Record (VBR) to achieve persistence. This ensures the malware remains active even after a system reinstallation.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware includes backdoors with various network protocols and communication channels for CnC. It provides capabilities such as file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling.
   - **Evolution:** The malware is continually updated, with different variants and added functionalities. The use of bootkits for persistence is noted as a sophisticated technique that makes detection and removal challenging.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning after infecting the VBR.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the malware placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. However, the context of the malware being a sophisticated bootkit (Nemesis) and the emphasis on its persistence and evasion techniques suggest that the malware is designed to be stealthy and difficult to detect.
   - The use of a bootkit to infect the VBR implies that the malware is already deeply integrated into the system at a low level, making it less likely to rely on traditional file scanning methods to evade detection.

### Final Answer:
Given the sophisticated nature of the Nemesis bootkit and its focus on persistence and evasion, it is less likely that the malware would place install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. The malware is more likely to leverage its low-level system access to remain undetected.

**Final Answer: B: No**
