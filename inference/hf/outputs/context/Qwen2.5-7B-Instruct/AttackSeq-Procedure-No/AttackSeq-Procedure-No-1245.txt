Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Execution**: SUNSPOT malware inserts the SUNBURST backdoor into the SolarWinds Orion product builds.
- **Persistence**: SUNSPOT maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.
- **Privilege Escalation**: SUNSPOT grants itself debugging privileges.
- **Defense Evasion**: SUNSPOT uses encryption and masquerading techniques.
- **Discovery**: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe after modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor. This is directly related to the Discovery tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline explicitly states that SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.
- The question is asking if this monitoring occurs after the backdoor is injected.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that SUNSPOT uses the Discovery tactic to monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.
- The question is asking if this monitoring occurs after the backdoor is injected, which is a logical sequence of events in the attack lifecycle.
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that would suggest this monitoring does not occur after the backdoor is injected.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SUNSPOT will indeed monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe after the backdoor is injected.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
