Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and answer the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It would use the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverage the DCOM object to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script would communicate with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads would be GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific exploit or vulnerability (such as CVE-2018-13379) being used in the campaign.
- The campaign uses phishing emails to deliver malicious Word documents with embedded macros, which then execute a PowerShell script to download and run payloads.
- The execution and defense evasion techniques described do not indicate any specific exploit of a known vulnerability like CVE-2018-13379.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the use of phishing emails, macros, and PowerShell scripts to deliver and execute malware.
- There is no mention of exploiting a specific vulnerability like CVE-2018-13379.
- The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: No
Final Answer: B: No
