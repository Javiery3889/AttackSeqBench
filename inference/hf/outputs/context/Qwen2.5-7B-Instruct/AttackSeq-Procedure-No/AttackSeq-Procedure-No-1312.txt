Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Opening a malicious document via phishing email.
2. **Execution**: Executing various VBS scripts and HTA files, creating scheduled tasks, and executing commands via scripts.
3. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through scheduled tasks that execute malicious VBS files.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Using mshta.exe and scheduled tasks to evade detection.
5. **Collection**: Deploying multiple variants of custom VBS backdoors and executing VBS scripts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers. The specific TTPs mentioned are:
- Utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers.
- Deploying software such as GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel.
- Using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we can infer the following:
- The attack starts with initial access and execution of malicious files.
- Persistence is established through scheduled tasks.
- Defense evasion techniques are used to maintain the foothold.
- Collection involves deploying custom VBS backdoors and scripts.

The question does not directly align with the TTPs described in the CTI outline. The CTI outline does not mention HTTP requests, GOGETTER tunneler, or "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channels. Instead, it focuses on the initial compromise, execution, persistence, and collection of data using VBS scripts and backdoors.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the CTI outline, the TTPs described do not include the use of HTTP requests, GOGETTER tunneler, or "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channels. The CTI outline does not provide any indication that Shuckworm would use these specific tools or techniques.

**Final Answer: B: No**
