### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign uses malicious documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros and activating payloads.
   - **Persistence:** The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros for payload activation, the campaign will create a pipe to enable inter-process communication before achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the creation of a pipe for inter-process communication. It only states that the persistence mechanism involves adding the path to a VBS script to the task scheduler.
   - The outline does not provide any information about inter-process communication or pipes being used in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the campaign creates a pipe for inter-process communication. The persistence mechanism is clearly described as adding the path to a VBS script to the task scheduler.

**Final Answer: B: No**
