### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** Targets publicly facing web servers, uses both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery.
   - **Execution:** Explosive Trojan contains a main executable and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:** Explosive can be installed in various system directories and uses keylogging for credential access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Hides from detection tools, changes versions and builds, and uses a separate DLL for suspicious API activities.
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Explosive Trojan will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement after gaining administrator passwords.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of an AD FS server or SAML tokens for lateral movement.
   - The outline focuses on the use of keylogging for credential access and a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.
   - There is no information suggesting the use of an AD FS server or SAML tokens for lateral movement.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the Explosive Trojan would use an AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement. The focus is on keylogging for credential access and a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.

**Final Answer: B: No**
