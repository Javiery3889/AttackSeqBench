Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links.
- **Defense Evasion**: The attackers use an undocumented Word feature (INCLUDEPICTURE field with Unicode links) to bypass security measures and send a GET request to the attacker's server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails and then use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access vector is through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links.
- The defense evasion technique involves the use of an undocumented Word feature to send a GET request to the attacker's server when the document is opened.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the CTI outline matches the sequence in the question. The attackers first use spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links, and then they use the undocumented Word feature to send a GET request to the attacker's server.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would use these techniques, and based on the CTI outline, this is indeed the sequence of TTPs used by the attackers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
