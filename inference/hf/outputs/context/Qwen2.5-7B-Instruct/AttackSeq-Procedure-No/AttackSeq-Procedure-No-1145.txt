### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - The report mentions the discovery of various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces.
   - It also notes the presence of medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that support the MQTT protocol and are discoverable online.
   - The context provided in "Others" includes statistics on malware prevalence and mentions that APT actors target pharmaceutical organizations using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol, cybercriminals would likely use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline indicates that the medical devices and systems are discoverable online, which aligns with the use of tools like Shodan and Censys to find such publicly available resources.
   - Shodan and Censys are well-known search engines for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other networked devices, which can be used to discover and exploit such devices.
   - The context of the report suggests that these devices are potential targets for cybercriminals due to their discoverability and potential vulnerabilities.

### Final Answer:
Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after uncovering outdated systems or devices supporting the MQTT protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
