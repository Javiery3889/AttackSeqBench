### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used various methods, including weaponized RTF files, archive files, and direct delivery via an executable.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:** The Aria-body backdoor gathered detailed system information, including hostname, computer-name, username, domain name, Windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, and public IP.
   - **Command and Control:** The group used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication, sending collected data to the C&C domain.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gathering detailed system information, the Aria-body backdoor is likely to set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning for capturing victim credentials or planting espionage-oriented malware as part of the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning as a TTP used by the Naikon APT group.
   - The outline focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and discovery of system information. It does not provide any details about the Collection phase or specific TTPs like Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning.
   - The Aria-body backdoor is described as gathering system information and communicating with C&C servers, but there is no indication of it being used for Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning or planting espionage-oriented malware.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the Aria-body backdoor would set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning for capturing victim credentials or planting espionage-oriented malware as part of the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
