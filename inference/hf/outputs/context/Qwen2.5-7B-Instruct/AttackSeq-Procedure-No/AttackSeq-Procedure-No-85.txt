Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Vyveva backdoor. Here are the relevant parts for our analysis:

- **Discovery**: Vyveva's backdoor can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), list running processes (T1057), obtain system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version and architecture (T1082), obtain the local IP address (T1016), and system time and time zone (T1124).
- **Command and Control**: Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001), communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002), and exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041).

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva's backdoor will collect files from the computer only after obtaining system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Vyveva can obtain system information (T1082) and the local IP address (T1016) as part of the discovery phase.
- The question suggests a sequence where files are collected only after obtaining system information. This aligns with the discovery phase where Vyveva gathers necessary information about the system before potentially exfiltrating data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that Vyveva performs discovery activities, including obtaining system information, before potentially exfiltrating data.
- The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva will collect files only after obtaining system information, which is a logical sequence given the discovery phase.
- The answer choices are:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to conclude that Vyveva would gather system information before collecting and exfiltrating files.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
