### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** The malware sideloaded a malicious DLL, `hccutils.dll`, using a legitimate Microsoft executable, `igfxtray.exe`.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry modifications and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used various evasion techniques, including customizing installation to avoid detection by 24 security products.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captured data about the infected system, including files on removable media and Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after T9000 steals sensitive data, it is likely to exfiltrate the collected data using the MIME protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of the MIME protocol for exfiltration. Instead, it states that the malware communicates with the C2 server using a binary protocol.
   - The question asks about a specific protocol (MIME) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the malware uses a binary protocol for communication with the C2 server, not MIME. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
