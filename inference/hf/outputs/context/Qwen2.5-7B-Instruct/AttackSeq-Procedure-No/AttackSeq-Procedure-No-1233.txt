Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: APT28 scans for new targets using a Python script, a database, scan bots, and a Django application.
2. **Initial Access**: APT28 uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits to infect targets.
3. **Execution**: The dropper (runrun.exe) and the second stage component (winloat.exe) are installed, deploying various tools.
4. **Persistence**: Persistence is ensured by changing file timestamps.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: APT28 uses a privilege escalation tool (CVE-2014-4076).
6. **Defense Evasion**: APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to evade defenses.
7. **Credential Access**: APT28 deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe).
8. **Discovery**: APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots.
9. **Command and Control**: APT28 communicates with the C&C server via HTTP on port 443 or 80.
10. **Exfiltration**: APT28 exfiltrates data to the central server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only after deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the discovery phase (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) occurs during the reconnaissance phase, which is before the deployment of additional modules like pr.dll.
- The deployment of pr.dll is part of the exfiltration phase, which is after the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The discovery phase (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) is explicitly mentioned as part of the reconnaissance phase in the CTI outline.
- The deployment of pr.dll is part of the exfiltration phase, which comes after the discovery phase.
- Therefore, APT28 would not perform discovery only after deploying additional modules like pr.dll.

### Final Answer: No (B)
