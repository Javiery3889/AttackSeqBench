Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software, using a constructor function within the dylib to initiate.
3. **Persistence**: The malware persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including daemonizing and detaching from the 3CX process, deleting itself from disk, and writing configuration files to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
5. **Discovery**: The malware collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json.
6. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
7. **Exfiltration**: The malware automatically exfiltrates collected data via a HTTP GET request over HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file during discovery, Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information stored in SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any interaction with SharePoint instances. The malware's activities are focused on:
  - Collecting OS version and other system information.
  - Persisting and evading detection.
  - Communicating with C2 servers.
  - Exfiltrating data.

- There is no indication in the CTI outline that Smooth Operator interacts with SharePoint or any other external data sources before communicating with its C2 servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that Smooth Operator accesses or downloads information from SharePoint instances.
- The malware's primary activities are related to initial access, persistence, discovery, and communication with C2 servers.
- There is no mention of SharePoint or any external data sources in the provided CTI outline.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that Smooth Operator does not access and download information from SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B: No**
