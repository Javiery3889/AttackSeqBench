### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware drops a batch file and a cabinet file in `C:\ProgramData` with a random name. The cabinet file contains partially encrypted malicious shellcode and a DLL.
   - **Execution:** The malicious executable executes the batch file, decompressing and executing the DLL. The shellcode decrypts the rest of the encrypted data, revealing a C&C IP address and port.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is achieved by creating a new service or registry key, depending on the malware's privileges. The registry key for persistence is `rundll32.exe_malicious_DLL_path` in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the Iron Tiger malware is likely to download additional payloads using a command-and-control (C&C) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware downloads additional payloads after achieving persistence. However, the presence of a C&C IP address and port in the shellcode suggests that the malware can communicate with a C&C server.
   - The malware also has the capability to load and execute attacker plugins in memory, which implies the ability to download and execute additional payloads.
   - The presence of tools like 'Mozilla' and 'Noodles' that can connect to a C&C server and support SSL and TCP further supports the likelihood of downloading additional payloads.

### Final Answer:
Based on the context provided in the CTI outline, the malware has the capability to communicate with a C&C server and execute additional payloads. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the malware is likely to download additional payloads after achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
