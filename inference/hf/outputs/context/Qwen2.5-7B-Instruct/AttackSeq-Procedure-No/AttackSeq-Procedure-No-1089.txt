### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The document exploits CVE-2017-11882 to silently execute code without user interaction.
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, `educrety.exe`, searches for stored passwords and access tokens using T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry).
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials are sent to a command and control server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is encrypted and exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any file deletion or defense evasion tactics before the silent code execution.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the outline is:
     1. Initial Access (Spearphishing Attachment)
     2. Execution (Exploiting CVE-2017-11882)
     3. Credential Access (Credential Dumping, Credentials in Files, Credentials in Registry)
     4. Collection (Data from Local System)
     5. Command and Control (Data Sent to C2 Server)
     6. Exfiltration (Data Encrypted and Exfiltrated)
   - T1107 (File Deletion) is not part of the outlined sequence and does not fit the context of the attack described.

### Final Answer:
Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the campaign would employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

**Final Answer: B: No**
