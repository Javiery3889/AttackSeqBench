### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary obtained SSH access and used `wget` to download malware.
   - **Execution:** The custom loader runs Derusbi, which drops and loads a Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) into the kernel.
   - **Persistence:** The Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Turbo LKM modifies the system's global call table and disables write protection to modify the system call table, evading detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware binds to a raw socket and communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Derusbi will retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Derusbi performing any actions such as retrieving metadata or listing the current working directory. The focus is on the initial access, execution, persistence, and command and control mechanisms.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline does not include any steps that would suggest Derusbi retrieves metadata or lists the current working directory before initiating C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no indication that Derusbi retrieves metadata for files on disk or lists the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include these actions.

**Final Answer: B: No**
