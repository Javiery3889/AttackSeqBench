### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries use worms and scanning tools like masscan to detect and infect new hosts. They also use public search engines and scripts to configure netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Initial Access:** Attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports and use typo-squatting to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
   - **Execution:** They abuse command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries, including downloading and executing scripts from remote sources.
   - **Persistence:** Adversaries use LD_PRELOAD and hostPath mounts to gain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use hostPath mounts and chroot to gain persistence on the host.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They remove security software and use obfuscation techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxy tools and legitimate external websites for C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate AWS credentials and use C2 servers for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if attackers will delete shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` after deploying worms and exploiting Docker API ports to gain initial access, before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific actions related to deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
   - The focus of the attack sequence is on reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, command and control, and exfiltration. There is no indication of any step involving the deletion of shadow volumes.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that attackers will delete shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` as part of their attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
