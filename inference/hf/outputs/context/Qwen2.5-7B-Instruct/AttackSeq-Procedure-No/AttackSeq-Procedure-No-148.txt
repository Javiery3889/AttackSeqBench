### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** Executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** Utilized web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used custom versions of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded commercial EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** Modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials and dropped NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 established command and control (C2) by using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point after accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific C2 communication methods, such as GitLab or Digital Point.
   - The outline does mention that TG1021 actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them, which suggests a focus on stealth and minimal footprint.
   - The use of web shells and in-memory malware (NodeIISWeb) indicates a preference for maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.
   - The question asks about a one-way communication method, which is less common in typical C2 setups, where bidirectional communication is more common for control and data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Given the context and the focus on stealth and minimal footprint, it is unlikely that TG1021 would use a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point for C2. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
