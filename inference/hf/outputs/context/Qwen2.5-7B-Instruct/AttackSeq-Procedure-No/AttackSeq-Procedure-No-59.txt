Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates.
2. **Persistence**: Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, and changing file system paths.
4. **Credential Access**: Steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
5. **Discovery**: Collects information about the victim's computer, including the computer name, username, operating system version and bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed.
6. **Command and Control**: Communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, only before employing numerous tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection of Information**: The CTI outline clearly states that Grandoreiro collects information about the victim's computer, including the operating system version and installed security products, as part of its **Discovery** phase.
- **Evading Detection**: The CTI outline mentions that Grandoreiro employs various evasion techniques, including API hooking and detection of virtual environments, as part of its **Privilege Escalation** phase.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The CTI outline does not indicate that Grandoreiro collects information only before employing evasion techniques. Instead, it suggests that information collection and evasion techniques are part of different phases of the attack.
- The question implies a sequence where information is collected first, and then evasion techniques are used. However, the CTI outline does not support this sequence.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not support the idea that Grandoreiro collects information only before employing evasion techniques. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
