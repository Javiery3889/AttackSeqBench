Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
- **Resource Development**: Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain similar to Falcon Coin.
- **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
- **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network.
- **Defense Evasion**: The implant is designed to evade detection and persist on the network.
- **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after gaining initial access through spear phishing emails containing the embedded Adobe Flash exploit, the Bankshot implant will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a COM object to execute queries for gathering system information.
- The outline does mention that the implant is designed to persist and evade detection, but it does not specify the exact method of gathering system information.
- The question is asking about a specific TTP (using a COM object to gather system information), which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the overall attack sequence, including initial access, persistence, and command and control.
- It does not provide specific details about the method used to gather system information after the initial access.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (COM object) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the use of a COM object to gather system information. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Bankshot implant does not use a COM object for this purpose.

### Final Answer: B: No
