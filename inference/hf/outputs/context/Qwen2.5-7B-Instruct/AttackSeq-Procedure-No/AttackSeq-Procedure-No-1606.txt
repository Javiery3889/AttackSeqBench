### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final payloads.
   - **Execution:** SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - **Persistence:** They use various techniques to maintain persistence, including malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They employ tactics to avoid detection, such as using decoy documents and images, and mimicking legitimate processes.
   - **Collection:** They utilize modular plugins to carry out specific malicious tasks, such as file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including keyloggers. Keyloggers are known to capture keystrokes, which can include mouse movements and API hooking as a method to capture user interactions.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention mouse movement capture or API hooking as separate TTPs, but it does indicate that SideCopy uses keyloggers for credential harvesting, which can include capturing mouse movements and API hooking as part of the broader keylogging process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that keyloggers are a common method for capturing keystrokes and can include mouse movements and API hooking, it is plausible that SideCopy would use such techniques before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
