Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script executed by the macro operated in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing a Word document with embedded VBS macros.
- **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The outline mentions that the PowerShell script executed by the macro operated in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
- **Command and Control**: The outline specifies that the PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
- **Impact**: The outline confirms that the downloaded payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The campaign began with phishing emails containing a Word document with embedded VBS macros.
2. The VBS macro executed a PowerShell script in memory.
3. The PowerShell script communicated with C2 servers to download GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
4. The outline does not mention any encoded PowerShell script, but it does describe the PowerShell script executing in memory and downloading the specified malware.

Given the sequence of events described in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the question's scenario.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
