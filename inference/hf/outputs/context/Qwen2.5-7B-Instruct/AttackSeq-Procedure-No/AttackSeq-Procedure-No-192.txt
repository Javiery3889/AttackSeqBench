Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: DRAGONFISH distributes a new variant of Elise malware through a malicious Microsoft Word document.
2. **Execution**: The malware starts the Internet Explorer process in a suspended state, injects the NavShExt.dll into the process, and calls the DLL's export function named 'Setting'.
3. **Persistence**: The malware uses the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD to achieve persistence and injects hidden DLLs into the Internet Explorer process.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs various defense evasion techniques, including anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation.
5. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive files and commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if DRAGONFISH is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections and query Active Directory for computers to gather directory information after achieving persistence and injecting hidden DLLs into the Internet Explorer process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to remotely discovering systems over LAN connections or querying Active Directory.
- The outlined TTPs focus on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control. There is no indication of lateral movement or reconnaissance activities such as querying Active Directory.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that suggests DRAGONFISH is performing lateral movement or querying Active Directory.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (querying Active Directory) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that DRAGONFISH is not likely to perform the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
