### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** A malware was sent via a suspicious email with a .lnk file attachment.
   - **Execution:** The .lnk file's target property contained MS-DOS obfuscated code that executed a PowerShell script, which then ran another PowerShell script in memory, creating a decoy DOC file, a legitimate tool for installing .NET files, and a .NET DLL containing the actual malicious payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used InstallUtil.exe to avoid detection by Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - **Command and Control:** The payload was identified as a Cobalt Strike beacon.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware will establish persistence by using Microsoft Outlook add-ins after the .lnk file delivers its payload and the PowerShell script obfuscates its execution in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any persistence mechanisms, such as using Microsoft Outlook add-ins, scheduled tasks, or any other form of persistence.
   - The focus of the attack is on initial access, execution, and command and control, with specific techniques like obfuscation and evasion.
   - There is no indication in the CTI outline that the malware uses Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the malware does not use Microsoft Outlook add-ins for persistence. The outline focuses on initial access, execution, and command and control, without mentioning any persistence mechanisms.

**Final Answer: B: No**
