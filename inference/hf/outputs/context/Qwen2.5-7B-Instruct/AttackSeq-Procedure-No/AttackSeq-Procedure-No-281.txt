Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file containing a disguised Word document.
2. **Execution**: The backdoor opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path.
3. **Persistence**: The backdoor creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a specific location based on the user's UID.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor avoids detection by using a robust string encoding mechanism and a custom binary protocol with encryption.
5. **Discovery**: The backdoor gathers and sends victim details such as name, machine serial number, and system information to the command and control server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after initiating command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode. The specific TTPs mentioned are:
- Command and Control Communication
- Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we know that the backdoor initiates command and control communication as part of its operation. The question then asks if the backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server after this communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Command and Control Communication**: The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption for communication with its command and control server.
2. **Discovery**: The CTI outline explicitly states that the backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server, including details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information.

Given this information, the backdoor is indeed likely to perform the "Discovery" TTP after initiating command and control communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
