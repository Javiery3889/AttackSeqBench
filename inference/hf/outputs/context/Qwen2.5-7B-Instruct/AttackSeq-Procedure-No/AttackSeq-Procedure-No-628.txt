Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer to the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The CostaRicto Campaign used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods, including PowerShell and custom VM-based loaders.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
4. **Discovery**: The SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. Network scanning tools like pscan and nmap were also used.
5. **Collection**: Collected data and stored it in a custom format.
6. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure after performing process and system information discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of blogs or WordPress for C2 infrastructure.
- The outline focuses on the use of SSH, scheduled tasks, and custom loaders for execution, and network scanning tools for discovery.
- The exfiltration phase is mentioned, but it does not specify the method of C2 communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of blogs or WordPress for C2 infrastructure.
- The question asks about a specific method (blogs and WordPress) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no indication that the CostaRicto Campaign used blogs or WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

### Final Answer: B: No
