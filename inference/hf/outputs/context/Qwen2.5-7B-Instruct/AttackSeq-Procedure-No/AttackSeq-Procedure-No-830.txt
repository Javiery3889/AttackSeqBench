### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** GreyEnergy targets energy companies and high-value organizations in Ukraine and Poland for espionage and reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is modular and uses a 'mini' backdoor before deploying the full version.
   - **Initial Access:** GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers as infection vectors.
   - **Persistence:** Malware components are securely wiped from victims' hard drives.
   - **Credential Access:** Common tools like Mimikatz and PsExec are used for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Internal C&C proxies are deployed to redirect requests to an external C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if GreyEnergy is likely to deploy a container to execute a command to create a reverse shell on the node before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of containers or the creation of a reverse shell as part of the attack sequence.
   - The outline focuses on initial access, persistence, credential access, and command and control techniques, but does not detail the use of containers or reverse shells.
   - The stealth techniques mentioned (partial AES-256 encryption) are described as a later stage of the attack, after initial access and persistence.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, there is no indication that GreyEnergy uses containers or creates reverse shells as part of their attack sequence. The focus is on initial access, persistence, and command and control techniques, with stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption being a later stage.

**Final Answer: B: No**
