Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attackers collected information on their targets, tailoring their approach based on various details.
2. **Initial Access**: The campaign used phishing attacks through fake security alerts and Google Drive download pages.
3. **Persistence**: In some cases, the hackers did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and used third-party services to host these images. They also used a hidden tracking image to alert attackers when a target opened the email.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether, after using images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, the attackers are likely to gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that in some cases, the hackers did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time. This suggests that the attackers were able to maintain access without prompting for additional credentials.
- The use of images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems is a method to bypass initial detection, but it does not directly indicate the use of a keylogger plugin.
- Keyloggers are typically used to capture keystrokes and gather sensitive information like passwords, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline as a primary method used by the attackers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of keyloggers as a method to gather account credentials.
- The attackers' persistence tactic of not changing passwords and monitoring communications in real-time suggests they were able to maintain access without needing to gather credentials via a keylogger.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin after using images in phishing emails. Given the information provided, this is not a likely scenario based on the outlined TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
