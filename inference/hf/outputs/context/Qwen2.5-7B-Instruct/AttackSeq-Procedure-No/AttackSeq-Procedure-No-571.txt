### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that the attackers used a supply chain compromise, specifically a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain).
   - **Discovery:** The report lists Discovery techniques such as T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry, indicating that the threat actors used these techniques to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network of the compromised organizations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using a compromised software update as an initial access vector, the threat actors conducted Discovery efforts (Process Discovery and Query Registry) before demonstrating sophisticated Defense Evasion techniques (Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly mentions Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry) as part of the attack sequence.
   - The question aligns with the sequence of TTPs as described in the CTI outline, where Discovery techniques are mentioned after the Initial Access technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline, it is logical to conclude that the threat actors would conduct Discovery efforts after gaining initial access through a supply chain compromise.
   - The question does not contradict the provided information and aligns with the attack sequence described.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
