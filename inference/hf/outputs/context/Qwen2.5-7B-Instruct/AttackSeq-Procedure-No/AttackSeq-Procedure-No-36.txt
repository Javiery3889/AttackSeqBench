### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing with legitimate-looking documents.
   - **Execution:** Downloader that installs the backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler and hidden files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, packing, and masquerading.
   - **Discovery:** Enumerates nearby Wi-Fi networks, detects newly inserted devices, produces file listings, and enumerates running processes to gather browser data.
   - **Collection:** Steals clipboard contents, copies files, logs keystrokes, captures screenshots, and stages data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses FTP and HTTP for communication, with fallback channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates collected data, encrypts it, and sends it over the same channel used for C&C.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after the discovery activities, the malware is likely to deploy a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a network sniffer module. However, the malware does gather browser data and keystrokes, which could include credentials.
   - The malware's activities are focused on collecting data from the local system and exfiltrating it. There is no indication of the malware sniffing network traffic to discover credentials being sent over the network.
   - The question asks about a specific TTP (network sniffing) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that Machete deploys a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network. The malware's activities are more focused on local data collection and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
