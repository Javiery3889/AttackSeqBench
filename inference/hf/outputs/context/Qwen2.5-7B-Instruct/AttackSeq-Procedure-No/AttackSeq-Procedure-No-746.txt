Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Execution**: Malicious document with macro code that executes to drop the first payload (Crimson RAT downloader).
2. **Persistence**: The first payload downloads and drops the fully functional Crimson RAT to a specific path.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The payload has the capability to kill any process running in the system.
4. **Credential Access**: The Crimson RAT has functionalities for keylogging and browser credential theft.
5. **Command and Control**: The payload receives commands from the C&C server and supports various commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of social media channels for delivering malicious files.
- The attack sequence described involves a spear phishing campaign (malicious document with macro code) and then downloading the Crimson RAT from a specified IP address.
- The question suggests a different method (social media) for delivering the malicious file, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attack starts with a malicious document (spear phishing) and then proceeds to download the Crimson RAT from a specific IP address.
- There is no mention of social media channels in the CTI outline.
- The question asks if it is likely that social media channels will be used, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of social media channels for delivering the malicious file.

**Final Answer: No**
