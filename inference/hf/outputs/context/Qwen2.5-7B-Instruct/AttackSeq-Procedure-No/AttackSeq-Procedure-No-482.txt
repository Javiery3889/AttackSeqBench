Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report outlines the following TTPs and their sequence:
1. **Resource Development**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the same vulnerabilities to gain access to the systems.
3. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: Creating registry Run key entries and installing SparrowDoor as a service.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Injecting encrypted shellcode into processes and adjusting token privileges.
6. **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
7. **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.
8. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted multi-byte XOR keys.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the likelihood of FamousSparrow exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor for Command and Control and encrypted communications.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (C2)**: The CTI report states that SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted multi-byte XOR keys.
- **Data Exfiltration**: The CTI report does not explicitly mention a specific schedule for data exfiltration. However, it does state that SparrowDoor has the capability to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report does not provide any specific information about the frequency of data exfiltration or the use of a scheduled transfer method.
- The question assumes a specific behavior (exfiltration every 10 minutes) that is not supported by the provided CTI outline.
- Given the lack of explicit information about the exfiltration schedule, we cannot confidently say that FamousSparrow will exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.

### Final Answer: B: No
