### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to silently execute code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Techniques used include file deletion, hidden files and directories, and software packing.
   - **Credential Access:** The PE file searched for stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor is likely to proceed to collect data from the local system before employing defense evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the dropped PE file (educrety.exe) searched for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys, which is a form of credential access (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - The defense evasion techniques (T1107, T1158, T1045) are mentioned after the credential access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline indicates that the threat actor first exploits CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, then proceeds to collect data from the local system (credential access), and finally employs defense evasion techniques.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns with this sequence is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
