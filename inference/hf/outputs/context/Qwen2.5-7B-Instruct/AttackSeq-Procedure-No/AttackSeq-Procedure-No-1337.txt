Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) by embedding it within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).
2. **Execution**: The malware payload (Rdws.exe) deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique, using the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll), which then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
3. **Defense Evasion**: The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable. The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after connecting back to the exploit domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) during command and control communication, the malware is likely to use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware used a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) and establish evasion.
- The question specifically mentions connecting back to the exploit domain and asks if sideloading techniques are likely to be used for deployment and evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of sideloading techniques for deploying a malicious DLL and establishing evasion.
- The question aligns with this information by asking about the likelihood of sideloading techniques being used after connecting back to the exploit domain.

Given the clear alignment between the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
