Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer to the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack involving several TTPs:
1. **Execution**: 
   - LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack.
   - Uses 'certutil.exe' renamed to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection.
   - Decodes and decompresses content.
   - Executes a JavaScript file.
   - Creates and executes 'd3reEW.exe'.
   - Copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as 'officeupdate.exe'.
   - Adds 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks for persistence.
2. **Persistence**: 
   - Creates 'd3reEW.exe' in a public downloads directory.
   - Executes 'svchast.exe'.
   - Copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as 'officeupdate.exe'.
   - Adds 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
3. **Defense Evasion**: 
   - Uses renamed 'certutil.exe' to bypass security detection.
4. **Discovery**: 
   - Uses 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information.
5. **Command and Control**: 
   - Resolves imports, allocates memory, and creates a thread to make HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor after distributing malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention compromising legitimate web browser updates.
- The attack sequence described involves the use of a LNK file, JavaScript, and a decoy PDF document to execute a series of actions, including persistence and command and control.
- The Higaisa APT group is known for using various methods to maintain persistence and establish command and control, but the specific TTP of compromising legitimate web browser updates is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the execution, persistence, and command and control aspects of the attack.
- There is no direct evidence in the CTI outline that the Higaisa APT group has used or will use the method of compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (compromising legitimate web browser updates) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: No
The CTI outline does not provide evidence that the Higaisa APT group will use the method of compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No."
