Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: The Tuyul botnet uses a Perl script to execute commands on victim systems.
2. **Persistence**: The malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses various PHP web shells to gain access to servers.
4. **Command and Control**: The Tuyul botnet uses the domain `irc[.]localroot[.]xyz` as its C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems, the Tuyul malware is likely to leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access. This is a common TTP in many cyber attacks.
- **Leverage Legitimate Credentials**: The question asks if the malware will leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. This is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- **Periodic Download of 'cron' Script**: The CTI outline states that the malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. It focuses on the malware's execution, persistence, and C&C communication.
- The malware's persistence mechanism involves downloading a bash script named 'cron', which is consistent with the question's scenario.

### Final Answer
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. The malware's persistence mechanism is described as downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

Final Answer: B: No
