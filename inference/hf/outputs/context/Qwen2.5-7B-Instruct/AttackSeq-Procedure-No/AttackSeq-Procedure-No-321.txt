Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on already compromised systems, similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is fully functional malware that runs in the background on iOS 7, with different behavior on iOS 8.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device, after it has already uploaded files via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP for data exfiltration. However, it does describe the app's capabilities in collecting and potentially transmitting various types of data.
   - The question is asking about a specific sequence of TTPs: uploading files via FTP and then sending data via HTTP.
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information that would suggest the app uses HTTP for data exfiltration after FTP. The malware's behavior is described in terms of its capabilities and the types of data it collects, but not in terms of the protocols used for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that the malware uses HTTP for data exfiltration after FTP.
   - The question asks if the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device, after it has already uploaded files via FTP.
   - Given the lack of information in the CTI outline about HTTP usage, and the fact that the malware's behavior is described in terms of its capabilities rather than the protocols used for exfiltration, it is more plausible that the malware does not use HTTP for this specific sequence of operations.

**Final Answer: B: No**
