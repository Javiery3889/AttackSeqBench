Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The threat actor group used spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that downloaded a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in the document.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware used a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload without triggering a UAC pop-up. This involved copying the INI configuration file and the main payload EXE into the System32 folder.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The UAC bypass module was used to prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing, allowing the malware to execute without alerting the user.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after using a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges, it is likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process only after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access involved downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document.
- The privilege escalation involved using a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload.
- There is no mention of batch files being used in a multi-step process after the initial download and execution of the CAB file.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not indicate any use of batch files in a multi-step process after the initial download and execution of the CAB file.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline is:
  1. Spear phishing emails with malicious documents.
  2. Downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site.
  3. Executing the CAB file to download the malware.
  4. Using a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.

Given this sequence, the use of batch files in a multi-step process is not mentioned or implied.

### Final Answer: B: No
