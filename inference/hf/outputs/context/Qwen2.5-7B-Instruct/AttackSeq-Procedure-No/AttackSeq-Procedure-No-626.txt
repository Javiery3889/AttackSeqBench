Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
4. **Discovery**: Capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
5. **Collection**: Archiving of collected data.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and capabilities to bypass HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic.
- The outline does not mention any exfiltration of data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SombRAT backdoor's communication with C2 servers is explicitly described as using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic.
- There is no information in the CTI outline suggesting that the SombRAT backdoor would exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
- The question asks if it is likely, and given the detailed description of the C2 communication methods, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor would use a different protocol for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: No
