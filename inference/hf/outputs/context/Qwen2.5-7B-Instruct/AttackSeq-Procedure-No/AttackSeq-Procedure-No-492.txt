Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Malicious URL discovered.
2. **Execution**: Deployment of Backdoor.Graphon and other tools.
3. **Persistence**: Registry value set for persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Blending with legitimate network traffic and using decoy URLs.
5. **Collection**: Custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.
6. **Exfiltration**: Screenshots saved to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the likelihood of the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon using the FTP protocol for C2 communication after the collection phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for C2 communication.
- The outline does mention that the Harvester group attempted to blend its malicious activities with legitimate network traffic, but it does not specify the protocol used for C2 communication.
- The question asks about a specific protocol (FTP) and a specific tool (Cobalt Strike Beacon), which are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of FTP or Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- The question introduces new elements (FTP and Cobalt Strike Beacon) that are not present in the CTI outline.
- Given the lack of information in the CTI outline about the specific C2 communication methods used, we cannot confirm or deny the use of FTP or Cobalt Strike Beacon.

However, based on the options provided:
- **A: Yes** - There is no evidence in the CTI outline to support this.
- **B: No** - Similarly, there is no evidence to support this either.

Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the specific C2 communication methods used, and the question introduces new elements not present in the outline, the most plausible answer is that we cannot confirm the use of FTP or Cobalt Strike Beacon based on the given information.

### Final Answer: B: No
