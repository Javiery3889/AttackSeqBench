Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Patchwork targeted US-based think tanks, using themes from well-known think tank organizations.
2. **Initial Access**: The threat actors used spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
3. **Persistence**: After the initial dropper (qrat.exe) is executed, it creates a directory and drops the final QuasarRAT binary, and also sets up a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
4. **Command and Control**: The malware initiates a request to determine the geographical location and then establishes a connection to the C2 domain.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if recipients are likely to receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is through spear phishing emails containing RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.
- The persistence and command and control steps follow the initial infection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the threat actors used spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
2. **Persistence**: After the initial infection, the malware sets up persistence mechanisms.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware then establishes a connection to the C2 domain.

Given this sequence, the recipients are likely to receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 as part of the initial access phase, not after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

### Final Answer: No
