Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The NewsBeef APT group used spearphishing and watering hole attacks with malicious macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents.
- **Defense Evasion**: They improved their JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques.
- **Command and Control**: They used the Pupy backdoor and the obfs3 protocol for communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of the campaign's execution phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions the use of malicious macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents and PowerSploit (which is a PowerShell-based framework) for initial access.
- The outline does not mention the use of DDE or the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic.
- The outline does not provide any information about the execution phase beyond the initial access and command and control phases.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of DDE or the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic.
- The outline focuses on the use of malicious macros and PowerShell (PowerSploit) for initial access and command and control.
- There is no evidence in the CTI outline to support the use of DDE or the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic.

### Final Answer: No
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not include the use of DDE or the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic. Therefore, the answer is "No".
