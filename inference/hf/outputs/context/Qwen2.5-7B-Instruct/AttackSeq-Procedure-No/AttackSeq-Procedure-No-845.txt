Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The OceanLotus group uses a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown' delivered via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros or RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading.
- **Defense Evasion**: KerrDown uses a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs. The DLL is dropped in a specific directory and retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using DES, and executes it in memory.
- **Command and Control**: The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after delivering KerrDown to targets via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading. Specifically, it asks if the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via Office Documents with macros or RAR archives.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs, but this is not mentioned in the context of the Office document itself. The base64 decoding is part of the malware's execution process after the initial delivery.
- **Command and Control**: The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is not directly related to the question about the Office document.

### Step 4: Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the Office document itself, which is part of the initial access phase. The CTI outline does not mention the Office document using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture. Instead, it mentions that the malware uses a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs after the initial delivery.
- The question also mentions an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, which is not supported by the CTI outline. The CTI outline does not mention any image file or instructions to enable macros.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the Office document does not use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture and does not contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

### Final Answer: B: No
