Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Collection**: SunBird and Hornbill collect various types of data and store it in SQLite databases, compress it into ZIP files, and store it in hidden folders.
- **Command and Control**: 
  - SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals.
  - Hornbill uploads data to C2 servers only when data changes.
  - SunBird's C2 infrastructure was insecurely configured, exposing over 18GB of exfiltrated data.
  - The C2 domains pieupdate[.]online and samaatv[.]online are associated with Confucius APT infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether SunBird and Hornbill will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels to their command and control servers only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **SunBird**: The CTI outline states that SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals. This implies that the data is exfiltrated to the C2 servers as soon as it is collected and stored.
- **Hornbill**: The CTI outline states that Hornbill uploads data to C2 servers only when data changes. This also implies that the data is exfiltrated to the C2 servers as soon as it is collected and stored, but only when there is a change.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **SunBird**: SunBird's behavior is consistent with exfiltrating data to the C2 servers at regular intervals, which means the data is exfiltrated immediately after it is collected and stored.
- **Hornbill**: Hornbill's behavior is consistent with exfiltrating data to the C2 servers only when there is a change, which also means the data is exfiltrated immediately after it is collected and stored, but only when there is a change.

In both cases, the data is exfiltrated to the C2 servers as soon as it is collected and stored, not after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

### Final Answer: B: No
