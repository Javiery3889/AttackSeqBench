### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The INOCNATION campaign used a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client.
   - **Execution:** The RAT installer executed a malicious DLL payload that was obfuscated and rebuilt during installation. The malware used anti-behavioral analysis techniques, such as comparing mouse cursor positions to detect sandbox environments.
   - **Persistence:** The malware set up a persistence mechanism by creating a registry key.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware used encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections for command and control communications, employing Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries. Additionally, it used a single-byte XOR encoding within the decrypted SSL/TLS communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the campaign is likely to use Debugger Evasion tactics, such as the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function or checking system flags and CPU registers, before establishing command and control through encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections with additional XOR encoding.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware used anti-behavioral analysis techniques, such as comparing mouse cursor positions to detect sandbox environments. This indicates that the malware already has some form of behavioral analysis evasion.
   - Debugger Evasion techniques, such as the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function, are a type of anti-debugging technique. However, the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of such techniques.
   - The malware does use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and additional XOR encoding for command and control communications, which aligns with the question's description of establishing command and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Debugger Evasion techniques like CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, the malware does employ other forms of anti-behavioral analysis techniques. The question asks if it is "likely" that the campaign will use these techniques, and given the sophistication of the malware and the context of the campaign, it is plausible that such techniques could be used.
   - However, the CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of the use of these specific techniques, and the question is asking for a likelihood based on the information provided.

Given the context and the plausible nature of such techniques in a sophisticated campaign, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Debugger Evasion techniques, and the question is asking for a likelihood based on the provided information, which does not strongly support the use of such specific techniques.
