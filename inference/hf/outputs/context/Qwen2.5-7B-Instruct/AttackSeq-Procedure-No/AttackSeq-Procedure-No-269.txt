Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
- **Execution**: Custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant.
- **Persistence**: Establishes persistence by creating a directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
- **Defense Evasion**: Uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
- **Discovery**: Collects system information.
- **Collection**: Collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data via a custom protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Korplug variant will communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, only before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the communication protocol used for C&C server communication. However, it does mention that data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol.
- The question specifies a custom TCP-based protocol with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline.
- The CTI outline states that data collection occurs after the initial access and execution phases, which aligns with the question's sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the C&C communication protocol, but it does mention that data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol.
- The question asks if the Korplug variant will communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, only before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
- Given the information in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence is that the malware would first establish a connection (possibly with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP) and then proceed to collect data.

### Final Answer: No
The correct answer is B: No, because the CTI outline does not provide evidence that the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP occurs before data collection. The data collection is mentioned as a later step in the attack sequence.
