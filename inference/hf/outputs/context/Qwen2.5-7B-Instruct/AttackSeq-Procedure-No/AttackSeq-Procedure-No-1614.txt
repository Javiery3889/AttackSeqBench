Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key attack sequence:
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack targets Mexican banking institutions and is linked to a Brazilian campaign.
2. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, leading to the execution of a malicious .bat file.
3. **Execution**: The .bat file triggers a PowerShell script that downloads and executes the main malware.
4. **Persistence**: The script creates persistence mechanisms.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
6. **Credential Access**: The malware aims to steal bank credentials and collect email accounts from the contacts list.
7. **Collection**: The malware accesses Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
8. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers after the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we know that the malware collects email accounts from the contacts list and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request. There is no mention of FTP or any other exfiltration method being used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the collected email accounts are sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
- There is no information about FTP or any other exfiltration method being used.
- The question asks if the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
