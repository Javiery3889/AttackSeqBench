Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** An email with a PDF attachment that was actually an executable file.
   - **Execution:** The executable file created a folder, extracted files, and ran several scripts and batch files.
   - **Persistence:** Modified the Windows registry to ensure a batch file ran at system start, used legitimate applications to collect credentials, and configured an application to run another batch file every hour.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts.
   - **Collection:** Recurrent collection of credentials every hour.
   - **Command and Control:** Used FTP commands to upload stolen credentials.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated stolen credentials to an FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after uploading credentials to an external FTP server, the attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores only after persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used legitimate applications to collect credentials and configured applications to run batch files every hour for persistence.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline supports the idea that the attackers would continue to use legitimate applications to collect credentials and maintain persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information in the CTI outline, the attackers did indeed use legitimate applications to collect credentials and configured applications to run batch files every hour for persistence.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence and the context provided is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
