Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The threat actor developed a domain (falcancoin.io) that mimics a legitimate cryptocurrency-lending platform.
2. **Initial Access**: The attack began with spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document.
3. **Execution**: The document exploits CVE-2018-4878 to download and execute the Bankshot implant.
4. **Persistence**: The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on the victim's network.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The implant includes functionality to wipe files and content to erase evidence.
6. **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers, which are disguised as Chinese-language online gambling sites.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase after using the Bankshot malware implant.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any use of Telegram or any social engineering tactics like impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials.
- The attack sequence described focuses on initial access via spear phishing, execution of the Bankshot implant, persistence, and command and control.
- There is no information provided about any additional social engineering tactics or reconnaissance beyond the initial access and execution phases.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence of Hidden Cobra using Telegram or any other social engineering tactics to harvest credentials.
- The attack sequence described is focused on technical means of gaining access and maintaining persistence, without any mention of additional social engineering activities.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that Hidden Cobra would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
