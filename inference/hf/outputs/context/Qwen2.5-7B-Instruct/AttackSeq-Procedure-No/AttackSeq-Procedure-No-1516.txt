Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer to the question.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
2. **Execution**: Use of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creation of a scheduled task to maintain a foothold.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
5. **Discovery**: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. **Collection**: Collecting a wide range of data from the victim's system.
7. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C&C server using a specific protocol.
8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the backdoor is likely to deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions after exfiltrating data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to deploying CaddyWiper or any form of data wiping.
- The focus of the attack is on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, data collection, and exfiltration.
- There is no indication of any destructive or wiping activities in the provided CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes a surveillance operation where the attackers gather and exfiltrate data but does not mention any destructive actions.
- CaddyWiper is a known malware that targets industrial control systems (ICS) and is used for destructive purposes, which is not aligned with the described surveillance operation.
- The question asks if the backdoor is likely to deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data, and based on the provided information, there is no evidence to support this.

### Final Answer: B: No
