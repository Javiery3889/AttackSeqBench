### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Deployed 64-bit and 32-bit backdoors using various methods, including PowerShell and custom loaders.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed techniques like process injection and deobfuscation.
   - **Collection:** Archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with C2 servers using DNS and HTTP, with SSL encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware will identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host before archiving collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the malware identifying the installed anti-virus product before archiving data.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the outline does not include any steps related to identifying the anti-virus product.
   - The malware's actions are focused on gaining access, executing payloads, evading defenses, collecting data, and exfiltrating it. There is no indication of the malware checking for the presence of an anti-virus product.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware does not include a step to identify the installed anti-virus product before archiving collected data. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include this step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
