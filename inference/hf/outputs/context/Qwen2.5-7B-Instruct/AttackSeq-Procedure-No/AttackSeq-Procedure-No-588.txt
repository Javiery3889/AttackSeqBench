Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Gholee malware campaign used a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file.
2. **Execution**: The malicious Excel file, when executed, creates and runs a PE file (NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll) using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware establishes a command and control connection using an SSL connection over port 443 with an expired digital certificate.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether the Gholee malware will clear mailbox data to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any step where the malware clears mailbox data.
- The malware's actions described in the outline are:
  1. Initial access via a spear phishing attack.
  2. Execution of the malicious PE file.
  3. Establishing a command and control connection using an expired digital certificate.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware clearing mailbox data.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the outline does not include any step where the malware clears mailbox data.
- The question asks about a specific action (clearing mailbox data) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not perform this action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
