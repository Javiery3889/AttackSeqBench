### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of the same vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - **Execution:** Use of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of registry Run key entries and installation as a service.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Not detailed in the report.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injection of encrypted shellcode into processes, token privilege adjustments, and file obfuscation.
   - **Discovery:** Collection of system information and probing of files.
   - **Collection:** Reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any phishing activities or stealing application access tokens. The attack sequence described focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining initial access, executing the backdoor, and then moving through the Discovery phase by collecting system information and probing files.
   - The question introduces a new tactic (phishing for application access tokens) that is not present in the provided CTI outline. The outline does not indicate any phishing activities or the use of social engineering to steal access tokens.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no evidence of phishing activities or stealing application access tokens. Therefore, it is unlikely that FamousSparrow would use such tactics as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
