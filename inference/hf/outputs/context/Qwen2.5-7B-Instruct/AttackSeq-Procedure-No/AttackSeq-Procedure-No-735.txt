### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing, phishing mass-mailing, and drive-by downloads.
   - **Execution:** Downloading programs for remote, hidden administration to gain system administrators' credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Setting up malware within infrastructure software and reinstalling malware on internal sites.
   - **Discovery:** Using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after causing multi-million dollar losses and transferring or withdrawing money, the cybercriminals will explore the financial systems of the targeted organizations using remote administration tools in the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that in the **Discovery** phase, cybercriminals use remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.
   - The question mentions the impact phase, which is not explicitly detailed in the CTI outline. However, the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) is logical and follows a typical cyber attack lifecycle.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of remote administration tools in the discovery phase to explore financial systems, it is highly plausible that the cybercriminals would continue this activity even after causing significant financial losses.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence and the context provided is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
