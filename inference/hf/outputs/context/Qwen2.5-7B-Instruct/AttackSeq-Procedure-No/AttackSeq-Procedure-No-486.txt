Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI report details the following sequence of TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
3. **Persistence**: Creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Injecting encrypted shellcode into processes and adjusting token privileges.
5. **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
6. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
7. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz, FamousSparrow is likely to retrieve metadata for files on disk and list the current working directory during the Discovery phase before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access**: The CTI report explicitly states that FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
- **Discovery**: The CTI report does not mention any specific Discovery phase TTPs, such as retrieving metadata for files on disk or listing the current working directory.
- **Collection**: The CTI report states that FamousSparrow's Collection tactics included the ability to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report does not provide any specific information about the Discovery phase, which includes actions like retrieving metadata for files on disk or listing the current working directory.
- The sequence of TTPs in the CTI report does not indicate that FamousSparrow performs these actions before reading file contents and exfiltrating them.
- The question assumes a specific sequence of actions (Discovery -> Collection) that is not explicitly supported by the CTI report.

### Final Answer: B: No
