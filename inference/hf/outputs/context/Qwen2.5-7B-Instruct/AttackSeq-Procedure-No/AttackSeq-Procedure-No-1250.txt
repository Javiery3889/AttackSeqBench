### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** BlueBravo uses spearphishing emails with malicious links to deliver malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware, such as GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton, acts as loaders with basic C2 functionality and implements anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Persistence:** BlueBravo establishes persistence by copying malicious ISO files and creating registry run keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use various techniques including obfuscation, API unhooking, and sandbox evasion.
   - **Command and Control:** BlueBravo uses HTTPS for C2 communication, which is encrypted and Base64-encoded. They also use web services like OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlueBravo's malware will gather the timestamp from the victim's machine before attempting encrypted HTTPS communication with its C2 server after employing defense evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the malware gathering a timestamp from the victim's machine as part of its TTPs.
   - The defense evasion techniques mentioned (DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling) are aimed at evading detection and analysis, not at gathering timestamps.
   - The malware's actions described (loading, persistence, and C2 communication) do not include gathering timestamps as a step in the process.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that BlueBravo's malware gathers a timestamp from the victim's machine before attempting encrypted HTTPS communication with its C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
