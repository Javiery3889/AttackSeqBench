Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by FIN13. Here are the relevant parts for our analysis:

- **Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Exfiltration**: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting and archiving sensitive data, FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data over web services.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any DNS Calculation techniques or any specific method for determining command and control ports.
- The exfiltration method described in the CTI outline involves using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories, which is a straightforward method for data exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that FIN13 uses DNS Calculation techniques for determining command and control ports.
- The exfiltration method described is consistent with the use of web shells and JSP tools, which are common and straightforward methods for data exfiltration.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that FIN13 employs DNS Calculation techniques as part of their TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
