Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign used malicious documents to gather information.
2. **Initial Access**: Malicious documents were distributed via Dropbox and contained a macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader.
3. **Execution**: The macro downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
4. **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
5. **Command and Control**: The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
6. **Exfiltration**: Data was exfiltrated using RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of the MAC address as part of the attack sequence.
- The outline focuses on the steps of the attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, command and control, and exfiltration.
- The implant's capabilities are mentioned, but there is no specific mention of MAC address collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any direct evidence that the Rising Sun implant collects the MAC address as part of its activities.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (collection of MAC address) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no indication that the Rising Sun implant performs this specific action.

### Final Answer: B: No
