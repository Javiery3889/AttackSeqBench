### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Persistence:** The CTI report details various persistence mechanisms used by different macOS malware.
     - Alchimist: Uses a Bash script to install a persistent Chrome browser extension.
     - ChromeLoader: Uses a Bash script to install a persistent Chrome browser extension.
     - CloudMensis: Employs a downloader and implant for persistent operations.
     - CrateDepression: Checks for the GITLAB_CI environment variable and retrieves a second-stage payload for persistence.
     - DazzleSpy: Installs a LaunchAgent for persistence that masquerades as an Apple launch service.
     - Gimmick: Uses similar persistence agent labels as macOS.Macma.
     - Operation In(ter)ception: Installs a LaunchAgent for persistence in the user's local folder.
     - oRAT: Delivers a payload to the /tmp directory for persistence.
     - The VPN Trojan: Executes a script which drops a persistence agent with the filename com.apple.softwareupdate.plist.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The CTI report details various defense evasion techniques.
     - Alchimist: Contains a privilege escalation exploit for CVE-2021-4034.
     - ChromeLoader: Attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.
     - CloudMensis: Exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions.
     - DazzleSpy: Uses advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain a foothold on infected machines.
     - Gimmick and Macma: Share indicator overlaps, suggesting evasion tactics.
     - Operation In(ter)ception: Uses lures and masquerades as legitimate processes for evasion.
     - The VPN Trojan: Has superficial similarities to DazzleSpy, indicating possible evasion techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** The CTI report mentions various C2 techniques.
     - Alchimist: Uses a web interface for controlling the implanted malware and generating payloads.
     - ChromeLoader: Installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic and communicate with the attacker's C2.
     - CloudMensis: Uses public cloud storage services for C2 communication.
     - Gimmick: Takes advantage of cloud hosting services like Google Drive for its C2 communications.
     - Operation In(ter)ception: Serves as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.
     - oRAT: Includes a custom package with primary backdoor functionality for C2 communication.
     - The VPN Trojan: Reaches out to a C2 for further tasking.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether other macOS malware such as Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis would employ their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access only after CrateDepression has dropped its payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CrateDepression:** Drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal' after checking for the GITLAB_CI environment variable.
   - **Alchimist:** Uses a Bash script to install a persistent Chrome browser extension.
   - **ChromeLoader:** Uses a Bash script to install a persistent Chrome browser extension.
   - **CloudMensis:** Employs a downloader and implant for persistent operations.
   - **Initial Access:** The question is about initial access, which is typically the first step in the attack lifecycle. The CTI report does not indicate that any of the mentioned malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before performing their initial access.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, there is no indication that Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis would wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before performing their initial access. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that these malware would perform their initial access independently of CrateDepression.

**Final Answer: B: No**
