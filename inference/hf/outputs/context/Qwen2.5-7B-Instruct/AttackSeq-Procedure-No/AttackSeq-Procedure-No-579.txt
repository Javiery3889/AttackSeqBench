### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **CTI Outline Analysis:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the FIN8 group using BADHATCH to gain initial access via a malicious PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a domain mapped by sslip.io.
   - **Execution:** BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode, executing commands like `info`, `Ping-Comp`, `Check-Port`, `Check-Share`, `psx`, and `GetComputerInfo`.
   - **Persistence:** The script sets up an event consumer named `PerfData` using WMI, which involves creating a `Win32_Base64Class` with a base64 string of a .NET binary for code injection.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The deployment of BADHATCH involves privilege escalation, likely using the SYSTEM token.
   - **Defense Evasion:** BADHATCH uses TLS encryption and masquerades its communication as legitimate HTTP requests.
   - **Credential Access:** The execution of `mimi.ps1` suggests credential dumping.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement to the Domain Controller is achieved using `wmic.exe` to create a process on the DC and execute the BADHATCH deployment script.

2. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery using tools such as `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` before performing system owner/user discovery by issuing commands like `whoami.exe`.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of `nltest.exe` or `ping.exe` for domain trust discovery.
   - The outline does mention the use of `GetComputerInfo` and `info` commands, which are more likely to be used for system owner/user discovery.
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the specific tools used for domain trust discovery.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of the use of `nltest.exe` or `ping.exe` for domain trust discovery. The outline focuses more on the execution of commands for system information and privilege escalation rather than domain trust discovery.

**Final Answer: No**
