Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: Adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods.
2. **Initial Access**: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign and deliver a RAT (BlackEnergy 3) through weaponized MS Office email attachments.
3. **Command and Control**: Malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled C&C server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C&C) servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance**: Adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods.
- **Initial Access**: Adversaries deliver BlackEnergy 3 through a phishing campaign.
- **Command and Control**: Malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled C&C server.

The CTI outline clearly states that the malware (BlackEnergy 3) is delivered to the network through a phishing campaign and macro execution, and then it establishes a connection to the C&C server. This sequence is consistent with the question's assertion that the malware establishes communication with the C&C server before being installed on the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline describes a sequence where adversaries first gather information and conduct reconnaissance.
- They then deliver the malware (BlackEnergy 3) through a phishing campaign, which involves employees enabling macros.
- After the malware is installed, it establishes a connection to the C&C server.

This sequence aligns with the question's assertion that the malware establishes communication with the C&C server before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
