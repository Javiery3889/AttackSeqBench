Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. **Persistence**: Achieved persistence through webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
4. **Defense Evasion**: Used webshells with obfuscation and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to evade detection.
5. **Lateral Movement**: Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts for lateral movement.
6. **Command and Control**: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, awaiting commands for various actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware in the sequence of TTPs.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is described as being used for data exfiltration, additional malware deployment, and awaiting commands from C2 servers.
- The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are not part of the outlined attack sequence and are not mentioned in the context of the attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline focuses on the methods used by Agrius to gain initial access, execute malware, maintain persistence, evade defenses, move laterally, and communicate with C2 servers.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD' malware were used in the attack sequence described.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is the primary tool used for awaiting commands from C2 servers, which includes sending recon information and downloading files.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the deployment of 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands.

**Final Answer: B: No**
