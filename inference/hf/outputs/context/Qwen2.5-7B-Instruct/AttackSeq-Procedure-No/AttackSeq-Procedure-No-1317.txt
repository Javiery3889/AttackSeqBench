Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Sayad malware. Here is the sequence of TTPs as described:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering email addresses and possibly other information through phishing emails.
2. **Resource Development**: Developing and staging the Sayad malware.
3. **Initial Access**: Gaining initial access through phishing emails.
4. **Execution**: Executing the malware by running a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable malware.
5. **Persistence**: Ensuring persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscation and non-traditional methods to evade detection.
7. **Credential Access**: Stealing sensitive information, including credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
8. **Discovery**: Collecting a wide range of information from the compromised host, including system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. It also gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C2 server to upload collected data.
10. **Exfiltration**: Uploading the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether the Sayad malware is likely to collect keystrokes, clipboard contents, and screenshots, and data from removable media only after gathering system information, open ports, and browser data during the discovery phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention keystrokes, clipboard contents, or screenshots as part of the data collected during the discovery phase.
- The discovery phase in the CTI outline focuses on system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies, as well as data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
- The question suggests that the malware might collect additional data (keystrokes, clipboard contents, and screenshots) after the initial discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware collecting keystrokes, clipboard contents, or screenshots during the discovery phase.
- The question asks if these additional data points are collected only after the initial discovery phase, which is not supported by the provided information.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the collection of keystrokes, clipboard contents, and screenshots as part of the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: B: No
