Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the Vyveva backdoor. Here are the relevant parts for the Collection and Command and Control tactics:

- **Collection**: Vyveva's backdoor can compress files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002).
- **Command and Control**: Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001), communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002), and exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041).

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic. The question is specifically about file exfiltration, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific file division or size-based splitting during the exfiltration process.
- The exfiltration process is described as compressing files with zlib and then sending them to the C&C server (T1041).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about dividing files based on size during the exfiltration process.
- The question asks about a specific TTP (dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- Given the information provided, there is no evidence to support the claim that Vyveva divides files based on size during exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: No
