Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
From the CTI outline, we can extract the following key points related to the attack sequence:
1. **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final payloads.
2. **Execution**: SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI outline clearly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, which is a form of initial access.
- **Execution**: After gaining initial access, SideCopy then uses a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final payloads.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files to gain initial access to the victim systems.
2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, SideCopy uses a series of techniques (HTAs and loader DLLs) to execute the final payloads.

Given this sequence, it is clear that SideCopy indeed executes infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
