Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: The Duke group uses Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
2. **Defense Evasion**: Seaduke is used to hide behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation, and it communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS with layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES).
3. **Collection**: Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information, updates bot configuration, uploads/download files, and has a self-delete function.
4. **Command and Control**: Seaduke communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS with multiple layers of encoding and encryption.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Duke group is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for Command and Control (C2).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Seaduke communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS with multiple layers of encoding and encryption.
- The question specifically asks if the Duke group is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention data exfiltration, but it does describe Seaduke's capabilities in communication and data retrieval.
- Given that Seaduke is designed to securely communicate with the C&C server, it is reasonable to assume that the same secure channel would be used for exfiltrating data.
- The question is asking about the likelihood of exfiltration over the same channel, and based on the information provided, it is highly plausible that the Duke group would use the same secure channel for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
