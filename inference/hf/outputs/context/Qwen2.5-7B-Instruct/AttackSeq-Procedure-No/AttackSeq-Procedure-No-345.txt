Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack with the following key points:
1. **Initial Access**: A dropper malware written in Delphi is used to download a second stage payload.
2. **Execution**: The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is downloaded and executed.
3. **Persistence**: 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The dropper is submitted to Virus Total to evade detection.
5. **Discovery**: The malware sends system information and process lists to the C2 server using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the malware, after using HTTPS for command and control operations, will likely discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware sends information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- This indicates that the malware does indeed use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' for gathering system information.
- The question asks if the malware will likely use this command after establishing HTTPS communication for command and control.
- Given the clear statement in the CTI outline, the malware is indeed expected to use this command to gather system information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
