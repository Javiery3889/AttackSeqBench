### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Tactic:** Command and Control (C&C)
   - **Key Details:**
     - The Elderwood Project attackers have established C&C servers to control compromised systems.
     - They use various C&C domains like qwby.gownsman.com, wwwcnas.org, and gate-usa.com.
     - These servers are used to retrieve commands from the attackers and maintain control over the victim's computer.
   - **Context:**
     - The Elderwood Project is a group known for using zero-day exploits and has a high level of technical capability.
     - They have been targeting various industries for the past three years, focusing on the wholesale theft of intellectual property.
     - They have a systematic approach and reuse components, indicating a well-organized and resourceful group.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Tactic:** Initial Access (Watering Hole Attacks)
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - Deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
     - Breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to deliver malware to MSP customers.
     - Maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks if the attackers will breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to deliver malware to MSP customers after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention breaching MSPs, but it does indicate that the attackers have a systematic approach and a high level of technical capability, which suggests they would likely employ such tactics to maximize their reach and control.
   - The Elderwood Project is known for its sophisticated and targeted approach, and breaching MSPs to deliver malware to their customers would be a logical and effective strategy to maintain control over a large number of systems.
