### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The CTI report mentions the use of masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
     - Specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys were used to find publicly available resources.
     - Specific protocols and services were discovered, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase after identifying Building Management systems and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Conducting reconnaissance using masscan and specialized search engines.
     - Identifying Building Management systems and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline focuses on the initial reconnaissance phase, where the primary goal is to identify potential entry points and services that could be exploited.
   - The question shifts to a more detailed phase of the attack, specifically the discovery of metadata and file listings.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the retrieval of metadata or file listings during the initial reconnaissance phase. It primarily discusses the identification of specific services and protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the retrieval of metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings is not directly mentioned as part of the initial reconnaissance phase. The focus is on identifying specific services and protocols.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings would be retrieved during the initial discovery phase based on the provided information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
