Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: Exploitation of known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Initial Access**: Gained access by exploiting the same remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
3. **Execution**: Utilized `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor. Exploited the same vulnerabilities used for initial access to execute SparrowDoor.
4. **Persistence**: Created registry Run key entries and installed SparrowDoor as a service.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Not detailed in the report.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Employed various tactics including injecting encrypted shellcode and adjusting token privileges.
7. **Credential Access**: Used a custom version of Mimikatz.
8. **Discovery**: Collected system information.
9. **Collection**: Read file contents and exfiltrated them.
10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access after running `cmd.exe` commands to execute SparrowDoor and communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Initial Access was gained by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
- The Execution phase mentions using `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing SparrowDoor, and it also states that the same vulnerabilities used for initial access were exploited to execute SparrowDoor.
- The Command and Control (C&C) communication is mentioned as being over an encrypted HTTPS channel, which is a common method for maintaining stealth and persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The CTI report explicitly states that the group gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
2. **Execution**: The Execution phase confirms that the same vulnerabilities were used to execute SparrowDoor.
3. **C&C Communication**: The C&C communication is over an encrypted HTTPS channel, which is a standard method for maintaining stealth and control.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, it is clear that the initial access was achieved through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities, and this method was also used for the execution phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
