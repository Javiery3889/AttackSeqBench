### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Outlaw group used Shellbot to compromise FTP servers and set up an IRC bouncer for command and control.
   - **Execution:** Shellbot is distributed via command injection vulnerabilities on IoT devices and Linux servers, and it can affect Windows and Android environments.
   - **Persistence:** The bot communicates persistently with C&C servers via IRC and hides from system admins and security monitoring.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Shellbot uses hardcoded process names and PING/PONG communication to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The bot gathers information about the infected host, including the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing C&C communication via an IRC channel, the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly states that the Shellbot gathers information about the infected host during the "Discovery" phase.
   - The question aligns with the "Discovery" phase, which is directly mentioned in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the Shellbot is indeed likely to gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication via an IRC channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
