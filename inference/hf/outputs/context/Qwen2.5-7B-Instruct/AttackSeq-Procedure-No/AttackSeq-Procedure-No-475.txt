Let's follow the steps to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
From the CTI outline, we can extract the following key points:
1. **Persistence**: Infamous Chisel persists by replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
3. **Collection**: The netd component collects files from the local system and application/data directories.
4. **Command and Control**: The db component provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to an SSH program.
5. **Exfiltration**: The netd component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the malware impacts the system by replacing the legitimate netd service, it is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
From the CTI outline, we can see that the netd component, which is executed after the malware replaces the legitimate netd service, is responsible for both collecting files and exfiltrating them using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The malware replaces the legitimate netd service, ensuring persistence.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
3. **Collection**: The netd component collects files from the local system and application/data directories.
4. **Exfiltration**: The netd component exfiltrates these collected files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Given this sequence, the malware indeed performs exfiltration after replacing the legitimate netd service.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
