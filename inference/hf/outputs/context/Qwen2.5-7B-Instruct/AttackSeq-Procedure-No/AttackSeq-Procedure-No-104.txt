### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Earth Empusa group used phishing attacks to deliver ActionSpy malware.
   - **Initial Access:** The phishing page invited users to download a modified Android application, which was an undocumented Android spyware named ActionSpy.
   - **Execution:** ActionSpy impersonates a legitimate Uyghur video app and collects various types of data, including device information and chat logs from messaging apps.
   - **Persistence:** ActionSpy prompts users to enable its Accessibility service to monitor and steal chat logs.
   - **Defense Evasion:** ActionSpy uses Bangcle to evade static analysis and detection.
   - **Collection:** ActionSpy supports modules for collecting data, including chat logs from WeChat, QQ, WhatsApp, and Viber.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication between the C&C server and ActionSpy is encrypted and transferred via HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that ActionSpy used an external software like NetPass to recover passwords from infected devices prior to using the Accessibility service to collect chat logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any use of external software like NetPass for password recovery.
   - The focus of ActionSpy is on collecting various types of data, including chat logs, through its own mechanisms.
   - The use of the Accessibility service is specifically mentioned as a method for monitoring and stealing chat logs, not for password recovery.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that ActionSpy used an external software like NetPass for password recovery. The malware's primary function, as described, is to collect data, including chat logs, through its own mechanisms.

**Final Answer: B: No**
