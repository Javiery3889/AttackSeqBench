Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
- **Execution**: Utilized `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
- **Persistence**: Created registry Run key entries and installed as a service.
- **Defense Evasion**: Injected encrypted shellcode into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
- **Credential Access**: Used a custom version of Mimikatz.
- **Discovery**: Collected system information.
- **Collection**: Read file contents and exfiltrated them.
- **Command and Control**: Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS.
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would use `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor before acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that after gaining Initial Access, FamousSparrow used `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
- The question mentions acquiring infrastructure for Resource Development, which is not directly related to the TTPs described in the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of `cmd.exe` for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor immediately after gaining Initial Access.
- The question introduces a step (acquiring infrastructure) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline and is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs is clear and does not include the step of acquiring infrastructure for Resource Development.

### Final Answer: B: No
