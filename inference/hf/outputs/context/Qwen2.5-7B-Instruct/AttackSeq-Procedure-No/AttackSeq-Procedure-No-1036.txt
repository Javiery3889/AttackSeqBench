### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used stolen valid user credentials to gain access through Citrix and LogMeIn.
   - **Execution:** Deployed Trochilus malware with encrypted C2 communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Utilized DLL sideloading to execute a legitimate binary and load a renamed malicious DLL.
   - **Credential Access:** Used Mimikatz to steal credentials and accessed the domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database.
   - **Collection:** Compressed and exfiltrated data using WinRAR and cURL.
   - **Command and Control:** Used Trochilus with encrypted C2 communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Employed custom malware with Dropbox for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 will leverage remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement after deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any use of remote COM execution or Beacon payloads.
   - The attack sequence described focuses on deploying Trochilus, using Mimikatz for credential theft, and exfiltrating data.
   - The question introduces a new TTP (remote COM execution and Beacon payloads) that is not present in the CTI outline.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the CTI outline does not mention any use of remote COM execution or Beacon payloads, and the attack sequence described does not include these TTPs, it is unlikely that APT10 would use these methods after the described actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that APT10 would not leverage remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
