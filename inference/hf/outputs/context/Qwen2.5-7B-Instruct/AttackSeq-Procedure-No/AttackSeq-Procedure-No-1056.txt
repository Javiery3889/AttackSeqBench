### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Packrat targets high-profile political figures and journalists in Latin American countries using malware and phishing.
   - **Resource Development:** Packrat maintains a persistent campaign with various malware and fake organizations.
   - **Initial Access:** Packrat uses malware and phishing attacks, often involving fake news organizations.
   - **Execution:** Packrat employs various types of malware, primarily COTS RATs, and uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - **Persistence:** Packrat uses malware with persistence features.
   - **Command and Control:** Packrat has a detailed command and control infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Packrat will clear logs from `/var/logs` and `/Library/logs` during execution before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention log clearing as a TTP. However, it does describe Packrat's use of obfuscation techniques and persistence.
   - The question focuses on a specific sequence of TTPs: log clearing, followed by runtime packers and obfuscation.
   - The CTI outline indicates that Packrat uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection, but it does not mention log clearing as a TTP.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This would imply that Packrat follows a specific sequence of TTPs that includes log clearing, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - **B: No** - This would imply that Packrat does not follow the specific sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, which is more consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Based on the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include log clearing as a specific step. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
