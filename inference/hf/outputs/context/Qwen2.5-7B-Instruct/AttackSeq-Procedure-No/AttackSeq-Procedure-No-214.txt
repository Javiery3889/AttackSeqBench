Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of Log4Shell to spawn new PowerShell processes.
3. **Execution**: Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional files (syn.exe and 1.dll).
4. **Persistence**: 1.dll (Milestone backdoor) ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Creates a new administrator user and executes another instance of itself.
6. **Discovery**: Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
7. **Command and Control**: Communicates with a C2 server and supports session information exfiltration.
8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher after ensuring persistence and before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any steps involving the installation of a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher.
- The sequence of TTPs in the outline is:
  1. Exploitation of Log4Shell
  2. Execution of scripts and files
  3. Persistence (copying to %APPDATA% and creating a service)
  4. Privilege escalation
  5. Discovery (system information, file and directory discovery, screen capture)
  6. Command and Control
  7. Exfiltration

The question asks about a step that is not present in the outlined sequence. The installation of a self-generated certificate to the local trust store is not mentioned in the CTI outline and does not fit into the sequence of TTPs described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not include any steps related to installing a self-generated certificate to the local trust store.
- The sequence of TTPs in the outline does not include this step.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Deep Panda is not likely to perform this action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
