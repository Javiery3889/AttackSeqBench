### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses common techniques such as ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - **Privilege Escalation:** Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
     - **Discovery:** Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries.
   - **Context:**
     - The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses common privilege escalation techniques, including dumping LSASS process memory to extract credentials.
     - The outline also mentions that FIN13 leverages native OS binaries for internal reconnaissance.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This aligns with the CTI outline, which states that FIN13 uses common privilege escalation techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and then proceeds to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - **B: No**
     - This does not align with the CTI outline, as it contradicts the sequence of TTPs described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
