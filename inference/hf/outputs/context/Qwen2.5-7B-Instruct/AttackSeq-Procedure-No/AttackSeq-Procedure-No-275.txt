Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The campaign uses a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
2. **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
3. **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
4. **Persistence**: The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
6. **Discovery**: The Korplug variant collects system information.
7. **Collection**: The Korplug variant collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
8. **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a header and a compressed and encrypted message body.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports only after collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration**: The CTI outline states that data is exfiltrated via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a header and a compressed and encrypted message body.
- **Collection**: The CTI outline mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
- **Communication with C&C Servers**: The CTI outline does not explicitly state that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports. However, it is reasonable to infer that after collecting the data, the malware would communicate with the C&C server to exfiltrate the data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
2. **Data Exfiltration**: After collecting the data, Korplug exfiltrates it via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a header and a compressed and encrypted message body.
3. **Communication with C&C Servers**: Given the nature of the malware and the custom protocol used for exfiltration, it is reasonable to assume that the communication with C&C servers would also use a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Korplug would communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports after collecting the necessary data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
