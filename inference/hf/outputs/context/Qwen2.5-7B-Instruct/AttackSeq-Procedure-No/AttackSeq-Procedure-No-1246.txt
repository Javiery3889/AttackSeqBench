Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Execution**: SUNSPOT malware inserts the SUNBURST backdoor into the SolarWinds Orion product.
2. **Persistence**: The malware maintains persistence through a scheduled task that executes at host boot.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The malware grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses encryption and masquerading techniques to evade detection.
5. **Discovery**: The malware monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the Discovery tactic (monitoring for MsBuild.exe), SUNSPOT is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any ransomware or exfiltration activities.
- The outline focuses on the initial infection, persistence, privilege escalation, and evasion techniques.
- The Discovery tactic is part of the initial reconnaissance phase to identify the target environment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about SUNSPOT engaging in ransomware activities.
- The question asks about a specific tactic (double-extortion ransomware) that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
- The CTI outline describes the malware's initial infection and persistence mechanisms, but does not indicate any subsequent ransomware or exfiltration activities.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that SUNSPOT would engage in double-extortion ransomware after the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer: B: No
