### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing emails with infected documents.
   - **Execution:** Multi-stage infection framework 'Matryoshka' with a dropper, loader, and RAT component.
   - **Persistence:** RAT component ensures persistence by copying the reflective loader to common Windows folders and creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot. It also schedules a task to rerun the injection routine every 20 minutes.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals Outlook passwords.
   - **Collection:** Capabilities for screen grabbing and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses DNS protocol for C2 communication with substitute ciphers.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over DNS protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the CopyKittens group is likely to disable Windows event logging after ensuring persistence by creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention disabling Windows event logging. However, the group is known for their stealthy and effective multi-stage attacks, and they avoid using known tools and packers by developing their own.
   - Disabling Windows event logging is a common technique to reduce the risk of detection, especially when multiple instances of a RAT might run simultaneously. This aligns with the CopyKittens group's known tactics of avoiding detection and maintaining stealth.

### Final Answer:
Given the CopyKittens group's known tactics for maintaining stealth and avoiding detection, it is highly likely that they would disable Windows event logging to reduce the risk of multiple RAT instances running simultaneously.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
