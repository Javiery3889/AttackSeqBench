Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: The threat may be installed through a web browser or by exploiting an application, or through Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
- **Execution**: Regin has a multi-staged architecture with six stages, each performing specific functions.
- **Persistence**: Regin is designed to maintain a long-term presence on infected systems.
- **Defense Evasion**: Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself and its activities.
- **Credential Access**: Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic.
- **Discovery**: Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization, scans for deleted files, and monitors network traffic.
- **Command and Control**: Regin has extensive C&C operations, including bidirectional communications and peer-to-peer communication.
- **Exfiltration**: Regin exfiltrates data through various channels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Regin's discovery capabilities include "gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and retrieving them."
- The question specifically mentions the discovery phase, which aligns with the CTI outline.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions that Regin's discovery capabilities include gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.
- The question asks if Regin is likely to perform these actions during the discovery phase, which is consistent with the CTI outline.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
