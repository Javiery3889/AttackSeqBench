Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Initial Access**: APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
2. **Defense Evasion**: APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection by security software and firewall interception, including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Not directly relevant to the sequence in question.
4. **Command and Control**: APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with "powershell.exe" executing Shellcode scripts.
- **Defense Evasion**: The outline mentions that APT-TOCS uses multi-beacon communication as a defense evasion technique.
- **Execution in Memory**: The outline states that APT-TOCS runs in memory and does not perform hard disk writing operations, which aligns with the execution in memory.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- The attack sequence starts with initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
- The execution in memory is a defense evasion technique, which is mentioned in the "Defense Evasion" section.
- The multi-beacon communication is also a defense evasion technique, but it is not directly linked to the execution in memory.

Given the information, the execution in memory is a core part of the attack, and it is mentioned as a defense evasion technique. However, the question specifically asks if the execution in memory happens only after multi-beacon communication. The outline does not explicitly state that the execution in memory happens only after multi-beacon communication, but it does mention that both are defense evasion techniques.

### Final Answer
Based on the information provided, the execution in memory is a core part of the attack and is a defense evasion technique, but it is not explicitly stated that it happens only after multi-beacon communication. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
