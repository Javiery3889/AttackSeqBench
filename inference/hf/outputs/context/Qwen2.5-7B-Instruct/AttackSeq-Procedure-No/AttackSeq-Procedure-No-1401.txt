Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
2. **Collection**: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
3. **Command and Control**: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
4. **Exfiltration**: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions, it is likely that FIN13 will use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: The CTI outline states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- **Discovery**: The CTI outline mentions that FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
- **Lateral Movement**: The question specifically asks about the use of Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention these tools, but it does mention the use of custom web shells and passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for extended periods within victim environments.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Invoke-WMIExec**: This tool is used for executing commands on remote systems via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). While not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, it is a common tool used in lateral movement.
- **Custom Web Shells (e.g., BUSTEDPIPE)**: These are used for remote access and control, which aligns with the CTI outline's mention of custom web shells for extended periods within victim environments.

### Final Answer
Given the context and the tools mentioned in the CTI outline, it is plausible that FIN13 would use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
