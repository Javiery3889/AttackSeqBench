### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries use worms, scanning tools, and public search engines to detect and infect new hosts.
   - **Resource Development:** Attackers use compromised websites and open-source tools to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports and use of typo-squatting to trick developers into running malicious container images.
   - **Execution:** Abuse of command and script interpreters, use of cmd or entry point, and scheduling local jobs.
   - **Persistence:** Use of LD_PRELOAD and hostPath mount to gain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Use of hostPath mount and chroot to gain control.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Removal of security software and obfuscation of files.
   - **Credential Access:** Use of open-source tools to collect credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Impact:** Cryptocurrency mining and emerging objectives like backdoors and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files, it is likely that attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exfiltration of AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols.
   - The focus of the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is on establishing persistence, privilege escalation, and command and control through C2 servers and proxy tools.
   - The CTI outline does mention credential access, but it does not specify the exfiltration of AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols.

### Final Answer:
Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the exfiltration of AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols. The focus is on establishing and maintaining control through C2 servers and proxy tools.

**Final Answer: B: No**
