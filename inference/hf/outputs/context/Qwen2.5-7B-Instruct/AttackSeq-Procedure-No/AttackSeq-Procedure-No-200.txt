Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use two vectors: compromising a public-facing web service or spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** The first-stage backdoor, "GreyEnergy mini," is dropped, which does not require administrative privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, the attackers map the network and collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - **Lateral Movement:** With domain administrator privileges, the attackers can control the whole network.
   - **Tools Used:** The attackers use Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after compromising a computer and using Nmap and Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. The focus is on the initial compromise, privilege escalation, and the use of standard tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.
   - The question introduces new tools (PDQ Deploy) and malware (AvosLocker) that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. The outline focuses on standard tools and methods that are consistent with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
