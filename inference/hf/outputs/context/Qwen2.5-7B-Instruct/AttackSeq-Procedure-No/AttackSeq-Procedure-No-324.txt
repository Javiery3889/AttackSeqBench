Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on compromised systems, similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is fully functional and runs in the background on iOS 7, but not on iOS 8. It collects various types of information.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and other device information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting information, the malware is likely to initiate an FTP download as part of the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not mention any specific Command and Control (C2) activities, such as FTP downloads, after the discovery phase.
   - The malware's primary function, as described, is to collect information. There is no indication that it would initiate an FTP download or any other C2 activity based on the collected data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware's main purpose, as described, is to gather information from the device.
   - There is no mention of the malware performing any C2 activities, such as initiating FTP downloads.
   - The CTI outline focuses on the malware's capabilities and the information it collects, but does not provide any context about further actions like C2 communications.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the malware would initiate an FTP download as part of the Command and Control phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware would not initiate such an action.

Final Answer: B: No
