Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Initial Access**: Credentials obtained through credential stuffing or password spraying.
- **Persistence**: The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory, without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system. They use systems with high uptimes, such as servers, for persistence.
- **Lateral Movement**: The adversary uses various methods to move laterally, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
- **Command and Control**: The adversary uses Cobalt Strike as a framework for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after obtaining access to the victim's network through compromised remote services, the adversary is likely to rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistence. It does not mention the use of scheduled tasks.
- The question specifically asks about the use of scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory after achieving persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of scheduled tasks for persistence.
- The adversary explicitly uses systems with high uptimes (like servers) for persistence, which aligns with the idea of maintaining a long-term presence.
- There is no indication in the CTI outline that the adversary relies on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that the adversary does not rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory after achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
