### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The 'dstr.dll' plugin is used for data destruction.
     - The 'grc.dll' plugin is used for creating a backup communication channel via Google Plus.
     - The 'usb.dll' plugin is used for collecting information on USB drives.
     - The 'bs.dll' plugin is used for gathering system information using WMI, CPUID, and win32 API calls.
   - **Impact:**
     - The 'dstr.dll' plugin is specifically designed to overwrite data on hard drives, which is an act of sabotage.
     - The 'bs.dll' plugin is used to gather system information, which is a preparatory step before potentially executing other malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlackEnergy2 is likely to use the 'bs.dll' plugin for collecting detailed system information only after executing the 'grc.dll' and 'usb.dll' plugins.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. 'dstr.dll' (data destruction)
     2. 'grc.dll' (backup communication channel)
     3. 'usb.dll' (USB drive information)
     4. 'bs.dll' (system information collection)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state the order of execution for all plugins, but it does provide context that the 'dstr.dll' is used for data destruction, 'grc.dll' for creating a backup communication channel, and 'usb.dll' for collecting USB drive information.
   - The 'bs.dll' plugin is described as being used for gathering system information, which is a preparatory step before potentially executing other malicious activities.
   - The question assumes a specific sequence where 'bs.dll' is used only after 'grc.dll' and 'usb.dll' have been executed. However, the CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence that aligns with this assumption.

### Final Answer:
Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs does not explicitly support the assumption that 'bs.dll' is used only after 'grc.dll' and 'usb.dll' have been executed. The 'bs.dll' plugin is described as a preparatory step for gathering system information, which could be used at any point in the attack lifecycle, not necessarily after the other plugins.

**Final Answer: B: No**
