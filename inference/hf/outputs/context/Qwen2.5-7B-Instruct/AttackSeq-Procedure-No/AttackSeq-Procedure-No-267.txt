Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Resource Development**: The malware is a new Korplug variant named Hodur, used by Mustang Panda.
- **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used, with filenames related to current events.
- **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
- **Persistence**: Persistence is established by creating hidden and system directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
- **Defense Evasion**: Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption.
- **Discovery**: The malware collects extensive system information.
- **Command and Control**: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, which is encrypted using RC4.
- **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol, involving TCP messages with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, which is encrypted using RC4.
- The exfiltration process is described as involving the same custom protocol used for command and control communication.
- There is no mention of a separate process for data exfiltration from network shared drives before the custom TCP-based protocol is used.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not indicate any specific sequence of data collection and exfiltration that would involve a separate step for network shared drives before using the custom TCP-based protocol.
- The malware is described as collecting data and then exfiltrating it via the custom TCP-based protocol, which is consistent with the question's scenario.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware would proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after collecting data from local systems and removable media.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
