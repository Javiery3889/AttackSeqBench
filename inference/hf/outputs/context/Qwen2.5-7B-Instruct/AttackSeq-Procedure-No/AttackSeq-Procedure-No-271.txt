Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
   - **Execution:** Custom loader that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.
   - **Persistence:** Establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and hidden directories.
   - **Discovery:** Collects extensive system information, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, amount of RAM, and display resolution.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with data exfiltration also done over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, the Korplug variant is likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Korplug variant collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This indicates that data collection is a part of the variant's behavior.
   - The question specifically mentions data discovery and data exfiltration over TCP. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that data discovery happens after the data exfiltration, but it does mention that the Korplug variant collects data from various sources, which can be considered a form of data discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline provides evidence that the Korplug variant performs data collection, which aligns with the concept of data discovery.
   - The question asks if the variant is likely to perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP. Given that the variant already collects data from the system, it is reasonable to infer that it would continue to perform data discovery as part of its operations.
   - The answer choices are "Yes" and "No." Based on the information provided, the correct answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
