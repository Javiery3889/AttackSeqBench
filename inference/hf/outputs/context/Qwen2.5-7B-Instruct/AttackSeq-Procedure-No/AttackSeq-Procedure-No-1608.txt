Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy APT group. Here are the key points relevant to the question:

- **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers as entry points.
- **Execution**: They deploy various RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
- **Persistence**: They use malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers for persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: They use decoy documents, images, and cloned websites to evade detection.
- **Collection**: They use modular plugins for specific malicious tasks, such as file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
- **Command and Control**: They use fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
- **Exfiltration**: They target Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India, and deploy njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' to exfiltrate authentication databases.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) servers before targeting Kavach.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific TTPs related to gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.
- The initial access methods described (malicious LNK files, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers) are more aligned with traditional malware delivery methods rather than targeting Azure AD services.
- The collection phase mentions file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging, but does not specifically mention gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.
- The exfiltration phase focuses on targeting Kavach and deploying njRAT malware, which is consistent with the goal of credential harvesting.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that SideCopy targets Azure AD services for initial access.
- The TTPs described in the outline are more focused on traditional malware delivery and credential harvesting.
- There is no mention of any specific TTPs related to gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that SideCopy does not gather encryption keys from Azure AD services as part of their initial access strategy.

**Final Answer: B: No**
