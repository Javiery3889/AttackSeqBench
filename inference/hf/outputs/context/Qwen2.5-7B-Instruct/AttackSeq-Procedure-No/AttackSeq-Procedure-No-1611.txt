Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- **Reconnaissance**: The attack targets Mexican banking institutions and is linked to a Brazilian campaign.
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT), with a malicious attachment.
- **Execution**: The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file triggers the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and runs the main malware.
- **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses VMProtect to evade static analysis.
- **Collection**: The malware accesses Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts.
- **Command and Control**: The script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.
- **Exfiltration**: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after collecting email accounts, the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying text related to an alleged data update request, executing a malicious batch file, and enabling persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attack targets Mexican banking institutions.
- The initial access involves an email impersonating Mexico's tax department.
- The execution phase involves a batch file that triggers a PowerShell script.
- The persistence phase includes creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline matches the scenario in the question.
- The initial access is via an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, which aligns with the alleged data update request.
- The execution phase involves a batch file that triggers a PowerShell script, which is consistent with the question.
- The persistence phase includes creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks, which is also consistent with the question.

Given the alignment of the attack sequence in the CTI outline with the scenario described in the question, the answer is:

**Final Answer: Yes**
