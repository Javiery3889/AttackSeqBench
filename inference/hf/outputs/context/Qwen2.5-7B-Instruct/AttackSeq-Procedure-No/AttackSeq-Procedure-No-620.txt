Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The CTI outline describes the following key TTPs:
1. **Initial Access**: Watering hole attack via malicious links on forums.
2. **Execution**: Installation of lightSpy malware, which includes a modular backdoor for remote command execution and data exfiltration.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Use of a silently patched Safari bug and a customized kernel exploit to gain root privileges, and the use of a legitimate Apple developer certificate.
4. **Collection**: Data exfiltration of various types of information, including hardware information, contacts, text messages, call history, saved WiFi information, browser history, and user location, with specific targeting of data from messenger apps like WeChat, QQ, and Telegram.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after the lightSpy malware has performed data collection, it is likely to use DNS Calculation by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine the command and control port for module updates and data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific TTP related to DNS Calculation or any method of determining command and control ports.
- The outline focuses on the initial access, execution, and collection of data, but does not provide any information about how the malware might determine the command and control port.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that suggests the use of DNS Calculation for determining command and control ports.
- The question asks about a specific method (DNS Calculation) that is not mentioned or implied in the CTI outline.
- Given the lack of relevant information in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware does not use this method for determining command and control ports.

**Final Answer: B: No**
