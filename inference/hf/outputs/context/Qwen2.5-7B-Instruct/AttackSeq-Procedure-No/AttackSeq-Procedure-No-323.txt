Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is installed on already compromised systems and is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is fully functional and runs in the background on iOS 7, but not on iOS 8. It can restart automatically and has a hidden icon.
   - **Discovery:** The app collects various types of information, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the malware, after using a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the Command and Control server, is likely to collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the malware collects text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.
   - The Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix is a communication method and does not affect the types of data collected during the Discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI outline explicitly mentions that the malware collects text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.
   - The Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix is a communication method and does not change the types of data collected.
   - Therefore, the malware is likely to collect the specified information during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
