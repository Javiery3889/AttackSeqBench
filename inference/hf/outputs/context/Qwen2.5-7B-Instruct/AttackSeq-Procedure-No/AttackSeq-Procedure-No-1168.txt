Let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
1. **Resource Development**: The ProjectM actors have developed a significant toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs. They have also utilized the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload.
2. **Initial Access**: The actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
3. **Execution**: The campaign executed malicious code through Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, as well as RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok. Techniques included the exploitation of vulnerabilities and the use of malicious macros.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal their infrastructure, but lapses in this practice revealed connections to an individual potentially involved in the campaign.
5. **Command and Control**: The campaign's C2 infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection, but two domains were linked to an individual's email address. These domains were used to host C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan, which delivered further payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if, after conducting reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains, the ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention reconnaissance or the collection of location information from visitors to phishing sites.
- The outline focuses on the actors' methods of gaining initial access (spear-phishing and watering hole attacks), executing Trojans, and using C2 infrastructure.
- There is no direct mention of collecting location information as part of the attack sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the actors collecting location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the outline does not include any steps related to collecting location information.
- The question asks about a specific step (collection of location information) that is not supported by the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer: B: No
