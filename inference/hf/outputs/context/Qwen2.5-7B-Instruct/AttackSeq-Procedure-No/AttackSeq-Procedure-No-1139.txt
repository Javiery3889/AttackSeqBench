### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The 'Recon' module group collects initial system information, including browser history, software details, and system identifiers. It also checks for custom enterprise software and sends data to C&C servers.
   - **Persistence:** The 'Persistence' module group installs backdoor code in popular applications to regain access if lost.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The 'Spreading' module group scans for other hosts on the network, fingerprints them, and infects them via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.
   - **Exfiltration:** The 'Exfiltration' module group transfers collected data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after deploying the 'Recon' module group, the 'Spreading' module group is likely to attempt to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The 'Recon' module group is the first stage of the attack, gathering information and determining subsequent actions.
   - The 'Persistence' module group is used to maintain access, but it does not directly relate to spreading to other hosts.
   - The 'Spreading' module group is designed to scan and infect other hosts on the network, which is a logical next step after gathering initial information.
   - The 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials, which is a later step in the attack sequence, typically after establishing a foothold and spreading to other hosts.

### Final Answer:
The 'Spreading' module group is likely to attempt to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials. This is because spreading to other hosts is a necessary step to gain a foothold and establish a broader presence in the network before stealing credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
