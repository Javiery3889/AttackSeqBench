### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices.
   - **Resource Development:** They have advanced capabilities to undermine trust in Certificate Authorities and maintain a large, dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sharing sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** Deploy various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** Maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use digital certificates and encryption techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** Target stored secrets in browsers and email services, and terminate on systems with specific codepage settings.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining victim credentials using the information stealer module, The Darkhotel APT is likely to search a victim's network for collaboration platforms like Confluence to discover further high-privilege account credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the APT searching for credentials in collaboration platforms like Confluence.
   - The focus of the CTI outline is on gaining initial access, maintaining persistence, and stealing credentials from browsers and email services.
   - The Darkhotel APT is known for its targeted and sophisticated espionage tools, but the specific mention of searching for credentials in collaboration platforms is not directly supported by the provided information.

### Final Answer:
Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to support the APT searching for credentials in collaboration platforms like Confluence. The focus is more on initial access, persistence, and stealing credentials from browsers and email services.

**Final Answer: B: No**
