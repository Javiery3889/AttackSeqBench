### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the CTI Outline:**
   - **Resource Development:** Packrat created fake online organizations in Venezuela and Ecuador to support their operations.
   - **Initial Access:** Packrat targeted individuals with malware and phishing attacks, often using fake organizations.
   - **Execution:** Packrat used various types of malware, primarily COTS RATs, and employed obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - **Persistence:** Packrat's malware included features for persistence and monitoring.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Packrat used obfuscation techniques and runtime packers to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:** Packrat used specific domains for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Packrat is likely to collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites during the reconnaissance phase before gaining initial access to individuals with malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention collecting location information from visitors to phishing sites. However, it does indicate that Packrat used fake organizations and phishing attacks to target individuals.
   - The outline focuses on the use of malware and phishing, but it does not provide specific details on the reconnaissance phase or the collection of location information.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - While Packrat used phishing and fake organizations, the outline does not provide evidence that they collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
   - **B: No** - Given the lack of specific information about collecting location data, this answer seems more plausible based on the provided CTI outline.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
