To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report describes a cyber attack by the Carbanak group, ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence of tactics mentioned in the report is:
   - Reconnaissance
   - Initial Access
   - Execution
   - Persistence
   - Privilege Escalation
   - Defense Evasion
   - Credential Access
   - Discovery
   - Lateral Movement
   - Collection
   - Exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred after the attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and compromised additional network endpoints. This action is associated with the "Discovery" tactic. The question is asking what happened next to enable communication with compromised systems and to check for new commands to execute.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Discovery tactic involves identifying and mapping the internal network, which the attackers did using the Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - After discovering and mapping the network, and compromising additional endpoints, the attackers would need to establish a way to communicate with these compromised systems and receive new commands. This is essential for maintaining control over the compromised systems and for executing further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already gained access, executed initial payloads, and discovered the network.
   - They need a way to maintain access and control over the compromised systems.
   - The tactic that directly involves communicating with compromised systems and checking for new commands to execute is related to maintaining control and issuing commands.

Given the context and the sequence of events:
- **Resource Development (A)** is not directly related to communicating with compromised systems or executing commands.
- **Execution (B)** involves running malicious code, which is part of what the attackers are doing, but it doesn't specifically address the communication aspect with compromised systems for command execution.
- **Exfiltration (C)** is about stealing data, which, while part of the attack, does not directly relate to the communication and command execution process.
- **Command and Control (D)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems, allowing the attackers to send commands and receive data, which aligns with the need to communicate with compromised systems and check for new commands to execute.

**Final Answer: D**
