To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the Machete campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with links or zipped files containing malicious contents.
     2. **Persistence**: Creating Windows Task Scheduler tasks, using hidden files and directories.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading as legitimate applications.
     4. **Credential Access**: Scanning for key and certificate files, exfiltrating stored credentials.
     5. **Discovery**: Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting devices, producing file listings, enumerating processes.
     6. **Collection**: Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots.
     7. **Command and Control**: Using FTP and HTTP for communication with C&C servers.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Automatically exfiltrating collected files to remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after gaining initial access, involving the use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - The key elements here are the use of a downloader and the installation of backdoor components after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (B)** is the method used to gain access, not what happens after.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A)** involves gaining higher privileges, which is not directly related to the use of a downloader for installing backdoor components.
   - **Command and Control (C)** is about maintaining communication with the compromised system, which could involve downloading additional components but is broader than just the act of installing backdoor components.
   - **Execution (D)** involves executing malicious code, which aligns with the use of a downloader to install backdoor components on the compromised system after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a downloader to install backdoor components after initial access.
   - The CTI report details the initial access method but does not explicitly outline the immediate steps post-access in terms of downloader usage.
   - However, the installation of backdoor components for persistence and the use of various techniques for defense evasion and command and control imply that after gaining access, the next logical step would involve executing or running the malicious code (in this case, a downloader) to install these components.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after initial access, given the context of installing backdoor components, aligns with the **Execution** tactic, as it directly involves running or executing the malicious code necessary for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: D
