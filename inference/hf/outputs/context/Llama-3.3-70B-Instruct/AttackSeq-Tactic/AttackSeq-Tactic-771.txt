To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Darkhotel APT's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics: 
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Initial Access
     4. Execution
     5. Persistence
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Collection
     8. Command and Control
   - Key points include the use of malware posing as software updates, exploiting vulnerabilities, and the use of advanced cryptographic techniques for evasion and data protection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Darkhotel APT evaded detection and targeted stored secrets and credentials.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves evading detection (using digital certificates and encryption) and then targeting stored secrets and credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after evading detection (Defense Evasion), the Darkhotel APT collects various secrets stored on local systems, including cached passwords and credentials from multiple browsers and email services (Collection).
   - The question specifically mentions targeting stored secrets and credentials, which aligns with the Collection tactic but more specifically points towards accessing credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Darkhotel APT uses Defense Evasion tactics to avoid detection.
   - After evading detection, they aim to collect sensitive information, which includes credentials.
   - The tactic that involves collecting credentials, especially from browsers and email services, is closely related to **Credential Access**.
   - Credential Access is the tactic that involves techniques for obtaining or maintaining access to credentials like passwords, keys, or certificates that can be used to access systems, services, or data.

**Final Answer: D**
