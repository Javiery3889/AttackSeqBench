To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the DRAGONFISH threat group using Elise malware.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: The malware is distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes, moves its payload, and injects a DLL into the Internet Explorer process.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs various evasion techniques.
     4. **Discovery**: The malware harvests system information.
     5. **Command and Control**: The malware communicates with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Elise malware moved its payload and executed the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves the execution of the malware and its establishment within the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After the malware injects the DLL into Internet Explorer, the next logical steps based on the report would involve the malware either trying to maintain its presence, evade detection, gather information, or communicate with its C2 server.
   - **Discovery (A)**: This involves gathering information about the system, which could happen after the malware has established itself but doesn't directly relate to the act of moving the payload and executing the DLL.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This is a strong candidate because after establishing itself, the malware would likely communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or send back harvested data.
   - **Persistence (C)**: While persistence is crucial for the malware, the question specifically asks about the tactic after executing the DLL, and persistence mechanisms (like creating a mutex to prevent duplicate executions) are mentioned but not as the primary next step after execution.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic is employed by the malware but is more about avoiding detection rather than a sequential step after execution and establishment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's actions after moving its payload and executing the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer would logically involve communicating with its C2 server to either send harvested data or receive further commands.
   - This communication is essential for the malware's operation and the threat actor's goals, making **Command and Control** the most likely next tactic after the described actions.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the communication between the malware and its C2 server.

Final Answer: B
