To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by Tropic Trooper, starting with **Initial Access** through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - This is followed by **Execution**, where a backdoor installer is dropped, and a malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on a benign file (sidebar.exe) to launch dllhost.exe and inject a DLL backdoor into it.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by the backdoor loading an encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and using SSL to connect to C&C servers.
   - **Command and Control** involves the backdoor (TClient) using SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking through the benign file sidebar.exe to evade antivirus detection.
   - The key event here is the use of DLL hijacking as a method of **Defense Evasion**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - DLL hijacking is a technique used to evade detection by antivirus software, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - After successfully evading detection, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to establish a connection with the C&C server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - The report mentions that after the DLL hijacking, the malicious loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, and then the backdoor proceeds to load an encrypted configuration file and connect to the C&C server using SSL.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of DLL hijacking is a method of **Defense Evasion** (C), which is used to evade antivirus detection.
   - After evading detection, the attacker would likely proceed to establish **Command and Control** (D) to communicate with the C&C server, which is necessary for receiving commands, exfiltrating data, or further compromising the system.
   - Given the context, **Command and Control** is the most likely tactic to occur after successfully evading antivirus detection through DLL hijacking.

**Final Answer: D**
