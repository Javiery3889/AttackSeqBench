To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the GreyEnergy group's attack sequence starting with Initial Access, where they compromise a public-facing web service or use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - After the initial access, they use tools like "GreyEnergy mini" to map the network and collect passwords.
   - With collected passwords, they obtain domain administrator privileges, utilizing tools such as Mimikatz.
   - The report mentions the use of standard tools like Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and password collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when GreyEnergy used PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network, after obtaining domain administrator privileges.
   - The tools mentioned (PsExec and WinExe) are typically used for executing commands or programs on remote computers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already obtained domain administrator privileges and are now using tools like PsExec and WinExe, we need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic.
   - **Initial Access (B)** is incorrect because the initial access has already been achieved through compromised web services or spearphishing.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)** is also incorrect because the attackers have already obtained domain administrator privileges.
   - **Persistence (A)** could be a consideration but doesn't directly relate to the action of spreading across the network using PsExec and WinExe.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)** is the most appropriate choice because it involves moving laterally within a network, which aligns with the use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network after gaining access and escalating privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first gain initial access to the network.
   - They then escalate their privileges using tools like Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator rights.
   - With these privileges, they use tools like PsExec and WinExe to move laterally across the network, spreading their control.
   - Therefore, the action of using PsExec and WinExe to spread across the network after obtaining domain administrator privileges best aligns with the ATT&CK tactic of Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: D
