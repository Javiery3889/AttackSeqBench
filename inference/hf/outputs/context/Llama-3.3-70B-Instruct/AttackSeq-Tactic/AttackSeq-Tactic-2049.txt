To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an iOS malware used in Operation Pawn Storm.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Discovery**: The malware collects various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.
   - **Command and Control**: The malware sends collected information via HTTP and receives commands, with the capability to upload files via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the malware installation but before it started gathering information.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the period after the malware is installed and before the data collection begins.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access** has already occurred, as the malware is installed on compromised systems.
   - **Discovery** is the tactic where the malware collects information, which is what we are looking for as the "after" point in the sequence.
   - Before **Discovery**, the malware needs to be executed or set up to start its information-gathering activities.
   - **Execution** (A) refers to the tactic of running the malware, which would logically occur after installation and before the malware can start its discovery (information-gathering) activities.
   - **Resource Development** (B) involves establishing resources that can be used for operations, which might not directly relate to the immediate post-installation phase of the malware.
   - **Command and Control** (C) is crucial for the malware's operation but is more about maintaining communication with the C2 server than preparing for the initial data collection.
   - **Discovery** (D) is the tactic of gathering information, which is what we're looking for as happening "after" the point in question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware is installed (Initial Access).
   - For the malware to start collecting information (Discovery), it must first be executed or set up to run, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after the malware is installed, it needs to be executed to start its information-gathering activities.

Final Answer: A
