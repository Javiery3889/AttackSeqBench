To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions the use of open-source tools like Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, and Invoke-Obfuscation for defense evasion.
   - It talks about the use of GitHub for hosting the backdoor, POWERSTATS, and its compilation using PS2EXE.
   - Command and Control (C2) communication was facilitated through various domains and compromised sites.
   - The report also mentions the use of compromised accounts at third-party organizations to send malware.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with the attackers using GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents.
   - This is followed by the use of open-source tools for defense evasion and command and control communications.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved before the use of open-source tools and techniques like PS2EXE and Invoke-Obfuscation.
   - It specifically mentions utilizing GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of GitHub-hosted backdoors and malicious documents to compromise systems aligns with the initial stages of an attack, where the goal is to gain access to the target system.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines "Initial Access" as the tactic used by attackers to gain initial access to a network.
   - "Command and Control" (A) is about maintaining communication with compromised systems, which happens after initial access.
   - "Defense Evasion" (C) involves techniques used to evade detection, which is what the use of PS2EXE and Invoke-Obfuscation is related to, but it's not about gaining initial access.
   - "Reconnaissance" (D) is about gathering information about the target before an attack, which doesn't directly involve using backdoors or malicious documents to compromise systems.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic involved in the initial compromise using GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents.
   - This action is aimed at gaining initial access to the target systems.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this action is "Initial Access".
   
Final Answer: B
