To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca, a threat actor, in a cyber attack. The tactics mentioned, in order, are:
   - Reconnaissance
   - Initial Access
   - Execution
   - Persistence
   - Privilege Escalation
   - Defense Evasion
   - Credential Access
   - Discovery
   - Collection
   - Command and Control
   - Exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK tactic after Earth Lusca used tools for discovery (like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan) and then exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of discovery tools, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the report.
   - After discovering machines in the network, the next steps involve exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing. This action is aimed at moving laterally within the network, establishing a presence in other systems, and potentially escalating privileges or evading defenses to maintain access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Discovery** is about identifying systems, services, and other assets within the network.
   - **Exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing** to transfer tools and establish network tunnels suggests an attempt to **move laterally** within the network. This is a common next step after discovery, as it allows the threat actor to expand their reach, gain access to more sensitive areas, and potentially find more valuable data.
   - **Lateral Movement** involves techniques that enable the threat actor to access and control remote systems on a network, often to find and exfiltrate sensitive data or to use as a pivot point for further attacks.
   - While **Defense Evasion** and **Reconnaissance** are also relevant tactics, they do not directly follow the action of discovering machines and then exploiting services and using spear phishing as a means to an end. **Defense Evasion** is more about avoiding detection, and **Reconnaissance** is more about gathering information, which has already been done in this context.
   - **Discovery** is what has just been completed with the use of scanning tools, so it's not the next step.

**Final Answer: C**
