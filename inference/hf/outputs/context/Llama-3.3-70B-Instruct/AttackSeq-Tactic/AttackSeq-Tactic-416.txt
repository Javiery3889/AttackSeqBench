To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** through the exploitation of a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
   - The actors then use the webshell for **Execution** of various commands and uploading tools.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are employed to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access** is achieved using Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Discovery** involves running commands to understand the system and network.
   - **Command and Control** is maintained through the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the actors used Mimikatz for credential dumping and executed reconnaissance commands. Specifically, it's about leveraging collected credentials to execute commands on other systems using webshells.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key actions mentioned in the question are the use of credentials (obtained through Mimikatz) to execute commands on other systems. This implies movement from the initially compromised system to other systems within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement (A)** involves moving from one system to another, often to gain greater access or control. This tactic aligns with the action of using collected credentials to execute commands on other systems.
   - **Reconnaissance (B)** is about gathering information, which has already been done according to the question.
   - **Credential Access (C)** is the process of obtaining credentials, which has also been completed as per the question.
   - **Discovery (D)** involves finding information about the system and network, which is also mentioned as already done.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies actions that follow credential dumping and reconnaissance, focusing on the use of those credentials to access other systems.
   - The described action of leveraging credentials to execute commands on other systems directly aligns with the definition of **Lateral Movement**, as it involves using the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic in this context is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: A
