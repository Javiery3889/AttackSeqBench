To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by the IndigoZebra APT group.
   - The sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through spear-phishing.
     2. **Execution**: The dropper executes and drops a backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: The backdoor establishes persistence through a registry key.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses obfuscation.
     5. **Discovery**: The threat actor conducts fingerprinting and reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK tactic after discovery activities, specifically to control infected systems using Dropbox as an intermediary.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves discovery activities followed by an unknown tactic that involves using Dropbox for control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the latest variant of the backdoor, BoxCaon, uses Dropbox for C&C (Command and Control) communication.
   - Given that the question specifies the use of Dropbox as an intermediary for controlling infected systems, this implies communication between the infected system and the threat actor.
   - **Discovery** (A) has already occurred according to the question, so it's not the next step.
   - **Persistence** (B) is about maintaining access, which is crucial but not directly related to using Dropbox for communication.
   - **Exfiltration** (C) involves stealing data, which might be a goal but doesn't directly relate to controlling infected systems via Dropbox.
   - **Command and Control** (D) is about maintaining control over compromised systems, which aligns with using Dropbox as an intermediary for communication between the threat actor and the infected system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies activities post-discovery that involve using Dropbox for controlling infected systems.
   - The use of Dropbox as mentioned in the CTI report is associated with the BoxCaon backdoor for C&C communication.
   - Therefore, the most logical next step after discovery, given the context of using Dropbox for intermediary control, is establishing or utilizing **Command and Control** mechanisms.

Final Answer: D
