To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines a cyber attack campaign named Operation Earth Kitsune.
   - **Initial Access**: Watering hole tactics were used, exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to deliver malware.
   - **Execution**: Malware execution involved exploiting Chrome and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities to download and execute additional malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: A PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Checks for security software were implemented to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control**: The SLUB malware variant communicated with a Mattermost server for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration**: System information was exfiltrated to the Mattermost server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after implementing checks for security software (Defense Evasion) but before the SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server (Command and Control) to collect system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **After Defense Evasion**: The attackers have already implemented checks to avoid detection by security software.
   - **Before Command and Control (with Mattermost server)**: The interaction with the Mattermost server for collecting system information hasn't happened yet.
   - Given this sequence, we're looking for an action that fits between evading defenses and establishing command and control for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Defense Evasion** has already occurred, as the attackers checked for security software.
   - **Command and Control** with the Mattermost server for system information collection is the next known step after the question's timeframe.
   - **Initial Access** and **Execution** have already happened, as the malware is already on the system and has executed.
   - **Privilege Escalation** could potentially fit here, but it's not directly related to the interaction with the C2 server for data collection.
   - **Collection** (Answer Choice A) involves gathering information about the system, which would logically occur after the malware has established itself on the system (post-Defense Evasion) and before or as part of interacting with the C2 server for exfiltration purposes.
   - **Discovery** (Answer Choice D) could be considered, but it's more about the attackers learning about the system and network, which might not directly precede the interaction with the Mattermost server in this context.

**Final Answer**: A
