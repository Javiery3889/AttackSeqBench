To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through compromised systems, leading to the installation of iOS malware.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that can hide its icon, run in the background, and restart after termination on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase involves the collection of various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after collecting information from the iOS device to send the data out via HTTP and receive commands from the attacker.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves data collection followed by the exfiltration of this data and the establishment of a communication channel for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The collected data needs to be sent out to the attackers, which implies a need for communication between the compromised device and the attacker's infrastructure.
   - The question specifically mentions sending data out via HTTP and receiving commands, which aligns with the concept of establishing and maintaining a communication channel between the compromised device and the attacker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** and **Execution** have already occurred, as the malware is installed and running on the device.
   - **Discovery** is the phase where data collection happens, which is described in the report and is a precursor to the action described in the question.
   - The action of sending collected data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker best fits the **Command and Control** tactic. This is because Command and Control (C2) involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised device and the attacker's command and control server to exchange data (such as exfiltrating stolen information) and to receive commands (to execute further malicious activities).

**Final Answer: B**
