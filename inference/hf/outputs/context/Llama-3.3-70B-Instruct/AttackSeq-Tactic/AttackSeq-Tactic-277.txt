To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN8 group, focusing on the BADHATCH backdoor.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Using BADHATCH to gain initial access.
     2. **Execution**: BADHATCH operates in CMD or POWERSHELL mode to execute various commands.
     3. **Persistence**: Using WMI event subscription and creating a WMI object for code injection.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Involves executing a script (sh-tmp.ps1) that likely escalates privileges.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Employing TLS encryption, masquerading communication, and using a proxy.
     6. **Credential Access**: Suggested by the execution of a script (mimi.ps1) related to Mimikatz.
     7. **Discovery**: Conducting system fingerprinting and discovering the Domain Controller and domain trust using various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after discovering the Domain Controller and performing domain trust discovery.
   - It mentions using `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The discovery of the Domain Controller and domain trust discovery falls under the **Discovery** tactic.
   - Using `wmic.exe` to execute a script on the Domain Controller implies moving laterally within the network, as it involves accessing and executing code on a different system (in this case, the Domain Controller) than the initial entry point.
   - **Lateral Movement** is the tactic that involves moving from one system to another within the network, often to gain access to more sensitive data or systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The FIN8 group has already gained initial access and conducted discovery activities.
   - The use of `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller indicates an attempt to spread within the network, specifically targeting a critical system (the Domain Controller).
   - This action aligns with the **Lateral Movement** tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on a remote system (the Domain Controller) to potentially gain further access or control within the network.
   - Therefore, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic after discovering the Domain Controller and performing domain trust discovery is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: B
