To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by an APT group using DLL side-loading for execution.
   - The techniques used include Defense Evasion through DLL side-loading and encryption of payloads.
   - The group targeted non-governmental organizations in Myanmar, suggesting involvement of a Chinese APT group.
   - The report mentions the use of a malicious DLL to execute code, followed by defense evasion techniques, and then preparation for data exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Execution**: DLL side-loading to execute malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Using clean loaders to load malicious DLLs, encrypting payloads, and concealing malware.
   - **Exfiltration**: Preparing the system for data exfiltration by creating a 'Recycle Bin' folder mimic on removable and non-system drives and collecting system information.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the APT group used a malicious DLL payload to establish a remote connection.
   - The key detail here is the establishment of a remote connection back to a server, which implies communication between the compromised system and a command and control (C2) server.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Establishing a remote connection to a server (IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999) suggests that the APT group is setting up a channel for command and control (C2) communications.
   - This action would logically follow the initial execution and defense evasion phases, as the group would need to establish a means to issue commands and receive stolen data.
   - **Command and Control (C)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the C2 server, which aligns with the action of establishing a remote connection.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The APT group executes malicious code using DLL side-loading.
   - They employ defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - After establishing a foothold, they would need to communicate with the compromised system, which involves setting up a C2 channel.
   - The action of establishing a remote connection back to a server directly supports the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
