To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the Stuxnet worm's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, and Command and Control.
   - Key points include:
     - **Initial Access**: Exploited CVE-2010-2568 via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
     - **Execution**: Ran malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers for injecting code and hiding files.
     - **Persistence**: Installed kernel-mode drivers and modified system files for persistence.
     - **Privilege Escalation**: Used zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Employed rootkit functionality, used stolen digital certificates, and patched system libraries to evade detection.
     - **Command and Control**: Communicated with C&C servers via HTTP, sending system information and receiving commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Stuxnet used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates for evasion, specifically in the context of exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - The question mentions specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061) not directly detailed in the provided report but implies a scenario of network spreading.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report does not explicitly mention the exploitation of MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities but discusses Stuxnet's ability to spread through networks.
   - The use of rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates is associated with **Defense Evasion**.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems aligns with **Lateral Movement**, which involves techniques for moving within a network after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the ATT&CK tactics involved in the scenario. The question mentions Defense Evasion techniques (rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates) but asks about the tactic involved in spreading across networked systems.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that exploiting vulnerabilities like MS08-067 and MS10-061 for spreading is a method of moving laterally within a network.
   - **Step 3**: Match the described actions with the ATT&CK tactics. Defense Evasion is about avoiding detection, but the action of spreading through a network by exploiting vulnerabilities fits **Lateral Movement**.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of spreading across networked systems by exploiting specific vulnerabilities after employing evasion techniques, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: C
