To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via an INP file exploiting CVE-2017-12824.
   - This is followed by **Execution**, where the second PE file checks the environment, creates persistence, and targets the explorer process.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through a RunOnce key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include checking for debuggers and using Process Hollowing.
   - **Discovery** involves obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after using **Process Hollowing** for defense evasion and performing **Discovery** to identify the explorer process.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves defense evasion and discovery, and we are looking for the next likely tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already gained access, executed its initial payload, established persistence, evaded defenses, and performed some discovery, the next logical steps would involve either further interaction with the compromised system or communicating with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Process Hollowing** is used for defense evasion, indicating the malware is trying to hide its communications or actions.
   - The use of **CreateToolhelp32snapshot** to identify the explorer process suggests the malware is looking for specific processes to interact with, possibly for further exploitation or to maintain access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already executed its initial payload and established persistence, so **Execution (A)** might not be the immediate next step in terms of the overall attack sequence, although execution of further payloads or commands is possible.
   - **Discovery (B)** has been partially achieved through identifying the explorer process, but the question implies looking for the next tactic after this point.
   - **Command and Control (C)** seems likely because, after establishing persistence and evading defenses, the malware would need to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. The use of Process Hollowing for communication suggests an attempt to hide this interaction.
   - **Collection (D)** could be a part of the malware's goals but seems less directly related to the immediate next step after defense evasion and initial discovery.

Given the context and the steps outlined, the most plausible next ATT&CK tactic after using Process Hollowing for defense evasion and performing discovery would be to establish or utilize **Command and Control** for further instructions or data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
