To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a supply chain attack where the attackers compromised the MiMi chat application installers by modifying the electron-main.js file with malicious JavaScript code.
   - The malicious code downloads and executes the rshell executable, a backdoor that communicates with a command and control (C&C) server.
   - The backdoor collects OS information, receives commands, executes them, and sends the results back to the C&C server.
   - The report mentions that the attackers used unsigned installers, requiring users to bypass macOS security warnings, which is an example of Defense Evasion.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Initial Access**: The attackers gained access to the MiMi chat developer's backend through a supply chain attack.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The attackers used unsigned installers and modified code to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control**: The rshell executable established communication with the C&C server.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Iron Tiger gained access to the MiMi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers.
   - Given that the initial access has already occurred, we are looking for the next step in the attack sequence.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This has already occurred according to the question, so it's not the next step.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This is a plausible next step as the attackers would need to evade defenses to maintain access and execute their malicious code.
   - **Exfiltration (B)**: While exfiltration could occur after initial access, the report primarily focuses on the establishment of command and control and defense evasion rather than data exfiltration.
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources such as domains, servers, or code repositories that can be used for future operations. While it's a possible step in the broader campaign, it's less directly related to the immediate actions following initial access in the context provided.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first gained initial access through a supply chain attack.
   - To execute their malicious code and establish a backdoor, they would need to evade the system's defenses, which aligns with Defense Evasion.
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after gaining access, and given the context, Defense Evasion is the most direct next step to ensure the malicious code can run without being detected.

**Final Answer: D**
