To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT15 that started with **Initial Access** to the victim's network, where they compromised over 30 hosts.
   - They used **Mimikatz** to gain **domain administrator credentials** for **Privilege Escalation**.
   - APT15 deployed backdoors, including **RoyalCLI**, which bypasses policy settings to enable command prompt execution.
   - The report also mentions **Persistence** through the RoyalDNS backdoor, **Credential Access** for obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, and **Collection** of data from various sources.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely followed the gain of domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, specifically enabling the RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After gaining domain administrator credentials (Privilege Escalation), APT15 would need to ensure they can execute commands without being detected or restricted by the system's security policies.
   - The RoyalCLI backdoor's ability to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution directly relates to evading detection and maintaining access.
   - **Defense Evasion** is the tactic that involves techniques to evade detection and bypass security controls, which aligns with the functionality of the RoyalCLI backdoor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key action (gaining domain administrator credentials) and the subsequent action (enabling RoyalCLI to bypass policy settings).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that bypassing policy settings to execute commands falls under evading security controls.
   - **Step 3**: Match this with the ATT&CK tactics provided in the answer choices.
   - **Conclusion**: The tactic that most likely followed the gain of domain administrator credentials, enabling the RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings, is **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: A
