To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the T9000 malware's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Collection, and Exfiltration.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - **Collection**: T9000 captures data about the infected system, steals specific files, and targets Skype communications.
     - **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files, which are compressed, encrypted, and sent to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Collection phase to send encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a C2 server.
   - The question focuses on the action of sending stolen data to a C2 server, which implies communication with a command and control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The **Collection** phase involves gathering data, which is what T9000 does by capturing system data and stealing information like Skype communications.
   - The action of sending this collected data to a C2 server involves communicating with a command and control server to exfiltrate the data.
   - **Exfiltration** is the tactic that involves transferring data from the victim system to the attacker, but the question specifically mentions sending encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a C2 server, which is a part of establishing and maintaining communication with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the action of sending encrypted data to a C2 server after the Collection phase.
   - The **Exfiltration** tactic is about transferring data from the victim to the attacker, which aligns with sending stolen data.
   - However, the specific action of sending data to a C2 server over a specified port is more closely related to the **Command and Control** tactic, as it involves the communication between the malware and the C2 server to exfiltrate the data.
   - Given the focus on sending data to a C2 server, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is **Command and Control**, as it directly involves the communication necessary for exfiltrating the stolen data.

Final Answer: D
