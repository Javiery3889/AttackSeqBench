To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the report is:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attack was initiated through the delivery of weaponized malware embedded in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
     2. **Persistence**: The malware persisted in the Windows XP embedded version located at the Chinese manufacturer's support website.
     3. **Discovery**: The malware began an automated attack using the SMB protocol and then the RADMIN protocol to infect servers, specifically targeting those with 'finance' in their hostname and compromising the ERP financial server.
     4. **Exfiltration**: All financial data and ERP data were exfiltrated.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the malware successfully targeted servers with 'finance' in their hostname and compromised the ERP financial server during the discovery phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves the compromise of specific servers and then an action that follows this compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The discovery phase, as described, involves the identification and compromise of specific servers (those with 'finance' in their hostname) and the ERP financial server.
   - After compromising these servers, the next logical step in the attack sequence, based on the report, would be to exfiltrate data from these compromised systems, as the attackers would likely want to utilize the access gained to steal sensitive information.
   - **Exfiltration** is the tactic that directly follows the successful compromise of the targeted servers, as it involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report outlines an attack sequence that progresses from initial access, through persistence, discovery (where specific servers are compromised), and then to exfiltration of data.
   - The question specifically asks for the tactic following the compromise of 'finance' servers during the discovery phase.
   - Given the sequence of events and the goals of the attack (gaining situational awareness and visibility into the logistics/shipping company's operations), the most logical next step after compromising the ERP financial server is to exfiltrate the data.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the malware successfully targeted and compromised the ERP financial server is **Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: A
