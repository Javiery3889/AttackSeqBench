To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the T9000 malware's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution**: Involved sideloading a malicious DLL using a legitimate Microsoft executable.
     3. **Persistence**: Established through modifying registry keys and injecting a library into the explorer.exe process.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Designed to evade detection by customizing its installation and using a multi-stage process.
     5. **Collection**: Captured data about the infected system, stole specific files, and targeted Skype communications.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after T9000 communicated with a C2 server to securely move stolen data out of the victim environment.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves communication with a C2 server and then an action to move stolen data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after collecting data, T9000 communicates with a C2 server, sending encrypted traffic that includes collected information.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic used to move stolen data out of the victim environment after this communication.
   - **Exfiltration** is the tactic that involves transferring data from a compromised system to an external system or location, which aligns with moving stolen data out of the victim environment.
   - **Privilege Escalation** involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not directly related to moving data out.
   - **Discovery** involves gathering information about the system or network, which is the opposite of what's being asked.
   - **Command and Control** is the tactic used for communication between the malware and the C2 server, which has already occurred according to the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The T9000 malware communicates with a C2 server as part of its **Command and Control** tactic.
   - The question asks for the tactic that follows this communication, specifically for moving stolen data out.
   - **Exfiltration** is the tactic that directly involves moving data from the compromised system to an external location.
   - Therefore, after communicating with the C2 server, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur for securely moving stolen data out of the victim environment is **Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: D
