To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Reconnaissance**, where the attackers gather information for potential exploitation.
   - **Initial Access** is gained through malicious documents containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader.
   - **Execution** occurs as the macro executes, leading to the download of the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery** involves the Rising Sun implant gathering system and network information.
   - **Exfiltration** is done by encrypting data and sending it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance, specifically to establish communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves reconnaissance followed by communication with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the **Discovery** phase (where the Rising Sun implant gathers system and network information), the next relevant phase is **Exfiltration**, where data is sent to the control server.
   - Establishing communication with control servers for the purpose of sending (exfiltrating) data aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic, as this involves bidirectional communication to control the malware and exfiltrate data.
   - **Resource Development** is not directly related to the act of communicating with control servers for data exfiltration.
   - **Discovery** has already occurred according to the question stem, so it's not the next step.
   - **Privilege Escalation** is not mentioned in the context of communicating with control servers or the described sequence of events.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of encrypted HTTP POST requests to establish communication with control servers after the initial reconnaissance.
   - This action is part of maintaining control over the compromised system and exfiltrating data, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - The CTI report details the use of HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, which is a method used in command and control communications.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial reconnaissance, given the context of establishing communication with control servers, is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: A
