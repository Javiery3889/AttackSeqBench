To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where the execution of a payload occurs after macros are enabled in malicious documents.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned or implied in the report includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: This is implied as the starting point, where social engineering is used to trick victims into enabling macros.
     2. **Execution**: After enabling macros, the payload executes, creating files and executing scripts.
     3. **Persistence**: The path to a VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation and bypassing AppLocker are used.
     5. **Discovery** and **Collection**: The backdoor collects machine information and takes screenshots.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communication with the C&C server is established.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after social engineering was used to trick victims into enabling macros.
   - Social engineering leading to enabling macros falls under **Initial Access**.
   - The question essentially asks for the next step after **Initial Access**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that **Initial Access** involves gaining an initial foothold into the system (in this case, through social engineering to enable macros), the next logical step would be the **Execution** of the malicious payload.
   - **Execution** is directly related to the actions taken by the malware after the initial access is gained, such as running scripts, creating files, and establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sequence of events starting with social engineering to enable macros, which aligns with **Initial Access**.
   - After **Initial Access**, the next step in the attack sequence described is the **Execution** of the payload, which includes running scripts and creating files.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur after social engineering (enabling macros) is **Execution**.

Final Answer: A
