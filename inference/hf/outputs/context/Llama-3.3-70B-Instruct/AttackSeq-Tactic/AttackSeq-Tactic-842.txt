To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's tools and tactics, which include Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - The sequence of tactics as presented is:
     1. Defense Evasion: Longhorn's tools avoid detection.
     2. Discovery: Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
     3. Collection: The malware has capabilities for remote control and customization for espionage operations.
     4. Command and Control: Longhorn configures specific domains and IP addresses for C&C servers.
     5. Exfiltration: The malware communicates externally with upload limits and randomization to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Longhorn employed practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting.
   - These practices are mentioned under "Defense Evasion."

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions practices associated with "Defense Evasion," which includes in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.
   - Given that Defense Evasion is about avoiding detection and the mentioned practices are part of it, we need to find a tactic that logically precedes the need for evasion techniques.
   - "Initial Access" is the tactic where an attacker first gains access to a system or network, which would logically precede the use of evasion techniques to maintain access without being detected.
   - "Exfiltration" is about data transfer out of the target system, which would typically occur after the attacker has already gained access and is trying to avoid detection while extracting data.
   - "Discovery" involves the attacker exploring the system or network, which could occur after initial access and before or concurrently with evasion techniques being employed.
   - "Defense Evasion" itself cannot occur before the practices it encompasses, so it's not a correct choice.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The practices mentioned (in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols) are part of Defense Evasion.
   - For these practices to be necessary, the attacker must have already gained access to the system.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before employing these Defense Evasion practices is gaining "Initial Access" to the system.
   - **Final Answer: D**
