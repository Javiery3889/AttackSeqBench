To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a multi-stage attack by APT Blind Eagle.
   - The stages involve various tactics including Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, and Command and Control.
   - Key tactics mentioned include loading a PowerShell script, using an AMSI bypass method, obfuscating scripts and registry values, and utilizing a remote access tool (RAT) for command and control.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned include PowerShell (T1059.001), Scripting (T1064), Startup Folder (T1547.001), among others.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Blind Eagle utilized a PowerShell script to load a DLL into memory.
   - This implies we are looking for an initial or preparatory phase of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The tactic of loading a PowerShell script to load a DLL into memory is classified under Execution (T1059.001).
   - Given the context, we need to identify which tactic would logically precede this action in an attack sequence.
   - **Persistence (A)** refers to techniques used to maintain access to a system. This would not precede the execution of malicious payloads but rather follow it to ensure continued access.
   - **Impact (B)** refers to the tactics used to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. This would typically occur after the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Initial Access (C)** refers to the tactics used to gain initial access to a system. This would logically precede the execution of any malicious payloads, including the loading of a PowerShell script.
   - **Execution (D)** is the tactic that involves executing malicious code, which is what the question describes as the action taken by Blind Eagle.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution of malicious payloads via a PowerShell script.
   - Given the attack sequence, the most logical precursor to executing malicious code (in this case, loading a DLL into memory via a PowerShell script) would be gaining access to the system.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Blind Eagle utilized a PowerShell script to load a DLL into memory is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: C
