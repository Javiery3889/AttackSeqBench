To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** via Spearphishing Attachment (T1193).
   - The attack then moves to **Execution** using a hidden object in an Excel document that exploits CVE-2017-11882 (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are employed, including file deletion, hiding files and directories, and software packing.
   - The attack involves **Credential Access** techniques to gather stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Collection** of data from the local system occurs.
   - Finally, **Command and Control** is established, with stolen credentials sent to a command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK tactic after stolen credentials are sent to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves the sending of stolen credentials, which aligns with the **Command and Control** phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the credentials have been sent to the command and control server, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve utilizing these credentials or the established command and control channel for further malicious activities.
   - **Initial Access (A)** is unlikely because the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Exfiltration (B)** is a plausible next step, as the attackers might use the stolen credentials or the command and control channel to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system.
   - **Command and Control (C)** is already in place, as indicated by the sending of stolen credentials to the command and control server.
   - **Credential Access (D)** has also already occurred, as the attackers have collected credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack sequence described in the CTI report outlines a progression from initial access through to command and control.
   - The question specifically asks about the next step after establishing command and control and sending stolen credentials.
   - Given the logical progression of a cyber attack, after command and control is established and credentials are exfiltrated to the attacker, the next step would typically involve using the established access for further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next ATT&CK tactic, considering the sequence and the context provided, is **Exfiltration**, as it aligns with the typical goals of an attacker post-command and control establishment.

Final Answer: B
