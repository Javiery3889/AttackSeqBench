To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that starts with **Reconnaissance** through phishing emails.
   - **Initial Access** is gained via these phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Execution** occurs when the VBS macro in the Word document executes a PowerShell script.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used by the PowerShell script to operate in memory and avoid detection.
   - **Impact** is observed with the execution of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the PowerShell script avoided detection and executed downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - This scenario is described under **Defense Evasion** in the report, where the script operates in memory and uses a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the sequence of events: after the PowerShell script executes and avoids detection, the next logical step involves the actual execution of the malware (GandCrab and Ursnif) which leads to further malicious activities.
   - **GandCrab** encrypts files, and **Ursnif** performs actions like credential harvesting and potentially deploying additional malware.
   - Given these actions, we need to determine which ATT&CK tactic they align with.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Defense Evasion (B)** has already occurred as described in the question, so it's not the next step.
   - **Execution (C)** is the tactic where the malicious code (in this case, the PowerShell script and subsequently the malware) is run. However, the question asks for the tactic after the script has already executed and evaded detection.
   - **Command and Control (D)** could be a part of the process but is more related to the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control servers, which isn't directly implied as the immediate next step after evasion.
   - **Credential Access (A)** is a tactic that involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the actions of Ursnif malware mentioned in the report, such as credential harvesting.

**Final Answer**: A
