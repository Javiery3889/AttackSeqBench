To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents.
   - Upon execution, these documents initiate a multi-step process involving the download and execution of various files, ultimately leading to the installation of a main payload.
   - The report mentions **Defense Evasion** tactics, specifically the use of a UAC bypass module to prevent User Account Control pop-ups when moving files to the System32 folder.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with malicious documents.
   - Execution: Multi-step process involving batch files and scripts to download and execute the main payload.
   - Defense Evasion: UAC bypass to execute malware without user alert.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after executing the batch file that installed the main payload, specifically involving gaining elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the action of bypassing UAC to gain elevated privileges after the main payload's installation.
   - The CTI report mentions the use of a UAC bypass module as part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic, which aligns with the action described in the question.
   - However, the question specifically asks about gaining elevated privileges, which is more closely related to **Privilege Escalation** in the ATT&CK framework. The UAC bypass is a technique used to achieve this escalation.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The CTI report details an attack sequence that includes executing a main payload.
   - The execution of this payload involves evading defenses, specifically bypassing UAC.
   - Bypassing UAC is a method to gain elevated privileges without user intervention.
   - In the ATT&CK framework, gaining elevated privileges is categorized under **Privilege Escalation**.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the focus on bypassing UAC to gain elevated privileges after the execution of the main payload, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is **Privilege Escalation**.

Final Answer: D
