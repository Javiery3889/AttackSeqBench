To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the tactics used by APT10, a China-based threat actor, in the order of MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - Key points include the use of spear phishing for initial access, deployment of malware like Quasar RAT for remote access, use of mimikatz for credential theft, and internal reconnaissance for network mapping.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT10 used tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network.
   - The tools mentioned (Quasar RAT and mimikatz) are associated with establishing remote access and stealing credentials, respectively.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Quasar RAT** is used for remote access, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic, allowing the actor to establish a foothold and potentially propagate within the network.
   - **Mimikatz** is used for credential theft, which is part of **Credential Access**, enabling the actor to gain legitimate credentials for further movement or privilege escalation.
   - The question specifies that these actions occurred before internal reconnaissance (which is part of the **Discovery** tactic) to map the network.
   - Given the sequence, after gaining access and before mapping the network, the actor would likely focus on maintaining their presence and ensuring they can continue to access the network, which involves **Persistence**.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT10 uses spear phishing for **Initial Access**.
   - They deploy malware like Quasar RAT for **Execution**, establishing a foothold.
   - The use of mimikatz indicates **Credential Access** to obtain legitimate credentials.
   - Before conducting **Discovery** (internal reconnaissance to map the network), the most logical step after establishing access and obtaining credentials would be to ensure **Persistence**, so the malware remains active despite system reboots, allowing for continued access and further operations like lateral movement and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
