To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT Blind Eagle, detailing the stages of the attack from initial access to the deployment of a remote access tool (RAT).
   - The stages include:
     1. **Initial Access**: Utilizing a JavaScript downloader to execute PowerShell commands.
     2. **Execution**: Loading a DLL to bypass AMSI, creating a registry key, dropping files, and setting up a VBScript for persistence.
     3. **Persistence**: Ensuring the malware persists through system restarts via a VBScript in the Startup folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using AMSI bypass and obfuscation to evade detection.
     5. The final stage involves decrypting registry content to deploy the njRAT remote access tool.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the attacker decrypted the obfuscated registry content and deployed the njRAT remote access tool.
   - The tactics provided as answer choices are:
     - A: Defense Evasion
     - B: Command and Control
     - C: Resource Development
     - D: Initial Access

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After deploying the njRAT remote access tool, the attacker would likely use it to communicate with the compromised system, issue commands, and potentially exfiltrate data or move laterally within the network.
   - **Defense Evasion (A)** might continue to be used throughout the attack, but it's not the primary tactic after deploying a RAT.
   - **Command and Control (B)** is the most relevant tactic after deploying a RAT, as it involves establishing a channel for commanding and controlling the compromised system.
   - **Resource Development (C)** could be a part of the attack, but it's less directly related to the immediate actions following the deployment of a RAT.
   - **Initial Access (D)** has already occurred and is not relevant to the actions taken after deploying a RAT.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the actions taken after the deployment of the njRAT remote access tool.
   - Deploying a RAT like njRAT is primarily a step towards establishing control over the compromised system.
   - The most logical next step after gaining control is to use that control to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or move laterally, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attacker decrypted the obfuscated registry content and deployed the njRAT remote access tool is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: B
