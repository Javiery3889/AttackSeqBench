To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the FHAPPI campaign, which starts with **Initial Access** via a phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware, a VBScript encoded script, downloads a .doc file and opens it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques were used, including multilayered base64 encoding, to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control** communication was established with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the FHAPPI campaign used VBScript to create an object in the shell and executed PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code to infect the victim's system.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves executing PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code, which is a method of execution and evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code to infect the system aligns with the **Execution** tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on the victim's system.
   - Given that the system is already infected (as per the question's premise), the next logical steps would involve tactics that follow initial infection, such as evading detection, establishing command and control, or attempting to gain further access.
   - **Defense Evasion** is mentioned in the report and is a plausible next step after infection, as the attackers would want to maintain access and avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access** could be a subsequent step to gain more privileges or move laterally within the network, but it's not directly implied by the execution of PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code.
   - **Initial Access** has already occurred, as the system is infected, so it's not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes actions that lead to the infection of the victim's system, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
   - After infecting the system, the next logical step for the attackers would be to ensure they can maintain access without being detected, which aligns with **Defense Evasion**.
   - Given the context provided, **Defense Evasion** is the most likely tactic to occur after the system is infected, as it directly follows the execution of malicious code and is aimed at avoiding detection to maintain access.

Final Answer: D
