To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The initial access vector was through spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents.
   - These documents used an undocumented Word feature to evade defenses, specifically leveraging the INCLUDEPICTURE field to follow a URL to the attackers' server without containing macros, exploits, or active content.
   - The report mentions the use of this feature to bypass security measures but does not explicitly state the sequence of tactics after initial access.

2. **Identify the attack sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with OLE2 documents.
   - Defense Evasion: Using an undocumented Word feature.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before attackers employed an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
     1. Initial Access (already occurred).
     2. An action to gather information (the question's focus).
     3. Employing an undocumented Word feature (for defense evasion or potentially for execution).

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Given that the attackers needed to understand the environment (e.g., software installed) to effectively use the undocumented Word feature, reconnaissance would logically precede the employment of such a feature to ensure it would work as intended.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves executing code on the victim's system. While the use of the undocumented Word feature could be part of execution, the question asks what happened before this feature was used, suggesting that execution might not be the immediate predecessor.
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This has already occurred, as the attackers have gained access through spear phishing.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This involves establishing communication between the victim's system and the attackers' server. While important, it doesn't directly relate to gathering information about the software installed before using a specific exploit or feature.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers gained initial access.
   - To effectively use an undocumented feature (especially one that relies on specific software configurations), they would need to gather information about the target system.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering such information, making it a logical precursor to using a targeted exploit or feature like the one described.

**Final Answer: A**
