To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Smooth Operator malware's behavior in terms of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Execution**: Smooth Operator executes as part of the 3CX software and creates a new thread.
     2. **Persistence**: It persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Employs techniques like daemonizing, deleting itself, and obfuscating traffic.
     4. **Discovery**: Collects information from the victim machine.
     5. **Collection**: Stages collect data for beacons or exfiltration.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS with obfuscation.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Automatically exfiltrates collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems.
   - The key here is understanding the sequence of events in a supply chain attack and how malware like Smooth Operator would initially interact with a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - In a supply chain attack, the malware is embedded in software before it reaches the victim, meaning the **Initial Access** (getting into the system) is achieved through the distribution of the trojanized software.
   - Once the software is installed, the malware's first significant action related to the ATT&CK framework would be **Execution**, as it begins to run on the system.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurs after the malware has infiltrated the system, implying we are looking for an action that happens after the initial infection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** (D) is the tactic by which the malware enters the system, in this case, through a supply chain attack with trojanized software.
   - **Execution** (C) is the first tactic mentioned in the report and is the action of the malware running on the system, which directly follows the initial access in the attack sequence.
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic after the malware has infiltrated, **Execution** is the most direct and immediate action following the initial access, as it describes how the malware starts its operations within the system.

**Final Answer: C**
