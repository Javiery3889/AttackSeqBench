To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT15 that started with **Initial Access** to the victim's network, where they compromised over 30 hosts.
   - The attackers used tools like Mimikatz to gain **Privilege Escalation** by obtaining domain administrator credentials.
   - They deployed backdoors, including RoyalDNS, which is notable for its persistence and use of DNS for communication, under **Execution**.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics were used, such as evading policy settings that disable command prompt execution.
   - **Credential Access** was achieved through Mimikatz and stealing a VPN certificate.
   - **Collection** of data was performed using various tools to export data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The RoyalDNS backdoor is described as installing persistently and using DNS for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that RoyalDNS installs persistently, this action itself is a form of **Persistence** (A), as it allows the attackers to maintain access to the victim's network over time.
   - **Resource Development** (B) involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources that can be used to support operations, which doesn't directly follow the deployment of a backdoor in this context.
   - **Privilege Escalation** (C) has already been achieved by APT15 through the use of Mimikatz before the deployment of backdoors.
   - **Exfiltration** (D) involves transferring data from the victim's network, which could be a logical next step after collecting data, but the question specifically asks about the tactic following the deployment of RoyalDNS.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of RoyalDNS, which installs persistently and communicates over DNS, directly supports the **Persistence** tactic, as it ensures continued access to the victim's network.
   - While **Exfiltration** could be a subsequent step after data collection, the question focuses on the immediate implication of deploying a persistent backdoor.
   - Therefore, the most direct and immediate ATT&CK tactic following the deployment of RoyalDNS is **Persistence**, as it directly relates to maintaining access.

Final Answer: A
