To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Desert Falcons' methods for initial access, including spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - Techniques mentioned include social engineering, exploiting trust, and using tricks like the rar/lnk trick and fake plugins to infect victims.
   - The report also mentions that the group conducted mass infections through Facebook posts and redirects to fake pages.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - The report does not explicitly detail the sequence after initial access but mentions the use of various infection vectors and the development of malware for maintaining control.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after gaining initial access, specifically in the context of managing three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over victims.
   - The question implies a need to identify a tactic related to maintaining control or communication with compromised systems.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This involves stealing data from the victim's network. While the report mentions the theft of over one million files, the question's context is about maintaining control, not data theft.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This has already been achieved according to the question's premise and does not relate to maintaining control.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)**: This involves gathering information about the target. While important, the question's focus is on maintaining control over compromised systems, not gathering information before an attack.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems, which aligns with the context of managing campaigns with different C&C/IPs to control victims.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Desert Falcons gained initial access through sophisticated social engineering and phishing tactics.
   - After gaining access, to effectively manage and control the compromised systems, especially in the context of running separate campaigns with different command and control servers/IPs, they would need to establish a reliable means of communication with these systems.
   - The tactic that directly relates to this requirement is Command and Control, as it involves techniques for maintaining communication with compromised systems, which is essential for issuing commands, receiving stolen data, and maintaining control over the victim's network.

**Final Answer: D**
