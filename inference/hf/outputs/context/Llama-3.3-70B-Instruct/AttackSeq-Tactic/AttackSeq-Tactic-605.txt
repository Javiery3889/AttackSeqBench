To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the activities of FIN4, a group targeting individuals with access to confidential information about mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and major market-moving announcements.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned or implied in the report includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN4 targets specific individuals and uses spearphishing emails tailored to their interests and roles.
     2. **Resource Development**: FIN4 organizes targets using campaign codes and transmits these codes along with stolen credentials to their C2 servers.
     3. **Initial Access**: FIN4 gains access through spearphishing emails with VBA macros or fake OWA login pages.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: FIN4 creates rules in Outlook to delete emails that might indicate their presence.
     5. **Credential Access**: FIN4 captures credentials through spearphishing and fake login pages.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials along with campaign codes to their infrastructure.
   - The key detail here is the transmission of stolen credentials and campaign codes to FIN4's servers, which is part of **Resource Development** and **Credential Access**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the transmission of credentials and campaign codes is mentioned, we are looking for a tactic that would logically follow the acquisition and initial handling of these credentials.
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This involves the removal of data from the target system. Given that FIN4's goal is to access confidential information for financial gain, exfiltration of sensitive data would be a logical next step after gaining access and transmitting credentials.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: While FIN4 does establish command and control channels, the transmission of credentials is part of setting up this capability, not a step that follows it.
   - **Credential Access (C)**: This has already occurred, as the question states that credentials have been transmitted.
   - **Reconnaissance (D)**: While ongoing reconnaissance might occur, the specific action of transmitting credentials and campaign codes suggests a step beyond initial reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - FIN4's primary goal is to access confidential information for financial gain.
   - They use spearphishing and other tactics to gain initial access and credentials.
   - The transmission of credentials and campaign codes to their infrastructure is a step in organizing and potentially using the accessed information.
   - The next logical step after gaining access and organizing the credentials would be to **exfiltrate** the sensitive information they were after, such as details on mergers and acquisitions or other market-moving announcements.

Final Answer: A
