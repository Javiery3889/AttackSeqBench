To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving the ATMitch malware.
   - The sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: The malware was manually installed on the victim ATM.
     2. **Execution**: The malware injects its payload into a process using thread hijacking.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware disguises its payload and uses thread hijacking to avoid detection.
     4. **Discovery**: The malware targets a specific process related to banking software.
     5. **Command and Control**: The malware reads commands from a file and logs actions locally.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the malware dispensed cash by interacting with ATM components.
   - The key detail here is the interaction with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library to dispense cash.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the action of dispensing cash, which is an outcome of the malware's operation rather than its initial installation, execution, evasion, discovery, or command and control mechanisms.
   - Dispensing cash directly impacts the system or the environment (in this case, the ATM and its financial resources), which aligns with causing an effect on the target system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access (D)** refers to the initial breach or entry point, which is not relevant to the action of dispensing cash.
   - **Command and Control (A)** involves directing the malware, which the question mentions as reading commands, but this is about controlling the malware, not the direct action of dispensing cash.
   - **Credential Access (C)** is about obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the action described.
   - **Impact (B)** refers to the outcome or effect on the system or environment, such as data manipulation, disruption of service, or financial theft, which aligns with the action of dispensing cash.

Given the above analysis, the action of dispensing cash by interacting with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library would most likely fall under the **Impact** tactic, as it directly affects the system (the ATM) and its resources (cash), causing a tangible outcome of the attack.

**Final Answer: B**
