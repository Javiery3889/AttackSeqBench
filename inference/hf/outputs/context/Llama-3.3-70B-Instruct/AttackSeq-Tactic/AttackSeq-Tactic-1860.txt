To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The attack sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability (implied, as it's the entry point).
     2. **Execution**: Running PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and execute additional files, including the Milestone backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself and creating a service.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Creating a new administrator user.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Using a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide malicious artifacts.
     6. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor discovers system information, files, directories, and captures screens.
     7. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C2 server.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Deep Panda executed PowerShell scripts and batch files (Execution) during their attack chain.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves the execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files, which is identified as the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files is the point of interest, we need to determine what likely happened before this step.
   - **Initial Access** is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold within a network, which would precede the execution of malicious scripts or files.
   - **Persistence**, **Credential Access**, and **Execution** are tactics that typically occur after initial access has been gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack chain begins with exploiting a vulnerability (Log4Shell), which aligns with gaining **Initial Access**.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional malicious modules like Milestone is a step that would logically follow after the attackers have gained access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that **Initial Access** occurred before the **Execution** of PowerShell scripts and batch files.

Final Answer: D
