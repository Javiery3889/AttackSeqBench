To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the setup of Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure by the actor.
   - It mentions the use of lookalike domains for news and military sites to host NetTraveler payloads and facilitate communication with compromised systems.
   - The report specifically highlights the registration of these domains and lists several domain names and IP addresses used for C&C.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence implied in the report starts with the setup of C&C infrastructure, which is a post-exploitation activity.
   - The report does not directly mention the initial exploitation method but focuses on the C&C aspect.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the actor used spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to deliver NetTraveler.
   - The initial access vector mentioned is spear-phishing, which aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The question implies a sequence where the actor has already gained initial access and is looking for the next step in the attack chain.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the actor has already delivered NetTraveler via spear-phishing, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve establishing a channel for command and control to issue commands to the compromised systems.
   - The CTI report details the setup and use of C&C infrastructure, which directly follows the initial access and exploitation phase.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The actor uses spear-phishing to deliver malware (NetTraveler), which corresponds to the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - After gaining access, the next step would be to establish "Command and Control" to manage the compromised systems, which is exactly what the CTI report describes.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after initial access via spear-phishing, the actor would establish Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B**
