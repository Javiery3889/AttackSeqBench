To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by Mustang Panda that starts with **Initial Access** via spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts.
   - After the initial access, the report mentions **Defense Evasion** tactics, such as using the double extension trick and employing PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.
   - The sequence of tactics mentioned in the report is: Initial Access, Defense Evasion, and then Command and Control.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access (spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files) but before leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads for defense evasion.
   - The question essentially asks us to identify a tactic that fits between Initial Access and Defense Evasion in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the attack sequence, after the initial access, the attackers would need to execute their payloads to establish a foothold before they can start evading defenses.
   - **Execution** is the tactic that involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which aligns with the need to run the HTA scripts and other payloads after initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion** (A) is mentioned in the report but is what the attackers do after executing their payloads, not before.
   - **Collection** (B) and **Discovery** (C) are tactics that typically occur after the attacker has established a foothold and is looking to gather information about the system or network, which would be after the execution of payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report outlines an attack sequence starting with Initial Access through spearphishing.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to execute their malicious code (HTA scripts) to establish a foothold.
   - The execution of these scripts leads to the dropping of decoy documents and the running of malicious payloads in the background.
   - Before the attackers can leverage PlugX and Cobalt Strike for defense evasion, they must first execute their initial payloads.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs places **Execution** as the tactic occurring after Initial Access but before Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: D
