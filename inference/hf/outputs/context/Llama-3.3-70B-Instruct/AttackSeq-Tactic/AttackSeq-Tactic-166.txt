To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Lazarus group, specifically its subgroup Bluenoroff, targeting financial organizations in Latin America.
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Execution**: The installation of backdoors (BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) on several machines belonging to financial institutions. This is explicitly mentioned as the backdoors were installed as services capable of executing various malicious functions.
     2. **Command and Control**: After installation, the backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after installing backdoors and before connecting to command and control servers to receive commands, specifically to avoid detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves post-installation actions aimed at evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the backdoors were installed and the next step involves connecting to command and control servers, the question hints at an intermediate step focused on avoiding detection.
   - **Defense Evasion** is a tactic that involves techniques used to evade detection, which fits the context of actions taken after initial compromise (backdoor installation) and before establishing a command and control channel.
   - **Execution** is already identified as the tactic used for installing the backdoors, so it's not the answer we're looking for in this context.
   - **Lateral Movement** involves moving laterally within a network, which is not directly implied in the sequence provided between backdoor installation and connecting to command and control servers.
   - **Collection** involves gathering information, which, while possible, does not directly relate to avoiding detection in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lazarus group installed backdoors on financial institution systems, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
   - Before these backdoors connect to command and control servers, it is logical that the attackers would take steps to avoid detection to maintain access and achieve their objectives without being discovered.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics are commonly used post-compromise to maintain a foothold in the target network without being detected, which fits the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after installing backdoors and before connecting to command and control servers, aimed at avoiding detection, is aligned with **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: A
