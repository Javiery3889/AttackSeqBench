To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the BlackEnergy APT group targeting Ukraine.
   - The attack vector involved a malicious Microsoft Word document that, upon enabling macros, dropped and executed a payload ("vba_macro.exe").
   - This payload dropped a DLL file ("FONTCACHE.DAT") and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.
   - The final payload connected to a C&C server.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence in the Order Presented by the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Initial Access**: The attack started with a malicious Word document.
   - **Execution**: Enabling macros led to the execution of "vba_macro.exe".
   - **Persistence**: The malware ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control**: The final payload connected to a C&C server.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensured the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup after "vba_macro.exe" was executed.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves the execution of "vba_macro.exe" and the mechanism that allows the malware to persist and execute on system startup.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report is that after executing "vba_macro.exe", the malware "ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder."
   - This action directly corresponds to the **Persistence** tactic, as it involves techniques to maintain access to the system across restarts.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the mechanism that allows the BlackEnergy dropper to execute on every system startup.
   - The report specifies that after the execution of "vba_macro.exe", persistence was achieved through a LNK file in the startup folder.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines **Persistence** as techniques that allow an adversary to maintain access to a system over time.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely ensured the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D**
