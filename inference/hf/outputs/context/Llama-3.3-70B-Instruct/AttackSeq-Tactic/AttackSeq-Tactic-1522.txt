To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence by Whitefly, an espionage group, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with a dropper.
     2. **Execution**: The dropper executes a loader (Trojan.Vcrodat) that loads malicious DLLs and establishes C&C communication.
     3. **Persistence**: Deploying tools for ongoing communication and control.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting a Windows vulnerability and using Mimikatz for credential theft.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Using search order hijacking and custom malware.
     6. **Credential Access**: Harvesting credentials with Mimikatz.
     7. **Discovery**: Mapping the network and infecting more computers.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Compromising additional machines with stolen credentials.
     9. **Command and Control**: Configuring C&C domains for communication.
     10. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating large volumes of information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement to expand their control.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves using stolen credentials for lateral movement, which is already identified in the report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After lateral movement, the next logical steps based on the report would involve actions that utilize the newly gained access and control.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)** is the action of using stolen credentials to move across the network, which is what the question states has already happened.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)** could occur at various stages, including after lateral movement, to maintain access without detection.
   - **Collection (D)** is a broader tactic that involves gathering information, which would be a primary goal after gaining access to more systems through lateral movement.
   - **Resource Development (A)** isnâ€™t directly mentioned in the sequence provided and seems less directly related to the immediate actions following lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that lateral movement has occurred, the next steps would logically involve utilizing the expanded access for the group's objectives, such as collecting sensitive information.
   - **Collection (D)** aligns with the objective of exfiltrating large volumes of information, as mentioned in the report, and would be a natural next step after gaining access to more systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after lateral movement, considering the group's objectives and the tactics described, would involve collecting information from the compromised systems.

Final Answer: D
