To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the North Korean state-sponsored hackers associated with the APT Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA group.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Hackers broke into online stores of large US retailers, possibly using spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords.
     2. **Exfiltration**: After the initial access, the attackers developed a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites to funnel stolen assets to dark web markets.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when malicious scripts were injected into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
   - This action happens after gaining initial access and before funneling stolen data to hijacked sites for disguise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The action of injecting malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data is not directly described in the provided CTI report as a separate step but is implied as part of the attack sequence.
   - Given the context, this action would be part of establishing a mechanism to collect sensitive data (in this case, transactional data) after initial access has been gained.
   - **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain or create credentials that can be used to access systems, services, or data. Injecting scripts to intercept transactional data could be seen as a means to obtain sensitive information, which might include credentials or other sensitive data.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This has already occurred according to the question stem, so it's not the correct answer.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems or assets. While injecting scripts could be part of setting up command and control, the primary focus here is on data interception rather than control.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While the question mentions that the action occurs before funneling stolen data to hijacked sites, the act of injecting scripts to intercept data is more about collecting the data than transferring it out, which is the focus of exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when malicious scripts were injected to intercept transactional data, which happens after initial access and before exfiltration.
   - The action described is about collecting sensitive data, which aligns more closely with obtaining access to sensitive information.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this action is **Credential Access**, as it involves obtaining sensitive information (which could include credentials or other sensitive data like transactional information) that can be used for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
