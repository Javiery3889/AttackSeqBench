To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through a malicious email attachment.
     2. **Execution**: Running scripts and batch files to set up the attack environment.
     3. **Persistence**: Modifying the Windows registry and using legitimate applications to maintain access.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using legitimate tools to avoid detection.
     5. **Credential Access**: Collecting credentials from mail clients and browsers.
     6. **Collection**: Recurrently collecting credentials.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Uploading stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the attackers established a mechanism to upload stolen credentials to an external FTP server, after they had persistently collected credentials and prepared them for transmission every hour.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves collecting credentials and then uploading them, which suggests a transition from collecting data to moving it outside the compromised network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the action of uploading stolen credentials to an external FTP server. This action follows the collection of credentials and is a method of moving the collected data out of the target network.
   - **Exfiltration** is the tactic that involves moving data out of the target network, which aligns with uploading stolen credentials to an external server.
   - However, the question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that "most likely occurred" in this context, and the provided answer choices do not directly include "Exfiltration." We need to find the closest match among the given options.
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers or acquiring exploit kits. Uploading credentials to an external FTP server could be seen as part of resource development for future operations, such as using those credentials for further attacks or fraud.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information that can be used for subsequent actions. While collecting credentials is part of the attack, the question specifically asks about uploading them, which is a step beyond mere collection.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. Uploading credentials does not fit well with reconnaissance.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing communication channels for controlling compromised systems. While command and control is crucial for the attack's persistence, the act of uploading credentials to an FTP server is more about data exfiltration than command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of uploading stolen credentials to an external FTP server after persistent collection.
   - The closest ATT&CK tactic related to moving collected data out of the network for potential future use (such as fraud or further attacks) is not directly listed, but we must choose the most appropriate from the given options.
   - Given the context, **A: Resource Development** seems the most plausible as it involves setting up resources (in this case, exfiltrated credentials) that can be used for future operations, even though it's a bit of a stretch since the direct action described (exfiltration) isn't perfectly matched by the options provided.
   - **Final Answer: A**
