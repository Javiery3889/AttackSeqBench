To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's activities across several MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Utilizing back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
     2. **Defense Evasion**: Employing practices to avoid detection, such as wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols.
     3. **Discovery**: Malware is built for espionage with system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
     4. **Collection**: Malware has commands for remote control and can be customized with plugins and modules for espionage-type operations.
     5. **Exfiltration**: Malware communicates externally at select times with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals.
   - The sequence of tactics as described focuses on gaining access, evading detection, discovering the environment, collecting data, and exfiltrating it.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK tactic after Longhorn's malware has used commands for remote control and customized plugins for Collection.
   - It specifically mentions protecting communications with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already been used for Collection (using commands for remote control and customized plugins), the next logical step involves maintaining communication with the Command and Control (C&C) servers securely.
   - The question hints at the use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS for protecting these communications, which is directly related to how the malware communicates back to its C&C servers.
   - **Command and Control (B)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the C&C servers. This would include using custom cryptographic protocols over HTTPS to protect these communications, fitting the description provided in the question.
   - **Lateral Movement (A)** involves moving within a network, which is not directly related to protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)** is about gathering information, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Collection (D)** has already occurred, as the question states it has happened and asks for the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines Longhorn's sophisticated operations, including evasion techniques and customized malware for espionage.
   - The question specifies the use of commands for remote control and customized plugins for Collection, indicating an advanced stage of the attack.
   - Protecting communications with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS is crucial for maintaining control over the compromised system and exfiltrating data without detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after Collection, given the context of protecting communications, is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: B
