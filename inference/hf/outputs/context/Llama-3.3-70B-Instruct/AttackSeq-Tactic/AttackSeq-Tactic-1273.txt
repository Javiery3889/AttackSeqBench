To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by TG1021, detailing various tactics used during the attack. The sequence of tactics mentioned includes:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access (via deserialization attacks on Windows IIS servers)
     3. Execution (of memory-resident malware)
     4. Persistence (using web shells and a custom malware framework)
     5. Privilege Escalation (using custom tools and techniques)
     6. Defense Evasion (interfering with logging, evading EDRs)
     7. Credential Access (modifying login webpages to record credentials)
     8. Discovery (using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance)
     9. Command and Control (establishing backdoor functionality with NodeIISWeb)

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, specifically after using SharpHound during the Discovery phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves the use of SharpHound (part of Discovery) and the establishment of Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the use of SharpHound is mentioned as part of the Discovery phase, and knowing the sequence of events from the CTI report, we need to identify which tactic would logically precede the establishment of Command and Control (which involves deploying an inline hook for backdoor functionality).
   - The Discovery phase, where SharpHound was used, is followed by Command and Control in the sequence of tactics that makes the most sense for the narrative provided. However, the question asks for the tactic before Command and Control, considering the context provided.
   - Looking at the sequence:
     - Discovery (where SharpHound was used) is followed by Command and Control in the report's narrative.
     - However, considering the logical flow of an attack, after discovering the environment (Discovery), the next steps would involve actions that enable further control, which could include moving laterally within the network or establishing a command and control channel. Given the options, the most likely tactic that occurred before establishing Command and Control, and considering the use of SharpHound for mapping targets, would be related to moving within the network or further accessing systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic before Command and Control, knowing that Discovery (with SharpHound) has occurred.
   - Given the options:
     - A: Discovery - This is the phase where SharpHound was used, so it's not before itself.
     - B: Initial Access - This happened much earlier in the attack sequence.
     - C: Lateral Movement - This could logically occur after Discovery, as the attacker would use the information gathered to move within the network, potentially before or as part of establishing a robust Command and Control channel.
     - D: Command and Control - This is what we're looking for the precursor to, so it can't be the answer.
   - Considering the logical flow of an attack and the information provided, Lateral Movement (C) is the most plausible answer. It fits the sequence of actions an attacker would take after discovering the network layout and before or as part of establishing a command and control channel for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: C
