To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the OceanLotus backdoor's attack sequence:
     1. **Initial Access**: Delivered via email attachment, executes when a decoy Word document is opened.
     2. **Execution**: Executes the Trojan, displaying a decoy document.
     3. **Persistence**: Creates a Launch Agent for startup, copies itself, and deletes the original application bundle.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs string encoding, custom binary protocol with encryption for C2 communication.
     5. **Discovery**: Surveys the victim's computer, gathering and sending information to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after the backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends information to a remote server, specifically mentioning the use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves surveying the victim's computer (Discovery) and communicating with a C2 server using encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after Discovery (surveying the victim's computer and sending information), the next logical step involves communicating with the command and control server.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 for communication is a method of maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
   - **Command and Control (C)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server, which aligns with the described behavior of using a custom binary protocol with encryption.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The OceanLotus backdoor's actions after surveying the victim's computer and sending the information back to the server would logically involve maintaining communication with the C2 server.
   - The described use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is indicative of Command and Control tactics, as it enables the backdoor to receive commands and send stolen data or other information back to the attackers.
   - Therefore, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic after Discovery, given the context of communicating with a C2 server using encryption, is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
