To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report discusses a malvertising campaign that utilizes "domain shadowing" to distribute Angler Exploit Kit (Angler EK).
   - The technique involves creating fraudulent subdomains under legitimate domains using stolen credentials.
   - The malicious ad server serves harmless ad code to non-targeted clients but subjects targeted clients to a multi-step attack.
   - The attack involves filtering proxied traffic, decoding a bogus GIF, leveraging information disclosure bugs in Internet Explorer, and abusing an HTTPS open redirect by DoubleClick to land the browser on Angler EK.

2. **Identify the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics**:
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign starts with gaining access to high-profile ad networks to distribute malvertising. This is the initial point of entry into the system or network.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The use of "domain shadowing" and other techniques like filtering and redirection actions to avoid detection can be classified under Defense Evasion.
   - Other tactics like **Execution** (not explicitly mentioned but implied through the exploitation of vulnerabilities and the use of exploit kits) and **Persistence** (implied through the loading of various malware payloads) are also part of the attack sequence but are not directly relevant to the question.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after gaining access to high-profile ad networks (Initial Access) and before using 'domain shadowing' (Defense Evasion) to avoid detection.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (B)** has already occurred as the attackers have gained access to high-profile ad networks.
   - **Defense Evasion (A)** is the tactic that involves the use of 'domain shadowing' and other evasion techniques, which is mentioned as happening after the initial access.
   - **Resource Development (C)** could be considered as it involves the development of capabilities (like the malvertising campaign and the use of domain shadowing) that can be used to support other tactics. However, it's not directly implied as the immediate next step after Initial Access in the context of the question.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)** refers to the movement from one system to another within an internal network, which is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence suggests that after gaining **Initial Access (B)**, the attackers would engage in activities that support their campaign, such as setting up the infrastructure for malvertising. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic before 'domain shadowing' (which is a form of **Defense Evasion**), and the most fitting answer that aligns with the sequence of setting up a campaign and then using evasion techniques would be **Resource Development (C)**, as it involves preparing and developing resources (like the malvertising infrastructure and domain shadowing capability) that are then used for the attack.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Gaining access to ad networks.
2. Determine the purpose of this access: To distribute malvertising.
3. Consider what needs to happen for malvertising to be effective: Setting up the necessary infrastructure and capabilities.
4. Recognize that 'domain shadowing' is a technique used to evade detection: This is a defense evasion tactic.

**Final Answer**: C
