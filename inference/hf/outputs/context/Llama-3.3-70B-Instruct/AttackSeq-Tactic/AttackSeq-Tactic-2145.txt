To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack that starts with **Initial Access** through a backdoor included in version 5.33 of the CCleaner application.
   - The attackers then move to **Execution**, where they use PHP files on their C2 server to control communications with infected systems, including deciding which systems should receive a Stage 2 payload based on certain conditions.
   - In the **Discovery** phase, the attackers gather detailed system profile information from infected systems, including OS version, architecture, administrative rights, hostname, domain name, installed software, and running processes.
   - This information is used to determine which machines to target further.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and specifically which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers managed infected environments by adding or removing domains in the database.
   - The question implies a sequence where system profile information is gathered (part of the Discovery tactic) to decide on further actions, including managing the infected environments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The **Discovery** tactic is directly mentioned in the report as the phase where system profile information is gathered.
   - **Command and Control (C2)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems, which would include managing infected environments by adding or removing domains in the database.
   - **Resource Development** involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources (like domains) that can be used for future operations. This could be related to managing domains but is more about preparing resources.
   - **Reconnaissance** is a broader tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which could be considered part of the Discovery phase in this context but is not as directly related to managing infected systems as Command and Control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before managing infected environments, which implies looking for a tactic that precedes the active management of C2 servers or infected systems.
   - Given that the Discovery tactic involves gathering system information to decide which systems to target further, it logically precedes the active management of infected environments.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after **Initial Access** and **Execution**, the attackers engage in **Discovery** to gather system information.
   - The management of infected environments, including adding or removing domains, would be part of **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B**
