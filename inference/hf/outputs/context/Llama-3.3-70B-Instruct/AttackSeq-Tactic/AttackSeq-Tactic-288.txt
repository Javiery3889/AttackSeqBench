To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by the Vyveva backdoor, which include:
     1. **Execution**: Via a service and using the CreateProcessA API.
     2. **Persistence**: Creating a new service for its loader.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Various techniques including decrypting strings, timestomping, masquerading tasks, modifying the registry, and encrypting strings and components.
     4. **Collection**: Compressing files with zlib, collecting files, notifying C&C about removable media, and collecting files from them.
     5. **Command and Control**: Encrypting C&C traffic, communicating via Tor, and exfiltrating data.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Vyveva backdoor compressed files with zlib and notified the C&C about newly inserted removable media. This involves identifying a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the actions of compressing files and notifying the C&C about removable media, which fall under the **Collection** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The actions of compressing files with zlib and notifying the C&C about removable media are part of the **Collection** tactic.
   - Before these actions can occur, the backdoor must have already established a means to collect data, which implies that some form of **Discovery** or **Execution** must have happened to enable the backdoor to interact with the system and gather information.
   - However, the question specifically asks what happened before the **Collection** actions (compressing files and notifying about removable media), and given that **Collection** itself is the tactic that involves gathering data, we need to consider what would logically precede this in the attack sequence described.
   - **Exfiltration** (A) is the act of transferring data from the victim system, which would occur after collection.
   - **Reconnaissance** (C) and **Discovery** (D) could both potentially occur before collection, as they involve gathering information about the target system. However, **Discovery** is more directly related to the actions of the backdoor once it is inside the system, such as identifying files, processes, and other system details that would be necessary before collecting specific data.
   - **Collection** (B) is the tactic that includes the actions described (compressing files and notifying about removable media), so it cannot be what happens before these actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic before the backdoor performs specific collection actions.
   - Given the sequence of events, **Discovery** (identifying what's on the system, such as files and removable media) would logically precede the **Collection** of specific data (compressing files and collecting from removable media).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after establishing persistence, the backdoor would engage in **Discovery** to identify what data is available for collection.

Final Answer: D
