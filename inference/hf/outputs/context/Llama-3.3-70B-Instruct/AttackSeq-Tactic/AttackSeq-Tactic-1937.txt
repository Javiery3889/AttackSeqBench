To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The campaign targets specific entities and leverages current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - The group uses custom loaders for shared malware and employs anti-analysis techniques.
   - Key tactics mentioned include Resource Development, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.

2. **Identify the attack sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with targeting victims (likely involving Initial Access), followed by Execution of the malware, then Persistence, and so on.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved before executing the Korplug variant, specifically regarding delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events.

4. **Identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question**:
   - Delivering malicious documents as part of the attack.

5. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The tactic of delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events to lure victims aligns with the initial stages of an attack, specifically with how an attacker would gain initial access to a system.
   - This action is a form of phishing, which is a common technique used for Initial Access (TA0001) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

6. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions delivering malicious documents, which is a method used to gain access to a system.
   - This method does not directly relate to Resource Development (which involves creating, obtaining, or modifying tools), Execution (which involves running the malware), or Credential Access (which involves obtaining credentials).
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic involved in this step is Initial Access, as it is the phase where attackers attempt to gain entry into a network or system, often through phishing or other social engineering tactics.

**Final Answer: B**
