To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by Tropic Trooper, starting with **Initial Access** through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - This is followed by **Execution**, where the system configuration file drops a backdoor installer, which then installs various components, including a malicious loader and an encrypted configuration file.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics are used, such as DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
   - Finally, **Command and Control** is established using SSL to connect to the C&C server, with the backdoor decrypting its configuration and using custom SSL libraries.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoor loaded the encrypted configuration file, decrypted it, and used SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers.
   - The key actions here are loading the encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and establishing a connection to the C&C server using SSL.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The action of loading an encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and using SSL to connect to C&C servers is part of **Command and Control**.
   - However, the question asks what happened before this step. Given the sequence of events:
     - **Initial Access** got the attackers into the system.
     - **Execution** involved dropping and installing various malicious components, including the backdoor and its encrypted configuration file.
     - **Defense Evasion** was used to avoid detection, which is concurrent with or follows the execution phase in terms of maintaining access without being detected.
     - **Command and Control** is the phase where the backdoor would use its configuration to connect to the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The backdoor loading its encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and connecting to the C&C server using SSL is a **Command and Control** activity.
   - Before this can happen, the backdoor and its configuration must be installed and executed, which falls under **Execution**.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques, like DLL hijacking, are used to ensure the backdoor can operate without detection, which is crucial for maintaining the connection to the C&C server but is not a prerequisite for the backdoor's initial connection attempt.
   - **Persistence** is not directly mentioned in the context of the question's specific actions but is a broader tactic that could be relevant after the backdoor is installed and before it connects to the C&C server, to ensure continued access.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the sequence of events and the specifics of the question, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to have occurred before the described **Command and Control** actions is **Execution**, as it involves the installation and setup of the backdoor and its configuration, which are necessary prerequisites for the backdoor to load its configuration and connect to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C**
