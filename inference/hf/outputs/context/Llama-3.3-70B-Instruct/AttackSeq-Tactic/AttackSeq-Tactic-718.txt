To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence by the Naikon APT group using the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence can be summarized as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation via a weaponized RTF file or other methods to drop a loader.
     2. **Execution**: The loader establishes persistence, injects itself, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: The loader maintains persistence through the 'Startup' folder, 'Run' registry key, or process injection.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Evasion techniques include limited operation windows for C&C servers, fileless loading, and frequent changes in infrastructure and loader variants.
     5. **Discovery**: The Aria-body backdoor gathers extensive system information.
     6. **Collection**: Capabilities include creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, searching for files, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Aria-body backdoor gathered system information and collected files, screenshots, and metadata, to facilitate communication with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Aria-body backdoor has already performed **Discovery** (gathering system information) and **Collection** (collecting files, screenshots, and metadata), the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve communicating with the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data.
   - **Command and Control (D)** is the tactic that involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the C&C server for the purpose of sending and receiving data, which aligns with the described actions after discovery and collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Naikon APT group's actions, as described, follow a sequence where after gathering information and collecting data, the next step would logically involve communicating with their C&C servers.
   - The **Discovery** tactic has already been executed as the Aria-body backdoor gathered system information.
   - The **Collection** tactic has also been executed as the backdoor collected files, screenshots, and metadata.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)** is not directly relevant to the action of communicating with a C&C server for sending and receiving data.
   - **Command and Control (D)** is the most appropriate tactic as it directly involves the communication necessary for receiving commands and sending stolen data to the C&C server.

Final Answer: D
