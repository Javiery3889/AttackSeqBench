To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the XAgent app, a malware designed to collect various information from iOS devices.
   - **Execution**: The malware runs in the background immediately after installation on iOS 7 devices and can restart itself if terminated.
   - **Discovery**: It collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and more.
   - **Command and Control**: It sends collected information via HTTP and can receive commands, with the ability to upload files via FTP.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence of events as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned or implied in the report includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: The malware needs to gain access to the device first.
     2. **Execution**: The malware is installed and runs in the background.
     3. **Discovery**: It collects various information from the device.
     4. **Command and Control**: It communicates with the C&C server to send and receive data.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the XAgent malware began running in the background immediately upon installation on iOS 7 devices.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves understanding what must happen before the malware can execute and run in the background.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Execution (B)** is the tactic that involves running the malware, which is what's described as happening immediately after installation.
   - **Exfiltration (A)** involves stealing data, which would happen after the malware has collected it, not before it starts running.
   - **Credential Access (D)** might be a part of what the malware does (e.g., collecting text messages or contact lists could imply accessing credentials), but it's not what happens before the malware starts running.
   - **Initial Access (C)** is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold on the system, which must happen before the malware can be installed and run.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - For the malware to run in the background immediately upon installation, it first needs to be installed.
   - Installation implies that the device has been compromised or accessed in some way.
   - Therefore, the most logical ATT&CK tactic that precedes the execution of the malware is gaining **Initial Access** to the device.

**Final Answer: C**
