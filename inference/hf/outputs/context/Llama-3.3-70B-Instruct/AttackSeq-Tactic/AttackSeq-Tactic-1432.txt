To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the StellarParticle campaign associated with COZY BEAR, detailing their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Gained access via SSH, port forwarding for RDP, and VPNs.
     2. **Persistence**: Used credential hopping, accounts with Delegated Administrator rights, and malware (TrailBlazer and GoldMax) for persistence.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Stole browser cookies to bypass MFA, used renamed utilities, and renamed systems to blend in.
     4. **Credential Access**: Stole web session cookies, used compromised service principals, and accessed data from Information Repositories.
     5. **Lateral Movement**: Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
     6. **Collection**: Accessed data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after StellarParticle used tools (AdFind and custom tooling) to gather information from Active Directory and systems, preparing to explore other infrastructure for more access pathways.
   - The key detail here is the use of tools for information gathering and preparation for further access, which aligns with tactics related to discovering and mapping out the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of AdFind and custom tooling for identifying pieces of information from Active Directory and systems suggests a phase of gathering intelligence about the network and its components.
   - This activity is preparatory and aimed at understanding the environment to identify potential vulnerabilities or pathways for further access.
   - Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactics that involve gathering information about the environment and its systems are **Reconnaissance** and **Discovery**.
   - **Reconnaissance** typically involves gathering information about a target prior to accessing it, which might not perfectly fit the scenario since the threat actor is already inside the network.
   - **Discovery** involves gaining knowledge about the internal workings, systems, and components of the target environment after initial access has been achieved, which aligns with the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The StellarParticle campaign's use of AdFind and custom tooling to identify information from Active Directory and systems indicates a phase of environment discovery and mapping.
   - This activity is aimed at facilitating further movement and access within the network.
   - Given the context, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that follows such preparatory information gathering is **Discovery**, as it directly relates to the process of exploring and understanding the internal environment to identify pathways for additional access.
   - **Discovery** is the tactic that involves techniques used to gather information about the environment, systems, and potential vulnerabilities after initial access has been gained.

Final Answer: D
