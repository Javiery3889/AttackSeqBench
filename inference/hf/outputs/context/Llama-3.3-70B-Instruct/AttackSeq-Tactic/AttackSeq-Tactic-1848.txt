To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the BlueDelta campaign's activities in terms of MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration.
   - The sequence of tactics as described is:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Defense Evasion
     5. Credential Access
     6. Discovery
     7. Collection
     8. Exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after BlueDelta collected emails and before it exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves Collection (of emails) and Exfiltration (of session cookie and address book).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the sequence from the report, after Collection (which involves creating a filter to forward emails to an attacker-controlled address), the next logical step before Exfiltration would be a tactic that enables the attackers to communicate with the compromised system or manage the exfiltration process.
   - **Command and Control (B)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control (C2) infrastructure. This would be necessary for the attackers to issue commands, receive stolen data, and potentially control the exfiltration process.
   - **Collection (A)** has already occurred according to the question, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **Resource Development (C)** is not directly related to the sequence of collecting emails and then exfiltrating specific data.
   - **Exfiltration (D)** is the action of removing data from the system, which is mentioned as happening after the tactic we are trying to identify.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after email collection and before exfiltration of specific data.
   - Collection of emails is a precursor to potentially exfiltrating more sensitive data.
   - For exfiltration to occur efficiently, especially in a targeted manner (like exfiltrating a session cookie and address book), the attackers would need to establish a means of controlling or communicating with the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most logical ATT&CK tactic that fits this sequence is Command and Control, as it would enable the attackers to manage the exfiltration process and receive the exfiltrated data.

Final Answer: B
