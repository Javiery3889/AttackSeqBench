To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack campaign by the threat actor Ke3chang using the TidePool malware.
   - **Initial Access**: Achieved through spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.
   - **Execution**: TidePool malware allows various actions like file manipulation and command execution. It gathers victim computer information, encodes it in base64, and sends it to the C2 server via HTTP.
   - **Persistence**: Achieved by utilizing an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry to launch on boot.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Modifies registry settings to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after TidePool achieved persistence and began communicating with its domain to execute remote commands.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves achieving persistence and then communicating with a C2 server for command execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After achieving persistence, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve the malware communicating with its C2 server to receive commands or send stolen data.
   - **Command and Control (C2)** is the tactic that involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server for executing commands or exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines the initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion tactics used by the TidePool malware.
   - After achieving persistence, the malware's next action, as described, involves communicating with its C2 server, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - This tactic is about establishing a channel for command execution, which matches the scenario of the malware communicating with 'goback.strangled[.]net' to execute remote commands.
   - Therefore, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic after achieving persistence is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: C
