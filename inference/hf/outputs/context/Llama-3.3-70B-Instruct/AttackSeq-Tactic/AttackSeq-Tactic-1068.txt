To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes XtremeRAT's capabilities, including remote shell access, file upload/download, registry interaction, process and service manipulation, desktop capture, and device recording.
   - It mentions the malware's ability to include keylogging and USB infection functions.
   - The report also discusses the malware's distribution, usage, and the sectors it has targeted.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence of tactics based on the report includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through spam campaigns and traditional cybercrime.
     2. **Execution**: XtremeRAT allows for remote shell access, file manipulation, and device recording.
     3. **Persistence** and **Privilege Escalation** are not directly mentioned but could be implied through the malware's capabilities.
     4. **Defense Evasion** and **Credential Access** could be related to the keylogging function and the ability to manipulate running processes and services.
     5. **Command and Control (C2)**: Implied through the mention of CnC servers and the sinkhole analysis.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK tactic after utilizing XtremeRAT's capabilities for interaction with the victim.
   - It specifically mentions the use of configuration data like CnC information and FTP credentials for sending stolen keystroke data.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question mentions the use of configuration data for sending stolen keystroke data, this implies the malware is already installed and interacting with the victim's system.
   - The mention of sending stolen keystroke data suggests that **Credential Access** has already occurred (through keylogging).
   - The use of CnC information and FTP credentials for sending data points towards the malware communicating back to its operators.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The capabilities described (remote shell, file manipulation, device recording) align with **Execution** and potentially **Privilege Escalation** and **Defense Evasion**.
   - The question's focus on sending stolen keystroke data using CnC information and FTP credentials suggests a step beyond initial execution and interaction.
   - **Command and Control (B)** is the most relevant tactic when considering the communication of stolen data back to the attackers, as it involves the establishment of a channel for command and control between the compromised system and the attacker's CnC server.
   - **Credential Access (A)** is relevant due to the mention of keystroke data, but the question seems to ask about the next step after such data is collected, which would be its transmission.
   - **Resource Development (C)** and **Execution (D)** are less directly related to the transmission of stolen data using CnC channels.

**Final Answer: B**
