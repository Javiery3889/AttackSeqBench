To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: Execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files.
     3. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself and creating a service.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Creation of a new administrator user and execution of the backdoor with elevated privileges.
     5. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communication with a C2 server.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Deep Panda employed the Fire Chili rootkit to hide malicious artifacts.
   - The Fire Chili rootkit is used for **Defense Evasion**, as it hides malicious artifacts, files, processes, and network connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Fire Chili rootkit is used for **Defense Evasion**, we need to consider what tactics would logically precede this action.
   - **Defense Evasion** is used to avoid detection, which would be necessary after the initial stages of the attack have been set up, such as gaining access, executing malicious code, and establishing persistence.
   - **Discovery** (D) is a tactic that involves gathering information about the system and network, which could be done after initial access and before attempting to evade defenses to maintain stealth.
   - **Lateral Movement** (B) involves moving laterally within a network, which might not necessarily precede defense evasion in all cases.
   - **Resource Development** (C) is about developing resources like malware or infrastructure, which happens before the attack.
   - **Defense Evasion** (A) itself is the tactic that involves evading detection, which is what the Fire Chili rootkit is used for, so it's not what we're looking for as a preceding tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before employing the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion.
   - Given the context, after initial access and execution, the attackers would likely want to understand the environment before hiding their tracks.
   - **Discovery** (D) fits as a logical step before **Defense Evasion** because understanding the system and network would help in evading defenses more effectively.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence considering the use of the Fire Chili rootkit for hiding would involve **Discovery** before **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: D
