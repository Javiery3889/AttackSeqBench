To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign named RevengeHotels targeting the hospitality sector.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
     2. **Execution**: Malware execution, including the use of RATs like RevengeRAT, and a module called ScreenBooking for capturing credit card data.
     3. **Credential Access**: Capturing credit card data and selling credentials for remote access to compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic likely to occur after capturing credentials and enabling remote access, specifically to gather credit card data by monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves post-compromise activities focused on data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the use of malware to capture credit card data, including monitoring web pages (e.g., booking.com) and the capability to collect data from the clipboard and printer spooler.
   - The question specifically mentions monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data, which aligns with the capabilities of the malware described in the report, such as the ProCC campaigns' customized backdoor.
   - The ATT&CK tactics provided as answer choices are:
     - **A: Discovery**: Involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or organization.
     - **B: Persistence**: Involves maintaining access to the system.
     - **C: Collection**: Involves gathering information relevant to the adversary's goals.
     - **D: Credential Access**: Already mentioned in the report as a goal (capturing credentials), but the question asks for the next step after this has been achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that the attackers have already gained access and are looking to gather specific data (credit card information) by monitoring the clipboard and printer spooler, the most relevant tactic is **Collection**.
   - **Collection** is the tactic that best fits the action of gathering credit card data through monitoring specific system activities (clipboard and printer spooler), which is a direct goal of the attackers as described in the report.
   - **Discovery** might be a part of understanding the system, but it's not directly related to the action of gathering credit card data.
   - **Persistence** is about maintaining access, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Credential Access** has already been achieved according to the question's premise, so it's not the next step.

Final Answer: C
