To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Involves phishing and possibly watering hole attacks.
     2. **Execution**: Utilizes a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant.
     3. **Persistence**: Korplug establishes persistence through scheduled tasks or registry entries.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
     5. **Discovery**: Korplug collects system information.
     6. **Collection**: Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after Korplug collects system information and data, as it communicates with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves data collection followed by communication with servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Korplug has already collected extensive system information and data, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve sending this collected data back to the attackers.
   - The use of encrypted TCP-based protocols for communication with fallback servers suggests a method for command and control (C2) or exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. While C2 communication is crucial, the question specifically mentions the collection of data and communication for potentially sending this data back.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This is the first stage of an attack and does not fit the scenario of communicating collected data back to the attackers.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This involves moving from one system to another within a network, which is not directly implied by the communication with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. Given that Korplug has collected data and the question mentions communication with servers, this is the most likely next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where data has been collected, and communication with servers is necessary.
   - The most logical next step after data collection, considering the need for encrypted communication with servers, is to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurs next is **Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: D
