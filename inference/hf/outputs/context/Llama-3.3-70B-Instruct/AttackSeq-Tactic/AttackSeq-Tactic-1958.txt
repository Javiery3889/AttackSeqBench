To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes ZoxPNG, a RAT that uses the PNG image file format for data transmission with its C2 server.
   - It supports executing arbitrary code from the C2 server and requires the C2 server address as a command line argument.
   - Upon activation, it registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.
   - ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication, allowing it to use proxy settings on the victim's machine.
   - It sends a VictimSystemData structure in the HTTP Cookie header, including a checksum of the victim's computer name.
   - The communication pattern includes HTTP GET and POST requests with a PNG file containing instructions or data.

2. **Identify the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics**:
   - **Execution**: ZoxPNG executes on the victim's machine, requiring the C2 server address.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Uses WinInet API for HTTP communication and sends checksum-validated VictimSystemData.
   - The report then describes the communication pattern, which implies **Command and Control (C2)** activities.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when ZoxPNG established contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests, after using the WinInet API and sending checksum-validated VictimSystemData.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of the WinInet API and the sending of checksum-validated VictimSystemData, both of which are described under **Defense Evasion** in the report.
   - However, the question then asks about the tactic involved when ZoxPNG establishes contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests. This action of establishing contact and potentially receiving commands or instructions aligns with **Command and Control**.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of the WinInet API and sending VictimSystemData are evasion techniques.
   - Establishing contact with the C2 server and the context of sending and potentially receiving data (via HTTP GET requests) is about maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
   - **Defense Evasion** (A) is what ZoxPNG does to avoid detection, which is mentioned but not the focus of the question after the initial contact.
   - **Lateral Movement** (B) is not indicated in the provided sequence; it involves moving within a network, which is not the focus here.
   - **Collection** (D) could be a part of the activities but is not the primary tactic when establishing initial contact with the C2 server for command and control purposes.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of establishing contact with the C2 server via HTTP GET requests after evasion techniques, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: C
