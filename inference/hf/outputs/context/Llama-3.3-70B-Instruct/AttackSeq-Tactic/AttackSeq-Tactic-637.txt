To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes GreyEnergy's malware framework and its modular functionality for espionage and reconnaissance.
   - Initial access methods include spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.
   - The attackers use various techniques for persistence, defense evasion, credential access, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - The "Others" section provides context about GreyEnergy's links to other threat actors and its focus on stealth.

2. **Identify the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics**:
   - **Resource Development**: GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular.
   - **Initial Access**: Through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers.
   - **Persistence**: Securely wiping malware components.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Stealth techniques including partial encryption and fileless execution.
   - **Credential Access**: Using tools like Mimikatz and custom port scanners.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Deploying internal C&C proxies.
   - **Command and Control**: Redirecting requests to external C&C servers via internal proxies.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers before achieving initial access.
   - The question essentially asks about the preparatory phase that led to the targeting of specific systems.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker. It doesn't directly relate to the initial targeting strategy.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This involves the creation and acquisition of resources, such as malware, needed for the operation. While it's about preparation, it's more focused on the development of tools rather than the selection of targets.
   - **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. However, it's broader and not specifically about the initial phase of targeting.
   - **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment, which would inform the strategic targeting of specific systems like ICS control workstations.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that the question asks about the tactic that informed the strategic targeting before initial access, we're looking for the tactic that involves gathering information about potential targets.
   - **Reconnaissance (D)** is the tactic that best fits this description because it involves gathering information about the target environment, which would be necessary for strategically targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with identifying and gathering information about the targets, which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.

Final Answer: D
