To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the Turla group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), focusing on their use of PowerShell to evade detection.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Execution**: Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
     2. **Persistence**: They employ methods like WMI event subscriptions and altering the PowerShell profile to maintain access.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Turla's scripts evade detection through encryption, obfuscation, and an AMSI bypass technique.
     4. **Collection**: Their backdoors can collect files from the local file system and USB drives.
     5. **Command and Control**: They use RPC and Microsoft OneDrive for command and control communications.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Information is exfiltrated through the command and control channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the operators used backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives.
   - The key detail here is the use of backdoors for gathering information, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic, but we're looking for what happened before this.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question mentions the use of backdoors for gathering information (which falls under **Collection**), we need to determine what likely preceded this action.
   - **Collection** involves gathering information, which would logically follow after the attackers have established a means to interact with the system, such as through **Persistence** mechanisms.
   - **Persistence** mechanisms ensure that the attackers can maintain access to the system, which would be necessary before they could use backdoors for collection activities.
   - **Defense Evasion** is mentioned as a tactic used to bypass antimalware scanning, which would be used throughout their operation, including before and during collection activities, to remain undetected.
   - **Discovery** (B) involves the attacker learning about the system and network, which would logically precede the use of backdoors for collection, as it would help them understand what to target.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the scenario after AMSI patching (Defense Evasion), focusing on what happened before using backdoors for collection.
   - For the attackers to effectively use backdoors for collection, they would first need to understand the environment, which involves **Discovery**.
   - **Discovery** would provide the necessary information about the system and network to effectively use backdoors for gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after evading detection, the next logical step before using backdoors for collection would be to perform **Discovery** to understand the environment and identify potential targets.

Final Answer: B
