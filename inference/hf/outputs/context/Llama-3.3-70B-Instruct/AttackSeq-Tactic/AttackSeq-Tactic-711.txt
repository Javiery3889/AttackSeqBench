To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions the detection of various malicious software (Trojan.JS.Nodster.A, Trojan.JS.WINDIVERT.B, and Trojan.Win32.Novter.A) through the use of JavaScript and Windows executable files.
   - The execution of these files (e.g., 05sall.js, bav01.js, module.avi.exe, and Player1558973917.hta) leads to the download and installation of malware on the victim's system.
   - The report provides Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and mentions related URLs and domains used to host malicious content or serve as part of the malware's infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with the **Execution** of malicious files, which leads to the installation of malware.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after executing JavaScript and Windows executable files to install malware.
   - The question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and asks for the next likely tactic after the initial execution.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Execution** (C) is the tactic that has already occurred, as per the question stem, so it's not the next step.
   - **Lateral Movement** (A) involves moving laterally within a network, which might not be the immediate next step after installing malware on a single system.
   - **Discovery** (B) involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system or network, which could be a next step but isn't directly implied by the installation of malware.
   - **Command and Control** (D) is the tactic that involves establishing a channel for controlling the malware, which is a logical next step after the malware is installed on the victim's system. This would allow the attackers to issue commands to the malware.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The execution of malicious files leads to the installation of malware.
   - After the malware is installed, the attackers would need a way to control it.
   - Establishing **Command and Control** is essential for the attackers to utilize the installed malware effectively.

**Final Answer: D**
