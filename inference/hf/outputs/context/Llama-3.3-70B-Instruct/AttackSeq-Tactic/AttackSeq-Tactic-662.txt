To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Execution** (malicious Office document with macros).
   - The document contains base64 blobs that are decoded and executed based on the system architecture.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used, including the reuse of a VBS decode function and the use of a KerrDown DLL to retrieve and execute a payload in memory.
   - **Command and Control** is established through the KerrDown DLL, which downloads and executes a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - The **Others** section provides context about the threat actor, OceanLotus, and their operational patterns.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after OceanLotus delivered KerrDown to targets.
   - The delivery methods mentioned are malicious Office documents with macros and RAR archives containing DLL side-loading.
   - The answer choices are tactics from the MITRE ATT&CK framework: Execution, Initial Access, Resource Development, and Privilege Escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The delivery of KerrDown via malicious Office documents with macros and RAR archives containing DLL side-loading corresponds to the **Initial Access** tactic, as it describes how the attacker gains initial access to the system.
   - After gaining initial access, the next steps involve executing the malicious payload, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic described in the report.
   - **Resource Development** refers to the introduction or discovery of new tools or techniques by the adversary, which is not directly related to the sequence of delivering KerrDown and executing its payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation** involves techniques used to gain higher-level permissions on a system, which, while possible in the attack sequence, is not directly implied as the immediate next step after delivering KerrDown.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the delivery of KerrDown.
   - The delivery itself is an instance of **Initial Access**.
   - The immediate next step in the attack sequence, as described, involves the execution of the malicious payload, which corresponds to the **Execution** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining **Initial Access** through the delivery of KerrDown, the next tactic would be **Execution**, as this is when the malicious payload (in this case, KerrDown and subsequently the Cobalt Strike Beacon) is executed on the victim's system.

Final Answer: A
