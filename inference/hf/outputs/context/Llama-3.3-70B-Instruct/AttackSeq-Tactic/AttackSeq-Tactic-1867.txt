To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: Execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including the installation of a malicious DLL (Milestone backdoor).
     3. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself and creating a service.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Creation of a new administrator user and execution of the backdoor with elevated privileges.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Use of a novel kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide malicious artifacts.
     6. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor discovers system information, files, directories, and captures screens.
     7. **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicates with a C2 server, sending information about current sessions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Milestone backdoor established communication with its C2 server by sending information about current sessions on the system.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves the backdoor's communication with the C2 server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the backdoor has already established communication with the C2 server and sent information about current sessions, the next logical steps would involve using the information gathered for further malicious activities.
   - **Command and Control (A)** is the tactic that involves the communication with the C2 server, which has already occurred according to the question.
   - **Discovery (B)** could be an ongoing process but is less likely to be the immediate next step after establishing C2 communication, as the question implies a progression beyond the initial discovery and C2 establishment.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)** is a plausible next step after the attacker has gained access, established a foothold, and gathered information about the system and its sessions. This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to expand access and control.
   - **Exfiltration (D)** could also be a next step but typically would follow after the attacker has identified valuable data to exfiltrate, which might not directly follow the establishment of C2 communication without additional context on data discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur after the backdoor has established communication with its C2 server and sent session information.
   - Given the context, the attacker has already gained access, executed malware, persisted, escalated privileges, evaded defenses, discovered system information, and established command and control.
   - The next logical step, considering the attacker now has a solid foothold and is communicating with the C2 server, would be to **move laterally within the network** to expand access, gather more information, or prepare for further malicious activities like exfiltration or impact.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after establishing C2 communication would involve **Lateral Movement** to further compromise the network.

Final Answer: C
