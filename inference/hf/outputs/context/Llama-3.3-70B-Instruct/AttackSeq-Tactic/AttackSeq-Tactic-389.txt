To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that involves several MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence of events based on the tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Resource Development**: Threat actors acquired domain names and rented servers.
     2. **Initial Access**: Compromised websites were used to inject JavaScript code, and spearphishing campaigns were conducted with malicious Word documents.
     3. **Execution**: Malicious Word documents executed code using VBA macros.
   - The report also mentions the use of compromised websites to load additional malicious code from the threat actors' command and control (C&C) servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents, specifically when scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers.
   - The key detail here is the communication with external servers after the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The execution of VBA macros is mentioned in the report as part of the **Execution** tactic.
   - The communication with external servers (in this context, the C&C servers) after the execution of malicious code is indicative of the threat actors maintaining control over the compromised systems and receiving or sending data.
   - Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, **Command and Control (C2)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between compromised systems and the threat actors' C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the communication with external servers after the execution of malicious code, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - **Execution** (A) is the tactic where the malicious code is run, which has already occurred according to the question.
   - **Impact** (B) refers to the effects of the attack on the system or data, which is not directly related to the communication with external servers.
   - **Initial Access** (D) is how the threat actors first gain access to the system, which has also already occurred.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the tactic that involves communication with C&C servers after the initial execution of malicious code.

Final Answer: C
