To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a malware campaign targeting the Italian automotive sector.
   - **Initial Access** is achieved through a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in.
   - **Execution** involves the use of a VBA macro to download and execute a dropper, which leads to the execution of the RevengeRAT payload.
   - **Persistence** is established by creating a scheduled task to run the 'mshta.exe' utility, ensuring continuous execution of the malicious code.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after establishing persistence, specifically for establishing communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.
   - The tactics mentioned in the answer choices are Privilege Escalation, Persistence, Command and Control, and Lateral Movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Persistence** has already been established according to the report, through the creation of a scheduled task. Thus, option B (Persistence) is what has already been achieved and not what comes next.
   - **Privilege Escalation** (option A) could be a part of the attack but is not directly related to establishing communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.
   - **Lateral Movement** (option D) involves moving laterally within a network, which is not directly implied by the need to establish communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.
   - **Command and Control** (option C) is the tactic that involves establishing communication with remote servers for issuing commands and exfiltrating data, which aligns with the likely next steps after establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report outlines how the attackers gain initial access and establish persistence.
   - The question specifically asks about the next logical step after persistence has been established, focusing on communication with remote servers.
   - Given the context, the most plausible next step after establishing persistence would be to set up a means for command and control, allowing the attackers to issue commands and exfiltrate data.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after establishing persistence for the purpose of establishing communication with remote servers is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
