To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the threat actor Tortoiseshell.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Creation of a fake website to trick users into downloading a malware downloader.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gaining access through the downloaded malware.
     3. **Execution**: Executing the downloaded binaries, including a reconnaissance tool named 'bird.exe' and a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT).
     4. **Persistence**: Installing and executing the RAT as a service.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Employing techniques to evade detection, such as checking Google reachability and using a modular design.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during the use of the tool 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves the use of 'bird.exe' after defense evasion techniques have been employed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The tool 'bird.exe' is mentioned in the **Reconnaissance** and **Execution** phases of the attack, where it is used to collect extensive information from the victim's machine.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of 'bird.exe' after defense evasion techniques, which places its primary function in the context of gathering information.
   - The ATT&CK tactic that aligns with gathering detailed information about the victim's system is **Discovery**. Discovery involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization. The use of 'bird.exe' to collect system information fits within this tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines the attack sequence, starting with reconnaissance and initial access, followed by execution, where 'bird.exe' is used.
   - 'bird.exe' is used for collecting system information, which is a key aspect of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - Although defense evasion techniques are mentioned, the question specifically asks about the tactic related to the use of 'bird.exe', not the evasion techniques themselves.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic related to the use of 'bird.exe' for gathering system information is **Discovery**.

Final Answer: C
