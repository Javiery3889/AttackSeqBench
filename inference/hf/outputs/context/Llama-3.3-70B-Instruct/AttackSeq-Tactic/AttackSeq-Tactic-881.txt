To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** using Cobalt Strike's beacon.
   - After establishing a foothold, attackers move to **Privilege Escalation** to gain higher privileges.
   - The report then mentions **Defense Evasion** techniques used by Cobalt Strike to avoid detection.
   - Following privilege escalation, the attackers engage in **Discovery** activities using tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather network information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after the **Discovery** phase, specifically when attackers propagate beacons to other systems within the company's network.
   - The question implies a movement or spread of the attack within the network after the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already completed the initial access, escalated privileges, evaded defenses, and discovered the network layout, the next logical step would involve moving laterally within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement** (D) is the tactic that involves moving from one system to another within the network, often to gain access to more sensitive data or systems.
   - **Discovery** (A) has already been accomplished according to the question stem, so it's not the next step.
   - **Execution** (B) refers to the process of executing malicious code on a compromised system, which could be part of the lateral movement but doesn't specifically describe the act of moving between systems.
   - **Defense Evasion** (C) is a technique used throughout the attack to avoid detection but is not a phase that describes the propagation of beacons to other systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have gained access, escalated privileges, evaded detection, and discovered the network.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the context of propagating beacons to other systems, is to move laterally within the network.
   - Lateral movement is essential for spreading the attack, gaining access to more systems, and potentially reaching the ultimate goal, such as deploying ransomware or stealing sensitive data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next ATT&CK tactic after discovery, when considering the propagation of beacons, is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: D
