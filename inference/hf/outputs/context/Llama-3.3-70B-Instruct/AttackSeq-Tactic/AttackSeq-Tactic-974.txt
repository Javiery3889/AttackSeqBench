To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through social engineering and document-based exploits.
     2. **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's to install itself.
     3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
     4. **Credential Access**: It steals various credentials and sensitive information.
     5. **Discovery**: Searches for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
     6. **Collection**: Collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after CosmicDuke collects information, to enable communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and to exfiltrate data via FTP and WebDav servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves data collection followed by communication with remote servers for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after collecting information, CosmicDuke uploads it to remote servers via FTP, which is part of the **Exfiltration** tactic.
   - However, the question specifically asks about enabling communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltrating data via FTP and WebDav servers, which implies a need for establishing command and control (C2) channels.
   - **Command and Control (C2)** is the tactic that involves establishing communication between the malware and the attacker's remote servers. This would be necessary for exfiltrating data via FTP and potentially using HTTP GET requests for communication or additional data exfiltration methods like WebDav.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after data collection to communicate with remote servers and exfiltrate data.
   - The **Exfiltration** tactic is directly related to the action of uploading data to remote servers, but the question hints at the mechanism (enabling communication via HTTP GET requests) that precedes or accompanies exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control** is the tactic that best fits the description of enabling communication with remote servers, which is necessary for both receiving commands and exfiltrating data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after collection, given the context of the question, involves establishing **Command and Control** to facilitate the described exfiltration methods.

Final Answer: A
