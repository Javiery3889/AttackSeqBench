To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the activities of FIN13, a threat actor targeting Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - The tactics used by FIN13, in order, are:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks, capturing credentials.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution.
     4. **Persistence**: Using methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and deploying malware.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizing techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employing tactics like using passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for evasion.
     7. **Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials through process memory dumping and network sniffing.
     8. **Discovery**: Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     9. **Collection**: Collecting data from network shared drives.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using proxies and protocols for command and control.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations, after employing techniques for internal reconnaissance and gathering information on network configurations and services.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves internal reconnaissance, gathering information, and then using WMI and custom web shells.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions activities that align with the **Discovery** tactic, as it involves internal reconnaissance and gathering information on network configurations and services.
   - The use of WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations suggests a step that would logically follow the gathering of information about the network and its services, which is part of the **Discovery** phase.
   - **Initial Access** (D) is the entry point into the network, which would occur before any internal reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development** (A) is not directly mentioned in the sequence of tactics used by FIN13 in the provided report.
   - **Lateral Movement** (C) involves moving within the network, which could be a subsequent step after discovery but is not the immediate predecessor to using tools for cross-platform operations in the context provided.
   - **Discovery** (B) is the tactic that involves gathering information about the network and its services, which would logically precede the use of specific tools for cross-platform operations like WMI and custom web shells.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used specific tools for cross-platform operations.
   - Given the sequence of events and the description of FIN13's activities, the tactic that involves internal reconnaissance and gathering information is **Discovery**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report would place **Discovery** as the tactic before the use of WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations.

Final Answer: B
