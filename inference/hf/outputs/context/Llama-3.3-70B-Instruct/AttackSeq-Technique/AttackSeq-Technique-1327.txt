To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through social engineering and document-based exploits.
     2. **Execution**: Utilizing a loader similar to MiniDuke's.
     3. **Persistence**: Creating scheduled tasks and installing a Windows service.
     4. **Credential Access**: Stealing credentials from various software and Windows.
     5. **Discovery**: Searching for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with remote servers via HTTP, FTP, and WebDav.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Uploading collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types, after utilizing Discovery techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the action of gathering information from removable drives, which aligns with the **Discovery** phase but specifically mentions removable media.
   - The report details CosmicDuke's ability to search for files on hard drives and network drives but does not explicitly mention removable drives. However, the action of searching for specific files and the context of discovery imply that the malware could be capable of accessing data from various sources, including removable media.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1025-Data from Removable Media** directly relates to collecting data from removable media, which fits the scenario described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the action of gathering information from removable drives after the Discovery phase.
   - The report details CosmicDuke's capabilities in the Discovery phase, which includes searching for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for collecting data from removable media is **T1025-Data from Removable Media**.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with the scenario described is **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**.

Final Answer: D
