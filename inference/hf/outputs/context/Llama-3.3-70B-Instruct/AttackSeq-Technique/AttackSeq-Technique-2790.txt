To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses an iOS malware found in Operation Pawn Storm, which is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The malware is capable of collecting various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.
   - It communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server via HTTP, using POST requests to send collected data and GET requests to receive commands.
   - The malware also has the capability to upload files via FTP.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on compromised systems.
   - **Discovery**: The malware collects information from the iOS device.
   - **Command and Control**: The malware sends collected information to the C&C server and receives commands.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the app began collecting information.
   - The answer choices involve different techniques: Data Encoding, Thread Local Storage, User Execution, and Systemd Timers.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1132-Data Encoding** is related to encoding data to avoid detection, which could be relevant after the data is collected or during communication but doesn't directly relate to the initial execution or installation of the malware.
   - **T1055.005-Thread Local Storage** is a technique used for persistence, which might be relevant but doesn't directly explain how the malware started collecting information.
   - **T1204-User Execution** involves executing malicious code in the context of a user, which could be relevant as the malware runs in the background after installation.
   - **T1053.006-Systemd Timers** is a technique for achieving persistence by scheduling a task, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate action of starting to collect information after installation.

Given the context that the malware is installed, runs in the background, and then starts collecting information, the most plausible technique that occurred before it began collecting information is related to how it was executed or started running on the system.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware is installed on the system, indicating an initial access tactic.
2. For the malware to start collecting information, it needs to be executed.
3. The question asks for the technique that occurred before the collection of information started, which implies we are looking for how the malware was executed or started.

**Final Answer**: C: T1204-User Execution
