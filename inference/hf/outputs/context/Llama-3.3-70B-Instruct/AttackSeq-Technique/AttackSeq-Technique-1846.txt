To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report discusses a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) known as TAIDOOR, used by Chinese government cyber actors.
   - The malware is installed as a service DLL and consists of two files: a loader and an encrypted second file which is the main RAT.
   - The loader decrypts and runs the RAT in memory.
   - After execution, the RAT attempts to connect to command-and-control (C2) servers.

2. **Identify the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics**:
   - The sequence relevant to the question involves the execution of the RAT in memory and its attempt to establish communication with C2 servers.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to establish communication with C2 servers after the TAIDOOR RAT decrypts and executes the main malware in memory.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves establishing C2 communication.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report is that after the RAT is executed in memory, it attempts to connect to C2 servers.
   - We need to find the ATT&CK technique that best matches this action of establishing communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: Involves using a dead drop resolver to establish communication, which doesn't directly match the general action of connecting to C2 servers as described.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Refers to using non-standard ports for communication, which could be a method used to connect to C2 servers but isn't explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - **T1053.003-Cron**: Involves scheduling tasks, which doesn't directly relate to establishing real-time communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1204-User Execution**: Involves executing a malicious file or command by a user, which doesn't directly apply to the action of a malware establishing C2 communication.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The report specifies that after the RAT is decrypted and executed, it attempts to connect to C2 servers. This action implies the use of network communication techniques to establish command and control.
   - Among the provided options, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** is the most relevant to the action of establishing communication with C2 servers, as it involves using non-standard ports, which is a common technique for malware to communicate with its C2 servers without being easily detected.
   - Although the report does not explicitly mention the use of non-standard ports, this technique is a plausible method for the TAIDOOR RAT to communicate with its C2 servers, given the context of the attack.

**Final Answer: B**
