To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Suckfly, starting with **Initial Access** through exploiting a vulnerability in the operating system, allowing the installation of the Nidiran back door.
   - **Execution** involves using the back door and hacktools to infect internal hosts, with tools signed by stolen digital certificates.
   - **Privilege Escalation** is achieved by using a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used to make malware analysis difficult.
   - **Credential Access** is gained through a signed credential-dumping tool.
   - **Discovery** involves scanning the internal network for specific open ports.
   - **Command and Control** is established through the Nidiran back door communicating with C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration** involves using the back door to steal data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after scanning the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold and move laterally within the network.
   - The relevant techniques from the question are:
     - A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking
     - B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
     - C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting
     - D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After scanning for open ports (part of the **Discovery** phase), the next logical step in moving laterally within the network would involve exploiting those found vulnerabilities or using the gained access for further intrusion.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** fits well as it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a service that is listening on an open port, which aligns with the scenario of scanning for and then exploiting open ports to move laterally.
   - **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking** involves taking control of an existing session, which might not directly follow the port scanning activity.
   - **T1558.003-Kerberoasting** is a technique for obtaining hashed credentials, which, while relevant to credential access, doesn't directly relate to the action of moving laterally after port scanning.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is more about exploiting applications exposed to the internet, which doesn't directly align with the internal network scanning and lateral movement described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sequence of attacks starting from initial access to exfiltration, with a specific mention of scanning the internal network for open ports as part of the discovery phase.
   - The question focuses on the action taken after this scanning to move laterally within the network.
   - Given the context, exploiting remote services (T1210) is the most logical next step after discovering open ports, as it directly leverages the information gained from the network scan to further compromise the network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after scanning for open ports to expand the foothold and move laterally within the network is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

Final Answer: B
