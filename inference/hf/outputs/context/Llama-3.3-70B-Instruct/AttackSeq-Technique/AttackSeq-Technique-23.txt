To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the "Machete" malware, which is distributed through social engineering tactics including spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website.
   - The malware achieves initial access by being embedded in PowerPoint presentations disguised as Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archives.
   - For persistence, "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installs the malware in a specific directory. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - The report mentions that the malware is used for spying and has infrastructure for various platforms, indicating its capability for data collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after achieving persistence to capture sensitive information from the clipboard.
   - The techniques provided as answer choices are related to different methods of data collection or manipulation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1566-Phishing (A)**: This technique involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information. While phishing is used for initial access, it's not directly related to capturing clipboard data after persistence.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing (B)**: This involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. While it could be used for various malicious activities, it's not specifically about capturing clipboard data.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule (C)**: This technique is about setting up rules to forward emails to an attacker-controlled account, which is not directly related to capturing clipboard data.
   - **T1115-Clipboard Data (D)**: This technique specifically involves capturing data from the clipboard, which can include sensitive information such as passwords, encryption keys, or other data that a user copies.

Given the context of the "Machete" malware's purpose as a spy tool and its ability to achieve persistence on a victim's system, the most logical next step for capturing sensitive information would be to monitor and capture data that the user interacts with, such as clipboard data.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware gains persistence through creating a link and a task, indicating it wants to remain on the system for further data collection.
2. The question specifically asks about capturing sensitive information from the clipboard after achieving persistence.
3. Among the provided options, only one directly relates to the action of capturing clipboard data.

**Final Answer**: D
