To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses a cyber attack where the initial exploitation occurred through a compromised website, leveraging a zero-day vulnerability to deliver malware.
   - The malware used was a variant known as Sakula, which connected to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
   - The attack seemed to target the French aerospace and defense sectors, with indicators suggesting a focus on these areas, such as the use of domains related to aerospace companies and the inclusion of specific domains in the malware's configuration that belong to these companies.

2. **Identifying the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Initial Access**: The attack began with the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability through a compromised website (similar to the Veteran of Foreign Wars website mentioned in the question), leading to the delivery of malware.
   - **Execution**: The malware (Sakula variant) was executed on the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control**: The malware connected to its C2 infrastructure.

3. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users during an initial access campaign.
   - The techniques provided as answer choices are:
     - A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
     - B: T1199-Trusted Relationship
     - C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
     - D: T1608.001-Upload Malware

4. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While relevant to the attack, it's not directly related to the initial exploitation phase.
   - **T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship between the victim and a third party. The report does mention the compromise of Safran's DNS, suggesting a potential trusted relationship exploitation, but this is more about the attacker's method to gain initial access rather than a post-exploitation technique.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web browser when they visit a compromised website. Given the context of the initial access campaign using a zero-day vulnerability through a compromised website, this technique aligns closely with the initial phase of the attack described.
   - **T1608.001-Upload Malware**: This sub-technique involves uploading malware to a compromised system. While uploading malware is part of the attack sequence, the question asks for the technique that occurred after the initial access campaign, which was facilitated by a zero-day vulnerability.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after the initial access campaign, which involved exploiting a zero-day vulnerability.
   - Given the context, **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** is the technique that directly corresponds to the initial exploitation method described, where users were compromised through a website.
   - However, considering the question's phrasing about what happened "after" the initial access, we should focus on the actions taken post-exploitation. Among the provided options, **T1608.001-Upload Malware** seems to be a direct consequence of a successful initial access, where the attackers would upload malware to the compromised system as part of establishing a foothold.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence considering the question's specifics and the provided options would involve the upload of malware as a post-exploitation action following the initial access.

**Final Answer: D**
