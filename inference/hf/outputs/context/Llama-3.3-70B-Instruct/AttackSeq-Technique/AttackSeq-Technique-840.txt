To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the WinDealer malware's execution, which involves reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData` and loading a DLL module into memory.
   - The malware is designed to steal information, including network configuration and details from SNS applications.
   - The report outlines various tactics used by the malware, including Execution, Defense Evasion, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Execution**: The malware executes and reads its configuration.
   - **Loading DLL**: A DLL module is loaded into memory.
   - **Collection/Discovery**: The malware collects information about the victim's PC and network configuration.
   - Other actions include defense evasion, command and control, and exfiltration.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware discovered information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - This implies we are looking for an action that happens after the malware's initial execution and configuration but before it starts collecting specific information about the system and network.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This involves using an external proxy to hide the malware's communications. While relevant to command and control, it's not directly related to the initial discovery of system information.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It could potentially happen early in the infection process but isn't directly linked to discovering system information.
   - **T1036-Masquerading**: This involves disguising the malware as a legitimate process or file. While important for evasion, it's not directly about discovering system information.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering software installed on the system. Given the context, this seems most directly related to the malware gathering information about the infected PC and its configuration before exfiltrating data.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware executes and configures itself.
   - To effectively collect relevant data, it would need to understand what software and configurations are present on the system.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery** fits as a logical step before the detailed collection of system and network information, as it would provide the malware with the necessary insights into what data is available for collection.

**Final Answer**: D
