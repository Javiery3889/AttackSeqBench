To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Taidoor campaign, which targets Taiwanese government organizations.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Social engineering and spoofing.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in software.
     3. **Execution**: Malware creates files, executes a small executable, and modifies the Windows Registry.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Produces identifiable network traffic with obfuscation.
     5. **Command and Control**: Communicates with C&C servers using HTTP and RC4 encryption.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Uploads files from infected machines.
     7. **Impact**: Leads to data theft, destruction, and potential DoS.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique that enables the Taidoor malware to maintain persistence on infected systems through automated actions during boot or logon, after executing a small executable file and modifying the Windows Registry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the modification of the Windows Registry and the creation of an autorun registry entry for persistence, as mentioned in the Execution and Command and Control sections.
   - The question specifically asks about maintaining persistence, which involves ensuring the malware remains active on the system even after reboot or logon.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the relevant ATT&CK technique related to persistence.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that modifying the Windows Registry to create an autorun entry is a method used to achieve persistence.
   - **Step 3**: Match this method with the provided answer choices to find the best fit.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication: This is related to authentication, not directly to persistence through boot or logon.
     - B: T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: This involves scripts that run at boot or logon but is more about executing scripts rather than the specific method of modifying the Registry for autorun.
     - C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically at system boot or user logon, which aligns with the creation of an autorun registry entry for persistence.
     - D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication: This is about communication between processes, not directly related to maintaining persistence through boot or logon.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the analysis, the technique that most likely enables the Taidoor malware to maintain persistence on infected systems through automated actions during boot or logon is related to autostart execution, which involves modifying the system to automatically execute the malware at boot or logon.

Final Answer: C
