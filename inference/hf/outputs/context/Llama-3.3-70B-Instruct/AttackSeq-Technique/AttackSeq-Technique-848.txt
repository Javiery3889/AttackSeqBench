To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack sequence ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, starting from Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and finally Exfiltration.
   - Key points include the execution of malicious code, establishing persistence, escalating privileges, evading defenses, accessing credentials, discovering the network, collecting data, establishing command and control, and exfiltrating data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after discovering critical systems and gaining valid credentials, as adversaries moved across the network.
   - The question implies a phase where the attackers are already inside the network, have discovered critical systems, and have gained valid credentials for legitimate access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already gained access to the network, discovered critical systems, and obtained valid credentials, they are likely in the phase of moving laterally within the network to achieve their objectives.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices need to be evaluated in the context of lateral movement and utilizing gained access for further objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (A)**: This technique involves using multiple communication channels to control the compromised infrastructure. While important, it's more about maintaining control rather than moving across the network.
   - **T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification (B)**: Modifying domain or tenant policies could be a way to move laterally or to escalate privileges, but it's not the most direct technique related to moving across the network after gaining credentials.
   - **T1021.007-Cloud Services (C)**: This technique involves using cloud services for command and control. It's relevant for maintaining access and control but is more specific to cloud services rather than general lateral movement within a network.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (D)**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network. Given that the attackers have valid credentials and are looking to move across the network, exploiting remote services is a plausible next step to further their objectives without needing to exploit vulnerabilities, as they already have legitimate access.

**Final Answer**: D
