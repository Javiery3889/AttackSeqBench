To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an APT campaign where the initial access is gained through a malicious file 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - Upon execution, the HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file and executes a backdoor in the background.
   - The malware uses VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing evasion techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
   - The malware also uses techniques for persistence and evasion, such as obfuscation and checking for file existence before deletion.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware employed a VB Script to extract and execute the payload during the initial access phase.
   - The key event here is the execution of the payload via VB Script, which is part of the initial access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial access has been established and the payload has been executed, the next steps would likely involve establishing persistence, evading defenses, or beginning to execute the main malicious activities.
   - **T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium** (A) involves exfiltrating data over non-standard network protocols, which could happen later in the attack but isn't directly related to the immediate actions after payload execution.
   - **T1106-Native API** (B) involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be used immediately after payload execution to establish persistence, gather information, or move laterally, aligning with the post-exploitation phase.
   - **T1566-Phishing** (C) is an initial access technique and wouldn't occur after the payload execution in this context.
   - **T1053.005-Scheduled Task** (D) involves scheduling tasks to execute at a later time, which could be a method for persistence but isn't the most immediate action after payload execution in terms of ATT&CK techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the immediate actions following the execution of the payload via VB Script.
   - The execution of the payload and the use of VB Script indicate that the malware is now interacting with the system.
   - The most likely next step involves using system calls or APIs to further the attack, which could include gathering information, establishing persistence, or preparing for lateral movement.
   - **T1106-Native API** is the most plausible next step as it directly relates to interacting with the system after initial access and payload execution, facilitating various post-exploitation activities.

Final Answer: B
