To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign named RevengeHotels targeting the hospitality sector.
   - **Initial Access**: The attack vector is spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0199.
   - **Execution**: Malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC are downloaded and executed. A module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com.
   - **Credential Access**: Attackers capture credit card data and sell credentials for remote access to hotel front desks, allowing other cybercriminals to steal more credit card details.
   - **Others**: The campaign has been active since at least 2015, targeting the hospitality sector with traditional RAT malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to collect additional data by monitoring OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites and hotel personnel activities after gaining remote access to hotel front desks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the use of a module called ScreenBooking, which captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. This indicates the attackers are interested in monitoring activities related to online booking systems to capture sensitive information.
   - The question specifically mentions monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities to collect additional data. This implies a technique focused on capturing input or data from the systems being monitored.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could include credit card information or other sensitive data entered into systems. Given the context of monitoring web pages and the interest in capturing credit card data, this technique aligns with the goals of the attackers as described.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: While phishing is used as an initial access vector in the campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the monitoring of activities or collection of data post-compromise.
   - **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This involves collecting data from existing repositories, which doesn't directly match the scenario of actively monitoring web pages or personnel activities for new data.
   - **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about using software deployment tools to deploy malware, which doesn't fit the scenario of monitoring activities for data collection.

Given the focus on capturing credit card data and monitoring web pages for specific activities, **T1056-Input Capture** is the most relevant technique for collecting additional data by monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.

**Final Answer: A**
