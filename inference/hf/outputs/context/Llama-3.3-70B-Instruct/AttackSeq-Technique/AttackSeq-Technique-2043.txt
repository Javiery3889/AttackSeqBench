To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report details an attack using BlackEnergy 3 malware, starting with **Initial Access** through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - **Execution** involves running a macro in an Excel document that executes a portable executable, leading to the deployment of additional malicious components.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by registering a binary to the startup shell.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery** involves gathering network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control** communication happens via HTTP to a specified IP address.
   - **Exfiltration** occurs through the malware's network sniffer capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used for lateral movement after gathering network information.
   - The answer choices involve different techniques related to exploiting services or creating tokens for access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already gained access to the network and is looking to move laterally, it needs to exploit existing services or credentials to do so.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** involves exploiting services that are available remotely, which could be a plausible next step after gathering network information to identify potential targets within the network.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is less likely since the malware is already inside the network and looking to move laterally, not targeting public-facing applications.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** is a broader category that could be relevant but is less specific than T1210 in the context of exploiting services for lateral movement.
   - **T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token** could be part of the process but seems more related to credential access and manipulation rather than the direct exploitation of services for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has gained initial access and is looking to move laterally within the network.
   - It has gathered network information, which would be used to identify potential targets or services to exploit.
   - The most direct method for lateral movement, given the context, would involve exploiting remote services that are accessible within the network.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred to enable lateral movement is the exploitation of remote services.

Final Answer: A
