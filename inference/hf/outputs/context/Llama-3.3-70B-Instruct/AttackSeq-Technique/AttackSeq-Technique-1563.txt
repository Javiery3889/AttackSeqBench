To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the SolarWinds incident, focusing on the Sunburst backdoor and its communication with a C2 server.
   - It mentions the backdoor's features overlapping with Kazuar, a .NET backdoor linked to the Turla APT group.
   - The report highlights the exploitation of Exchange vulnerabilities and the use of one or more vulnerabilities to obtain initial access and communicate with C2 servers.
   - Key MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned or implied include Command and Control (C2) and possibly Initial Access and Execution.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence implied in the report starts with an initial compromise (method not explicitly stated but implied to involve vulnerabilities), followed by the establishment of a backdoor for C2 purposes.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to establishing command and control using a backdoor with features overlapping with Kazuar.
   - The question essentially asks for the initial access technique used in the SolarWinds incident.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which is relevant to the post-exploitation phase rather than the initial access phase.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access. While possible, the report does not directly mention spearphishing as the initial access vector.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a supply chain to gain access to a target organization. The SolarWinds incident is known for its supply chain attack vector, where the attackers compromised SolarWinds' software development environment to insert the Sunburst backdoor into the Orion software updates.
   - **T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This involves using systemd timers for persistence, which is more relevant to maintaining access rather than gaining initial access.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The SolarWinds incident involved a supply chain compromise to insert malware into software updates, which were then downloaded and installed by target organizations.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the establishment of C2, which involves the initial access vector.
   - Given the context of the SolarWinds incident, the most plausible initial access technique is the supply chain compromise, as it directly relates to how the Sunburst backdoor was distributed.

**Final Answer: C**
