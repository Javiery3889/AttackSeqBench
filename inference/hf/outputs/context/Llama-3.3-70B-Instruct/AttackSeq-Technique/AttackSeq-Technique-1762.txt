To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attack started with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email, which executed a custom backdoor known as Pterodo.
     2. **Execution**: Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files, created scheduled tasks for persistence, and executed commands via scripts.
     3. **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks were created to ensure the backdoor remained active.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Utilized mshta.exe, scheduled tasks, and VBS scripts to evade detection.
     5. **Collection**: Deployed variants of the custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts, potentially for collecting and exfiltrating sensitive information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when Shuckworm downloaded additional payloads from their C&C servers after executing malicious VBS scripts and maintaining persistence through scheduled tasks.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves executing malicious scripts, maintaining persistence, and then downloading additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the action of downloading additional payloads from C&C servers. This action is related to transferring tools into the compromised environment.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** refers to the transfer of tools from a C2 server into the victim network, which aligns with downloading additional payloads.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is about creating scheduled tasks, which is mentioned in the report but is more about persistence rather than downloading payloads.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** involves using multiple proxies to hide the C2 traffic, which is not directly related to downloading payloads.
   - **T1555.001-Keychain** is related to obtaining credentials from keychains, which does not match the action of downloading payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report outlines a sequence of actions including initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and collection.
   - The question focuses on the action of downloading additional payloads after establishing persistence and executing scripts.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for downloading additional payloads from C&C servers is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches this technique.

Final Answer: A
