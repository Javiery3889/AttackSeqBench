To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Lazarus group against the defense industry.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Spear-phishing emails with personal information.
     2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
     3. **Execution**: Malware (ThreatNeedle) execution for reconnaissance and deploying additional malware.
     4. **Persistence**: ThreatNeedle installer-type malware for auto-execution.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques to evade detection, including log file deletion and masquerading.
     6. **Credential Access**: Executing a credential harvesting tool.
     7. **Discovery**: Conducting network and system discovery activities.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Using Windows commands and WMIC for network connections and copying malware.
     9. **Collection**: Archiving collected data for exfiltration.
     10. **Exfiltration**: Using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after utilizing a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router.
   - The key elements here are the use of a custom tunneling tool for exfiltration and the compromise of a router to access a restricted network segment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after exfiltration techniques were used, the attackers were able to overcome network segmentation and access the restricted network segment by compromising a router virtual machine.
   - The question specifically asks about enabling communication between the corporate and restricted network segments via a compromised router, which aligns with the lateral movement and exfiltration phases where network segmentation was overcome.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1070.006-Timestomp** (A) is related to modifying file timestamps to evade detection, which does not directly relate to enabling communication between network segments.
   - **T1090-Proxy** (B) involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which could be relevant in the context of leveraging a compromised router to access restricted segments.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** (C) is about discovering system network configurations, which, while relevant to the attack, does not directly pertain to using a compromised router for network access.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** (D) involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which could be relevant but does not directly address the use of a compromised router for segment access.

Given the context of the question and the details in the CTI report, the most relevant technique to enabling communication between the corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router after exfiltration would be related to using the compromised system (in this case, a router) as a proxy to access restricted areas. This aligns with the concept of using a proxy to redirect traffic or access restricted segments.

**Final Answer: B**
