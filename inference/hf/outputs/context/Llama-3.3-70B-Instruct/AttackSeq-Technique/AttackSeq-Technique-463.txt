To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Hidden Cobra targeting cryptocurrency and financial organizations, specifically the Turkish financial system, using the Bankshot malware implant.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     - **Resource Development**: Bankshot implants are distributed from a malicious domain, and the implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote access tool.
     - **Execution**: The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to download and execute the DLL implant.
     - **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.
     - **Defense Evasion**: The implant is designed to evade detection and can wipe files and content.
     - **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are:
     - **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: Developing capabilities could involve creating or obtaining malware, like the Bankshot implant.
     - **T1133-External Remote Services**: Using external remote services might not directly relate to the initial access phase described.
     - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, which could be part of reconnaissance but is more about post-access information gathering.
     - **T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is the technique used for initial access in the scenario described, but the question asks for what happened before this.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question asks for the technique that occurred **before** the initial access via spear phishing, we need to consider what would logically precede the use of phishing emails with a malicious document.
   - **T1587-Develop Capabilities** (Developing capabilities) is a plausible precursor because it involves the development or acquisition of tools, such as the Bankshot malware and the malicious Word document, which would be necessary before launching the phishing campaign.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services** doesn't directly fit as a precursor to the initial access method described.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** is more relevant to post-access activities.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is the method of initial access itself, not what happened before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack sequence starts with Hidden Cobra preparing for the attack, which includes developing or obtaining the necessary tools (malware, exploit) for the attack.
   - The development of these capabilities (the Bankshot implant and the malicious Word document) is a necessary step before the phishing campaign can be launched.
   - Therefore, the most logical technique that occurred before the initial access via phishing is the development of these capabilities.

Final Answer: A
