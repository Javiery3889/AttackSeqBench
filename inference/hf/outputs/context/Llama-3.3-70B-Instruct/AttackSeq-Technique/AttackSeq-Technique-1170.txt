To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's activities across several MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Utilizing back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
     2. **Defense Evasion**: Employing practices like wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols to avoid detection.
     3. **Discovery**: Malware is built for espionage with system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
     4. **Collection**: Malware has commands for remote control and can be customized for espionage-type operations.
     5. **Command and Control**: Configures specific domain and IP address combinations per target for C&C servers, using a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.
   - Key points relevant to the question include the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers and the emphasis on operational security to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection, after setting up communication with C&C servers.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a custom cryptographic protocol, which is a key detail for evaluating the answer choices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing malware or tools in a location that is not typically scanned by security tools, such as the Windows Registry or in memory. While Longhorn does employ in-memory string de-obfuscation, the question focuses on external communication, not storage.
   - **B & C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data in a scheduled, rather than continuous, manner. While Longhorn does randomize communication intervals, the question specifically mentions the use of a custom cryptographic protocol, which is more directly related to encrypting the communication channel rather than the scheduling of the transfer.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the communication channel between the malware and the C&C server. Given that Longhorn uses a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers, this option directly aligns with the details provided in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report highlights Longhorn's use of a custom cryptographic protocol for secure communication with C&C servers.
   - The question specifically asks about maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during external communication.
   - Among the provided options, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the technique that directly corresponds with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for encrypting the communication channel, which is essential for maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is the use of an encrypted channel for communication.

Final Answer: D
