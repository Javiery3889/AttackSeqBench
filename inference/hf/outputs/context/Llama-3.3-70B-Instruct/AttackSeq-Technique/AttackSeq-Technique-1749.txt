To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor TG1021.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers)
     3. Execution (of memory-resident malware)
     4. Persistence (using web shells and custom malware framework)
     5. Privilege Escalation (using custom tools and techniques)
     6. Defense Evasion (interfering with logging, evading EDRs)
     7. Credential Access (modifying login webpages to record credentials)
     8. Discovery (using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance)
     9. Command and Control (deploying an inline hook for backdoor functionality)

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used during TG1021's lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.
   - It mentions the use of PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance and leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on lateral movement, which involves moving from one system to another within the network.
   - Given that TG1021 has already gained access to the network, executed malware, and obtained credentials, the next step would involve using these credentials to move laterally.
   - The mention of accessing shared folders over SMB (Server Message Block) suggests the use of network shares to move between systems.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to find the one that best matches the technique of lateral movement using network shares.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This involves using cloud accounts for lateral movement, which does not match the context of using SMB for lateral movement within a network.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique is about gathering information on the victim, which is not directly related to lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services, such as SMB, to move laterally within a network. Given the context of accessing shared folders over SMB, this seems like the most relevant technique.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: Similar to option A, this focuses on cloud services, which does not align with the use of SMB for lateral movement within a network.

**Final Answer: C**
