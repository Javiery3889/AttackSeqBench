To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by DeathStalker involving:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files leading to arbitrary code execution.
     2. **Execution**: A multi-stage PowerShell-based implant called Powersing, with stages involving connecting to a dead drop resolver and obtaining cryptographic material.
     3. **Persistence**: Creating a shortcut in the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Evading security software and detecting virtualization/malware analysis tools.
     5. **Collection**: Capturing screenshots and executing PowerShell scripts from the C&C server.
   - Key points: The use of a dead drop resolver for obtaining the real C&C server address and the employment of PowerShell scripts throughout the attack.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the communication with the C&C server, specifically after establishing persistence and evading defenses.
   - It mentions the use of JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers.
   - The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique used in this context.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report highlights the use of a dead drop resolver to obtain the C&C server address, which involves dynamic resolution techniques.
   - The mention of JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers points towards a technique that involves using external services for resolving or communicating with the C&C server.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses to establish communication with the C&C server, which aligns with the use of dead drop resolvers and could involve JSON-encoded objects for communication.
   - **T1102-Web Service** could be a possibility but is more generic and doesnâ€™t specifically address the dynamic resolution aspect or the use of dead drop resolvers as described.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** is related to collecting screenshots, which is part of the Powersing's tasks but not directly related to C&C communication.
   - **T1568.003-DNS Calculation** is a sub-technique of Dynamic Resolution but is more specific to using DNS for calculation, which might not fully encompass the use of public services as dead drop resolvers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about the technique used for C&C communication involving JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers after establishing persistence and evading defenses.
   - The report details the use of a dead drop resolver for obtaining the C&C server address, which is a form of dynamic resolution.
   - Given the context, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the method of resolving the C&C server address dynamically, which can involve the use of public services and could include JSON-encoded objects for communication.

Final Answer: D
