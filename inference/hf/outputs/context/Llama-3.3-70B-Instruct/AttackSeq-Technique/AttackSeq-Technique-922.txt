To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Vulnerability scan of the target server.
     2. **Execution**: Injection of web shell code into the server, followed by the use of the Explosive Trojan, which includes a main executable and a DLL for backend API calls.
     3. **Persistence**: Installation of Explosive with various service names and paths.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques to avoid detection, including frequent version changes and monitoring memory consumption.
     5. **Credential Access**: Keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     6. **Lateral Movement**: Manual spread to the entire network using initially infected servers as a pivot, and potentially through USB infection.
     7. **Command and Control**: Use of a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after identifying exploitable web servers and prior to using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.
   - The key detail here is the spread within the network after initial exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the lateral movement phase, specifically how Volatile Cedar spreads within the target network after the initial exploitation.
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a service that is exposed to the network. Given that the initial attack involves exploiting web servers, this could be a plausible method for spreading within the network if other services are vulnerable.
   - **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is about exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. While this is how the initial exploitation occurs, the question asks about spreading within the network.
   - **T1480.001 - Environmental Keying**: This involves using environmental features to infer information about the system. It doesn't directly relate to spreading within a network.
   - **T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives. The report mentions a configurable option for USB infection in more recent versions of the Explosive Trojan, which aligns with this technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about spreading further into the target network after the initial exploitation.
   - The report highlights the use of initially infected servers as a pivot for manual spread and mentions the capability for USB infection in newer versions of the Explosive Trojan.
   - Given the context of spreading within the network and the specific mention of USB infection as a method for lateral movement, **T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media** seems the most relevant technique for spreading the malware within the network, especially considering the mention of infecting writable mass storage devices connected to the server.
   - However, the primary method described for lateral movement is manual spread using the initially infected servers, which could involve exploiting remote services. But since the question specifically mentions "prior to using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution," and given the emphasis on spreading within the network, the technique that directly involves network exploitation for spread isn't as directly implied as the use of removable media for lateral movement in the provided context.

**Final Answer: D**
