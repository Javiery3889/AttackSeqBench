To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
   - This is followed by **Execution** of malicious code through exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and using in-memory loaders.
   - The attackers then establish **Persistence** by creating a scheduled task.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used throughout the infection chain, including anti-analysis, anti-debugging, and anti-sandboxing.
   - After establishing a foothold, the attackers engage in **Collection**, which includes gathering a wide range of data from the victim's system.
   - The sequence then involves **Command and Control** communication, **Exfiltration** of data, and potential **Impact** through actions like shutting down the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the attackers collected detailed information about the victim's computer.
   - The answer choices involve different techniques: Cloud Service Dashboard (T1538), Steganography (T1001.002), System Information Discovery (T1082), and Screen Capture (T1113).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the collection of detailed information about the victim's computer, such as hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses.
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082)** directly involves collecting information about the system, which matches the description of gathering detailed system information.
   - **Steganography (T1001.002)** involves hiding data within other data, which doesn't directly relate to collecting system information.
   - **Cloud Service Dashboard (T1538)** involves using cloud services for command and control or data exfiltration, not directly related to collecting system information.
   - **Screen Capture (T1113)** involves capturing screenshots, which is a form of data collection but not specifically about system information like hostnames or OS versions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
   - Before collecting detailed system information, the attackers would need to have established a means to execute code and gather system details.
   - **System Information Discovery (T1082)** is the technique that directly aligns with collecting detailed information about the victim's computer, such as hostname, OS name and version, and MAC addresses.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is that **System Information Discovery (T1082)** occurred before the collection of detailed system information.

Final Answer: C
