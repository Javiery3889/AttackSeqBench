To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes various tactics and techniques used by an attack group over several years, including reconnaissance, persistence, credential access, and command and control.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - Reconnaissance and credential access attempts through phishing in 2011.
     - Use of a variant of the S-Type backdoor for compromise.
     - Adoption and customization of Android backdoors.
     - Utilization of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.
     - A notable attack campaign in June 2012 that leveraged a previously used flash exploit and an Internet Explorer zero-day.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the group leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks and execute a watering hole attack to deliver an Internet Explorer zero-day.
   - The specific technique in question is related to the events leading up to the exploitation of a vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the exploitation of an Internet Explorer vulnerability as part of a watering hole attack, which aligns with the June 2012 attack campaign mentioned in the report.
   - The techniques provided as answer choices are:
     - A: T1090-Proxy: This involves using a proxy to hide the true source of traffic. While proxies are used in the report, there's no direct indication this was used before the IE exploit.
     - B: T1547.012-Print Processors: This technique involves compromising print processors to move laterally within a network, which doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation of an IE vulnerability.
     - C: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain: This involves compromising hardware before it's delivered to the target, which is not indicated in the events leading up to the IE exploit.
     - D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a user's device merely by visiting a website, which aligns with the concept of a watering hole attack using an IE zero-day exploit.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the exploitation of an IE vulnerability in the context of a watering hole attack.
   - The report mentions the use of phishing and exploitation of vulnerabilities (like the IE zero-day in June 2012) as part of the attack group's tactics.
   - Given the context of a watering hole attack and the exploitation of an IE vulnerability, the most relevant technique that would occur before such an exploit would be related to how the attackers initially compromise systems or gather information.
   - However, the specific technique of using a drive-by compromise (T1189) is directly related to the method of exploiting vulnerabilities in software (like IE) to gain initial access, which fits the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: D**
