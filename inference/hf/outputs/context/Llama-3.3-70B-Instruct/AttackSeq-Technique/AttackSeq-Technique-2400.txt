To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Dark Seoul attackers, also known as Operation Troy.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: The attackers conducted basic reconnaissance on the infected host.
     2. **Initial Access**: The initial access vector was likely a spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
     3. **Execution**: The malware (TDrop2) executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware used process hollowing and obfuscated its payload to evade detection.
     5. **Command and Control**: The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host, after using process hollowing for defense evasion.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves executing a second-stage payload and then collecting information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the collection of information about active processes on the infected host after evading detection.
   - **T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions** (A) is unrelated to collecting process information.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** (B) refers to the establishment of an encrypted communication channel, which is relevant to Command and Control but not directly to collecting process information.
   - **T1012-Query Registry** (C) involves querying the Windows Registry, which could be part of reconnaissance but is not specifically about collecting information on active processes.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** (D) directly involves techniques for discovering information about running processes on a system, which aligns with the described behavior of collecting information about active processes after evading detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware used process hollowing to evade detection and then executed a second-stage payload.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the context of the question, would be to gather information about the system, specifically about active processes, to understand the environment and potentially identify targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** is the technique that directly corresponds to collecting information about active processes on the infected host.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report and the details provided in the question points to **T1057-Process Discovery** as the correct answer.

Final Answer: D
