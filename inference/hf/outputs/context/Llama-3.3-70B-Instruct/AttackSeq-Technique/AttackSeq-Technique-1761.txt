To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attack started with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email, which executed a custom backdoor known as Pterodo.
     2. **Execution**: Various VBS scripts and HTA files were executed to maintain presence and execute the backdoor. Scheduled tasks were created for persistence.
     3. **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks were used to ensure the backdoor remained active.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques like using mshta.exe and scheduled tasks were used to evade detection.
     5. **Collection**: Deployment of multiple variants of the custom VBS backdoor and execution of VBS scripts for potential data collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after deploying multiple variants of the custom VBS backdoor and executing VBS scripts, specifically for establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves post-compromise activities focused on communication and potential payload download.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context of establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads, we need to consider techniques that facilitate command and control (C2) communication and the ability to download or execute additional payloads.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which could be relevant for establishing communication with the attacker's servers.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Using non-standard ports for C2 communication is another method, but the report does not specifically mention the use of non-standard ports.
   - **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique is more related to containerized environments, which is not directly mentioned or implied in the report.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: While scheduled tasks were used for persistence, the question specifically asks about establishing communication and downloading payloads, which goes beyond mere persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report highlights the use of VBS scripts, scheduled tasks, and the deployment of a VNC client as part of the attack.
   - For establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and potentially downloading additional payloads, the attackers would need a reliable method for C2 communication.
   - Given the provided options and the context of the attack, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems the most plausible technique for this purpose. It aligns with the need for command and control communication without specifying the need for non-standard ports, container orchestration, or the more general use of scheduled tasks for persistence rather than active C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
