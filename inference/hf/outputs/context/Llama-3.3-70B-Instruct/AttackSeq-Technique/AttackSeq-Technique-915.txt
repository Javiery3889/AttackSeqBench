To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Tuyul botnet's capabilities, including execution, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control.
   - Key points relevant to the question include the use of PHP web shells, such as Tiny File Manager, to gain access to servers and the employment of a binary version of the malware that evades antivirus detection.
   - The report mentions the botnet's ability to execute commands on victim systems but does not explicitly state the initial access method.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems.
   - The question implies we are looking for an initial access technique that enabled the botnet to access vulnerable systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a network. Given the report's mention of using PHP web shells, including an open-source application like Tiny File Manager, this technique seems plausible as it could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications or using them as an entry point.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to access a network, which could potentially apply if the attackers used external services to gain initial access. However, the report does not provide direct evidence of this method being used for initial access.
   - **T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This is a sub-technique under the "Scheduled Task/Job" tactic, which doesn't directly relate to the initial access vector but rather to persistence or execution tactics.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, which is more related to the execution phase rather than the initial access phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Tuyul botnet's use of PHP web shells, such as Tiny File Manager, suggests that the attackers might have exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing web applications to gain initial access.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the use of external remote services or asynchronous procedure calls for initial access.
   - Command and scripting interpreters are used for executing commands, not for gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique for gaining initial access, based on the information provided, is exploiting public-facing applications, which aligns with the use of web shells mentioned in the report.

Final Answer: A
