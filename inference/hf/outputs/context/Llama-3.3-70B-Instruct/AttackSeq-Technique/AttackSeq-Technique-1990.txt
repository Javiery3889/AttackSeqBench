To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving several MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Resource Development (T1583.003, T1584)**: The adversary used compromised webservers and Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and malware C2s.
     2. **Initial Access (T1566, T1566.001)**: The adversary sent phishing emails with a PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.
     3. **Execution (T1204, T1204.002)**: The adversary tricked users into executing malware through malicious DLLs and DLL Hijacking.
     4. **Persistence (T1547.001, T1574.001, T1574.002)**: The adversary used the Run registry key, DLL Search Order Hijacking, and DLL Side-Loading to maintain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique most likely used after utilizing HTML Smuggling to deploy ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts, to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW (likely a reference to a security control or monitoring system).
   - The question mentions HTML Smuggling, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI report but implies a method to bypass security controls.
   - The answer choices involve different ATT&CK techniques:
     - **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
     - **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
     - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a need to evade detection or tagging by a security system (MOTW) after deploying malicious scripts.
   - **T1596.003-Digital Certificates** involves obtaining and using digital certificates to make malicious activities appear legitimate, which could help in evading detection.
   - **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** is about compromising infrastructure for use in operations, which is mentioned in the report but doesn't directly relate to evading detection after deployment.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** involves manipulating trust mechanisms to bypass security controls, which aligns with the goal of not being tagged by MOTW.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking** is not directly related to the evasion of security tagging or detection in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on evading detection or tagging by a security system after deploying malicious scripts.
   - The most relevant techniques to this goal are **T1596.003-Digital Certificates** and **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**, as both involve methods to make malicious activities appear legitimate or bypass security controls.
   - Between these, **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** directly addresses the manipulation of trust to bypass security controls, which aligns with the need to ensure malicious payloads are not tagged by MOTW after using HTML Smuggling.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW, given the context of the question and the CTI report, is **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**.

Final Answer: C
