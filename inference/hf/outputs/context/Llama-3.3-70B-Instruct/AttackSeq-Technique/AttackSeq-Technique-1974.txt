To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the use of fictitious login sites hosted on `com-login.mobi` to collect credentials.
   - These sites mimic Outlook Web Access, Yahoo, and Google login pages and are used in spear-phishing campaigns.
   - The link provided redirects users to a credential collection page before sending them to a YouTube clip.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access**: Likely through spear-phishing messages with links to fictitious login sites.
     2. **Credential Access**: Using fake login sites to collect credentials.
     3. **Execution/Redirect**: Redirecting users to a YouTube clip after credential collection.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the use of fake login sites for gaining covert access to targeted personnel accounts.
   - The focus is on what happened before the credential collection via fake login sites.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1606-Forge Web Credentials (A)**: This involves creating forged web credentials, which could be a step after collecting credentials but doesn't directly relate to the action before using fake login sites.
   - **T1003.004-LSA Secrets (B)**: This technique involves accessing Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which doesn't directly precede the use of fake login sites in a phishing context.
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks (C)**: This involves scanning IP blocks for open ports and services, which could be a reconnaissance step before targeting specific individuals with spear-phishing emails containing links to fake login sites.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography (D)**: This involves using symmetric cryptography for encryption, which doesn't directly relate to the steps before using fake login sites for credential collection.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question seeks the technique that occurred before the deployment of fake login sites.
   - The use of fake login sites is part of a spear-phishing campaign, which typically follows some form of reconnaissance or targeting.
   - Scanning IP blocks (T1595.001) could be part of the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets before sending them spear-phishing emails with links to fake login sites.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the context and the need for a technique that precedes the use of fake login sites in a spear-phishing campaign, **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks** seems the most plausible as it could be part of the initial reconnaissance to identify targets.

Final Answer: C
