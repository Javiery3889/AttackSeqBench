To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** where iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that can hide its icon, run in the background, and restart immediately if terminated on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase outlines the app's capabilities to collect various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates uploading files via FTP to the C2 (Command and Control) server after the XAgent app has collected information.
   - The question specifically mentions uploading files via FTP, which implies a method of transferring data from the compromised device to the attacker's server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The collected information (text messages, contact lists, processes) needs to be sent back to the attackers, which involves transferring data from the compromised device to the C2 server.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the technique that best matches the action of uploading collected data via FTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1204-User Execution** refers to executing malicious code by convincing a user to run it, which doesn't directly relate to uploading files to a C2 server.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS** is a technique used for making it difficult to track and block C2 servers by rapidly changing the IP address associated with the domain name, but it doesn't directly involve file upload.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** involves exploiting weaknesses in operating system elevation control mechanisms to gain higher privileges, which is not directly related to uploading files.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** involves transferring tools or files from the C2 server into the compromised system, but in the context of uploading collected data, the focus is on egress rather than ingress. However, considering the closest match in terms of transferring files and the fact that the question might imply a misunderstanding in the direction of transfer (since the actual technique for uploading would be more aligned with exfiltration), the closest ATT&CK technique related to transferring files (though typically for ingress) is mentioned here.

Given the context and focusing on the action of transferring data (collected information) from the compromised device to the C2 server, the most relevant technique related to file transfer in the ATT&CK framework that is listed, despite the direction of transfer, would be related to tool or data transfer. However, it's crucial to note that the precise technique for uploading files to a C2 server (exfiltration) isn't perfectly matched in the provided choices based on standard ATT&CK definitions. The closest in terms of file transfer (but typically for downloading tools into the victim system) is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**, yet the question's context implies an action that's the reverse of what T1105 describes.

**Final Answer: D**
