To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through compromised systems, leading to the installation of iOS malware.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that can hide its icon, run in the background, and restart after termination on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase involves the malware collecting various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server using POST and GET requests after gathering information from the compromised iOS device.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of POST and GET requests, which are HTTP methods used for communicating with web servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report does not explicitly mention the communication method with a C2 server but implies that after collecting data, the malware would need to send this information back to the attackers.
   - The use of POST and GET requests suggests a web-based communication method.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic, which does not directly relate to using POST and GET requests for C2 communication.
     - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication, which aligns with the use of POST and GET requests to interact with a web server.
     - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique is about discovering software on a system, which does not relate to C2 communication.
     - **D: T1001.001-Junk Data**: This sub-technique involves modifying data to make it unusable, which does not fit the context of communicating with a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitates communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests after data collection.
   - The report implies a need for C2 communication after data collection but does not specify the method.
   - The use of POST and GET requests points towards a web-based service for C2 communication.
   - Among the given choices, **T1102-Web Service** is the technique that involves using web services, which would include using POST and GET requests for communication with a C2 server.

Final Answer: B
