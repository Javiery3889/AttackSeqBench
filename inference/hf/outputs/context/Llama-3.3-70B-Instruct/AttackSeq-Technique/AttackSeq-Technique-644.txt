To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes two attack campaigns, Moafee and DragonOK, which use similar TTPs.
   - Initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - Custom-built backdoors and RATs, as well as publicly available RATs, are used to maintain access.
   - Techniques like environment-based evasion and password-protected documents are employed.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Not directly related to the question.
   - **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails.
   - **Execution**: Evasion techniques, including CPU core checks.
   - **Persistence**: Registry entries for startup persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control**: Network beacons and plugin functionality for additional payloads.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique used after initial access to ensure the deployment of tools like custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the deployment of tools after initial access.
   - **T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This involves using code signing certificates to make malicious code appear legitimate, which is not directly mentioned in the report as a method for deploying tools.
   - **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software or tools that can be used to support the campaign, which aligns with the deployment of custom-built backdoors and RATs after initial access.
   - **T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This involves modifying the appearance of a website or system, which is not relevant to deploying tools for maintaining access.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique, not the technique used after initial access for deploying tools.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique used after gaining initial access to deploy tools.
   - The report mentions the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs after initial access.
   - The technique that best matches the deployment of these tools for supporting the campaign is obtaining capabilities.

**Final Answer**: B
