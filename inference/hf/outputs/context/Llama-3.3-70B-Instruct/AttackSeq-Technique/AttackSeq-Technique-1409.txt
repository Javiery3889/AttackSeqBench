To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where attackers target Instagram users, particularly influencers, through phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram messages.
   - The attackers use these messages to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface.
   - After obtaining the credentials, the attackers change the account passwords, lock out the original owners, and download all images and messages from the accounts.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Initial Access**: Attackers use phishing and social engineering to trick victims into revealing their credentials.
   - **Credential Access**: Attackers collect credentials through phishing sites and use them to access the accounts, change passwords, and download data.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the attackers collected the victims' Instagram credentials but before they demanded ransom payments or continued with scams.
   - The relevant part of the attack sequence from the report is what happens after the attackers gain access to the credentials.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1125-Video Capture**: This involves capturing video from a device. It doesn't directly relate to the actions described after credential collection in the report.
   - **T1531-Account Access Removal**: This technique involves removing account access, which aligns with the attackers changing the account passwords and locking out the original owners after obtaining the credentials.
   - **T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This involves shutting down or rebooting systems, which is not mentioned or implied in the actions taken by the attackers after credential collection.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: While phishing was used for initial access, the question asks for the technique used after credential collection, not the method of initial access.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first gain access to the credentials through phishing.
   - After obtaining the credentials, they use them to access the accounts.
   - The next logical step mentioned in the report is that they change the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners, which is a form of account access removal.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after collecting credentials but before demanding ransom or continuing scams is the removal of the original account access.

**Final Answer: B**
