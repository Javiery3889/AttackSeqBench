To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
     2. **Execution**: Used the AntSword webshell to run commands, upload tools (including a custom Mimikatz variant, Impacket's wmiexec and atexec tools), and for initial system and user discovery.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Used a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
     4. **Credential Access**: Used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass the hash technique.
     5. **Discovery**: Ran commands for initial discovery.
     6. **Command and Control**: Used the AntSword webshell for communication and command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after using the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network, given the context of using the AntSword webshell and Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Impacket atexec tool is used for executing commands on other systems, which aligns with the **Credential Access** and **Lateral Movement** tactics.
   - After using atexec, the next logical step would involve using the accessed systems or credentials for further malicious activities.
   - **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material** involves using credentials or other authentication material (like those obtained through Mimikatz and used with Impacket tools) to access systems. This technique is directly related to the use of credentials obtained from one system to access others, fitting the context of using atexec for lateral movement and command execution on other systems.
   - **T1087 - Account Discovery** could be part of the initial discovery phase but doesn't directly follow the use of atexec in the context of utilizing accessed credentials for further system access.
   - **T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares** could be a method for lateral movement but is more specific to using Windows Admin Shares, which isn't directly mentioned in the context provided.
   - **T1137 - Office Application Startup** is related to persistence and doesn't directly follow the action of running commands on other systems using atexec.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools, including Mimikatz for credential dumping and Impacket tools for lateral movement.
   - The use of atexec for running commands on other systems implies movement within the network, likely facilitated by credentials or authentication material obtained earlier.
   - Given this context, the most logical next step after using atexec would be to use the accessed credentials or authentication material for further system access, which aligns with **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

Final Answer: C
