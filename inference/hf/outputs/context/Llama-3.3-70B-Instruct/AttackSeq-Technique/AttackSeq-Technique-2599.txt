To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes how HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactions.
   - It mentions the use of a skimmer to wait for customer keystrokes and send intercepted data to a controlled collection server.
   - Exfiltration methods involve a global network using hijacked legitimate sites to funnel stolen assets to dark web markets.
   - The report links the skimming activity to HIDDEN COBRA through reused infrastructure and distinctive malware code patterns.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence from the report can be summarized as: 
     1. Gaining access (implied, not directly stated but necessary for injecting scripts).
     2. Injecting malicious scripts into store checkout pages.
     3. Intercepting transactions and sending data to a collection server.
     4. Exfiltrating stolen data through a global network.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gaining credentials through spearphishing attacks and before inserting malicious scripts into store checkout pages.
   - The question implies a sequence where:
     1. Spearphishing is used to gain credentials.
     2. An unspecified technique is used.
     3. Malicious scripts are inserted into store checkout pages.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that spearphishing (a form of phishing) is used to gain credentials, we're looking for a technique that would logically follow the acquisition of credentials and precede the injection of malicious scripts.
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media** involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't directly follow from gaining credentials or precede injecting scripts into websites.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling** is about manipulating network traffic, which could potentially be related to exfiltration or communication but doesn't directly fit the sequence of gaining access and then injecting scripts.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is already mentioned as the method for gaining credentials (spearphishing is a type of phishing), so it's unlikely to be the answer since we're looking for a technique that occurs after phishing.
   - **T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups** involves adding accounts to local or domain groups, which could be a step after gaining credentials (to escalate privileges or ensure persistence) and before injecting malicious scripts into a system or website.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique that follows the initial access (gained through spearphishing) and precedes the injection of malicious scripts.
   - Given the context, the most plausible action after gaining credentials would be to ensure the attacker has sufficient privileges or access to perform the next steps, such as injecting scripts.
   - **T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups** fits this scenario as it involves modifying access or privileges, which would be necessary for injecting malicious scripts into store checkout pages without being detected or restricted.

**Final Answer: D**
