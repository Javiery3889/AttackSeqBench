To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a mobile APT attack by the Geumseong121 APT hacking group.
   - The attack involved distributing a malicious app (APK) via a website disguised as a fundraising service for North Korean defectors.
   - The website was used to trick users into installing the malicious app.
   - The attackers later made efforts to avoid suspicion by disguising the apps as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with **Reconnaissance**, where the attackers set up a website to distribute the malicious app.
   - The primary method of distribution was through a website that tricked users into installing the app, which falls under **Initial Access** in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique used to distribute the malicious app before the attackers evaded suspicion.
   - This implies we are looking for an **Initial Access** technique.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not directly mentioned in the report.
   - **T1566-Phishing** involves tricking users into performing certain actions, which aligns with the report's description of using a website to trick users into installing a malicious app.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** is related to defense evasion, not initial access.
   - **T1037.004-RC Scripts** is not directly relevant to the initial distribution method described.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The report highlights the use of a website to distribute a malicious app under the guise of a legitimate service.
   - This action is most closely related to tricking users into installing the app, which is a form of phishing.
   - Phishing is a common technique used for initial access in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the information in the CTI report and the nature of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for distributing the malicious app to gain access to victims before evading suspicion is through phishing.

Final Answer: B
