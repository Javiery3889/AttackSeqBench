To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the BlueDelta campaign's activities, which include:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Targeting Ukrainian government entities and exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gaining access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube and Microsoft Outlook.
     3. **Execution**: Executing malicious scripts through the exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscation techniques.
     5. **Credential Access**: Accessing credentials by exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     6. **Collection**: Collecting emails by creating a filter within Roundcube.
     7. **Command and Control**: Using web protocols for command and control.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over alternative protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the campaign gathered system, network configuration, and owner/user information, after exploiting Roundcube for reconnaissance and dumping OS credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key events mentioned are the exploitation of Roundcube for reconnaissance and the dumping of OS credentials.
   - The question is about what happened before gathering system, network configuration, and owner/user information.
   - **T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access** (A) involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials, which aligns with the exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities for credential access.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** (B) is about discovering the owner or user of a system, which would logically follow after gaining access and before deeper system exploration.
   - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules** (C) involves creating rules to hide email communications, which is part of the collection phase but not directly related to system or network discovery.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** (D) is about discovering the configuration of a system or network, which is what the question states happened after the technique in question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The BlueDelta campaign exploited Roundcube for reconnaissance and dumped OS credentials.
   - The next logical step before gathering system, network configuration, and owner/user information would involve discovering who the owners or users of the system are, as this would provide context for further actions.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** (B) is the technique that most likely occurred before the campaign gathered system, network configuration, and owner/user information, as it directly precedes the need to understand the system's configuration and network setup in the context of the users or owners.

Final Answer: B
