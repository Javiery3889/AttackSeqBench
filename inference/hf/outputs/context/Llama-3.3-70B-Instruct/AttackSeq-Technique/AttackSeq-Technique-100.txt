To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Bitter APT group targeting high-ranking officers of the Bangladesh police (RAB) via spear-phishing emails.
   - The emails contain malicious RTF documents or Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that exploit known vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, and CVE-2018-0802) to launch the Equation Editor application and run embedded shellcode.
   - The initial access is gained through these exploits, indicating the attackers are using the vulnerabilities to establish a foothold.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after exploiting known vulnerabilities to conceal the identity of the C2 (Command and Control) server during communication.
   - This implies we are looking for a technique related to communication and evasion, specifically how the attackers might hide their C2 server's identity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on post-exploitation activities, specifically on how the attackers might communicate with the compromised system without being detected.
   - The answer choices provided relate to different ATT&CK techniques:
     - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding schemes to hide the content of communication.
     - **T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or execute files, which could be used for communication but is more about transferring data.
     - **T1566-Phishing**: This is an initial access technique and does not relate to concealing C2 communication.
     - **T1090-Proxy**: This involves using a proxy to hide the true destination of the communication, effectively concealing the C2 server's identity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the question, which is about concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication after exploiting vulnerabilities, we need to identify the technique that best fits this purpose.
   - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** could be used for hiding the content of the communication but doesn't directly address concealing the C2 server's identity.
   - **T1197-BITS Jobs** is more about transferring data and not directly related to hiding the C2 server.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is an initial access technique and not relevant to post-exploitation communication.
   - **T1090-Proxy** directly addresses the need to conceal the identity of the C2 server by using a proxy, making it the most plausible choice for hiding the C2 server's identity during communication.

Final Answer: D
