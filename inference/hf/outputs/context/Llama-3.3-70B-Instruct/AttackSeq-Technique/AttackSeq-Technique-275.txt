To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** through compromised email accounts and the exploitation of the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability to install a fileless variant of the Helminth Trojan agent.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the exploitation of a vulnerability rather than macros, with the .hta file being executed by mshta.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used, including the regeneration of signatures and the use of a sophisticated Mimikatz script.
   - **Credential Access** is gained through a customized version of Mimikatz.
   - **Command and Control** is established through DNS exchange queries with a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to maintain the Helminth Trojan agent's presence by automatically executing files at regular intervals after the initial execution via mshta.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the mechanism used for persistence, which is hinted at through the mention of a "scheduled task added by the persistence mechanism" in the **Credential Access** section.
   - This implies that the attackers used a method to ensure the malware could execute automatically at regular intervals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the execution of files at regular intervals, which points towards a technique related to scheduling or automating tasks.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** directly relates to scheduling tasks to execute at regular intervals, which aligns with the need to maintain the Helminth Trojan agent's presence.
   - **T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs** is related to defense evasion by clearing logs, not scheduling tasks.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is about using application layer protocols for C2 communication, not about scheduling tasks.
   - **T1546.001-Change Default File Association** is related to persistence through changing file associations, which is not directly indicated in the report as the method for maintaining the Helminth Trojan's presence.

**Final Answer: B**
