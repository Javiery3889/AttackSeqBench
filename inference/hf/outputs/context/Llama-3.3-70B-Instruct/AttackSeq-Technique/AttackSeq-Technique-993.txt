To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via a phishing email, leading to the download of a ZIP file containing a VBS script. This script drops a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation** involves using the compromised client to gain admin privileges and then deploying a PowerShell RAT.
   - **Discovery** includes deploying Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance.
   - **Collection** and **Exfiltration** involve using SmartFTP Client to steal data.
   - **Command and Control** is established through various means, including a CARBANAK RAT and a PowerShell RAT.
   - **Impact** involves deploying RYUK ransomware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after achieving initial access and using a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor, specifically when the malware executed an obfuscated script and loaded a DLL file in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail in the question is the execution of an obfuscated script and the loading of a DLL file in memory. This action is not directly described in the initial steps of the CTI report but is related to how malware operates post-initial access.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control, which doesn't directly relate to executing scripts or loading DLLs.
   - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules** is about hiding malicious email content, which is not relevant to the execution of scripts or loading DLLs.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules** involves the use of shared modules, which could include loading DLLs, but the question's context suggests a more specific technique related to executing scripts and loading DLLs in memory.
   - **T1559.001-Component Object Model** refers to the use of the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code, which can involve loading DLLs and executing scripts in memory, fitting the description in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the technique used after initial access, specifically the execution of an obfuscated script and loading a DLL in memory.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique to this action is **T1559.001-Component Object Model**, as it directly involves executing scripts and loading DLLs in memory, which aligns with the behavior described in the question.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches this technique.

Final Answer: D
