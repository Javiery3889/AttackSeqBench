To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the AtomBombing technique, which is used for Defense Evasion.
   - It involves injecting malicious code into trusted processes to bypass security products.
   - The technique allows for accessing sensitive data and does not require exploiting OS bugs or vulnerabilities.
   - The key point here is the injection of malicious code into trusted processes.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled attackers to execute malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables after evading detection.
   - The question specifically mentions the AtomBombing technique and its use in bypassing process-level restrictions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The AtomBombing technique is directly related to injecting malicious code into trusted processes, which aligns with the concept of Process Injection.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to find the one that best matches the description of executing malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms and is related to process injection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1053.003-Cron**: This is related to scheduled tasks and does not directly relate to the AtomBombing technique or injecting code into processes.
   - **B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**: This involves hijacking dynamic libraries, which is more relevant to macOS than Windows and does not directly relate to the AtomBombing technique.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: While this involves using native APIs, which could be part of how AtomBombing operates, it's not as directly related to injecting code into processes as another option is.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**: This directly involves injecting malicious code into running processes, which is exactly what the AtomBombing technique is described as doing in the CTI report.

Given the information in the CTI report and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to injecting malicious code into trusted processes, which is a direct characteristic of Process Injection.

**Final Answer: D**
