To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions various methods of initial access, including the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Citrix systems and the use of password spraying techniques.
   - It highlights the use of malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla for reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data theft.
   - Defense evasion techniques, such as using encrypted HTTPS connections, are also mentioned.
   - Credential access is a significant aspect, with credential stealing and stuffing being common tactics.
   - The report discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybersecurity, with increased attacks on healthcare and remote workers.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Various methods including exploitation of Citrix vulnerabilities and password spraying.
   - Execution: Installing malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla.
   - Defense Evasion: Using encrypted HTTPS connections.
   - Credential Access: Credential stealing and stuffing.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique likely involved in gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target through the Reconnaissance phase before exploiting vulnerabilities in Citrix systems and employing password spraying.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the reconnaissance phase, which precedes the initial access techniques mentioned (exploiting Citrix vulnerabilities and password spraying).
   - The correct answer should relate to gathering information or scanning for vulnerabilities.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (A)**: This technique involves hiding or disguising malicious data or files, which doesn't directly relate to gathering information about vulnerabilities.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning (B)**: This technique involves actively scanning for vulnerabilities or open ports/services, which aligns with gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target before exploiting them.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials (C)**: This sub-technique is about stealing credentials, not directly related to scanning for vulnerabilities.
   - **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection (D)**: This technique is about injecting malicious code into image files, not related to reconnaissance or scanning for vulnerabilities.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Given the context of the question, which asks about gathering information about vulnerabilities before exploiting them, **T1595-Active Scanning (B)** is the most relevant technique. It directly relates to the reconnaissance phase and the action of scanning or gathering information about potential vulnerabilities in the target system, such as those in Citrix systems, before attempting to exploit them.

**Final Answer: B**
