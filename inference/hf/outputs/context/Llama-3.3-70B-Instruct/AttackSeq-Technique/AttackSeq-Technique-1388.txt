To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a malware distribution campaign using Telegram to distribute Raccoon stealer.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting Telegram's features, using phishing pages, and mailings with malicious macros.
     2. **Execution**: Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and more.
     3. **Command and Control**: Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers via Telegram to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Raccoon stealer bypassed blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the execution of the Raccoon stealer and its communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Raccoon stealer's execution and its ability to communicate with C&C servers via Telegram imply that some form of obfuscation or evasion technique was used to bypass detection.
   - Given the context, the technique that most likely occurred before the stealer bypassed blocking involves how the malware was delivered or executed without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This is an initial access technique, not directly related to the bypassing of blocking or the communication with C&C servers after the malware is executed.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data or files hard to detect, which aligns with the malware's ability to bypass blocking and communicate with C&C servers without detection.
   - **C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique is related to modifying permissions, which is not directly relevant to the scenario of bypassing network blocking to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1010-Application Window Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the applications running on a system, which does not directly relate to the bypassing of network blocking for C&C communication.

Given the context and the need for the malware to bypass detection to communicate with its C&C servers, the most plausible technique that occurred before this communication would involve obfuscation or evasion to avoid being blocked.

**Final Answer: B**
