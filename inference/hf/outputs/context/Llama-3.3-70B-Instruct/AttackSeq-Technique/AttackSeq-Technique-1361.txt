To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence starts with **Initial Access** using the CVE-2015-5119 exploit.
   - The exploit saves and executes a file named "%Temp%/Rdws.exe".
   - This executable writes another file, "%TEMP%/adobe.dat", which acts as a first-stage downloader.
   - The first-stage downloader retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
   - The PlugX file connects to several Command and Control (C2) domains, including those beginning with "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com".

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with C2 domains (such as "inocnation[.]com", though the report mentions "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com") after the exploitation and the retrieval of the second-stage PlugX file.
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by the malware (in this case, PlugX) to interact with its C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the communication between the PlugX malware and its C2 domains.
   - **T1001.002-Steganography** involves hiding data in non-malicious files, which is not directly indicated by the report as the method of communication with C2.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** refers to the use of standard application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario of connecting to C2 domains.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** is related to the initial exploitation of a system, not the communication with C2 servers after the compromise.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** involves collecting data from the local system, which does not directly relate to the communication method with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report indicates that after the initial exploitation and the retrieval of the PlugX malware, the malware connects to C2 domains.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action (communicating with C2 domains) is using standard application-layer protocols, as it is the most common method for malware to communicate with its C2 servers over the internet.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely facilitated the communication with C2 domains such as "inocnation[.]com" (or "cdn[.]sanecat[.]com" as mentioned in the report) is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: B
