To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber-espionage campaign targeting Android users via the malicious Welcome Chat app.
   - The key steps in the attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics are:
     1. **Initial Access**: The Welcome Chat app is installed on the device, likely through a dedicated website.
     2. **Discovery**: The app collects device information, including GPS location.
     3. **Collection**: The app exfiltrates various data such as SMS messages, call logs, and user photos.
     4. **Command and Control**: The app sends device information to its C&C server and receives commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique ensures the Welcome Chat app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts, after it has collected device information, including GPS location.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves persistence, specifically how the app maintains its functionality upon device restart.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the app's ability to contact its C&C server every five minutes and its need to persist on the device to continue exfiltrating data.
   - The question focuses on the technique that allows the app to start automatically upon device boot, ensuring continuous data collection and communication with the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the need for persistence. The app needs to collect data continuously, including after the device restarts.
   - **Step 2**: Match this need with the provided ATT&CK techniques.
     - **T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass** is related to bypassing security warnings when executing files marked as coming from the internet, which doesn't directly relate to autostarting an app.
     - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** involves techniques that allow malware to execute automatically upon system boot or logon, which matches the requirement for the app to start automatically.
     - **T1546.014-Emond** and **T1125-Video Capture** do not directly relate to ensuring an app starts automatically upon device boot.
   - **Step 3**: Select the technique that best aligns with the requirement for the app to autostart.

**Final Answer: B**
