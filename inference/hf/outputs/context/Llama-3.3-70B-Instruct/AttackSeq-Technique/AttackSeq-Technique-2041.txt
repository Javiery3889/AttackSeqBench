To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The sequence can be summarized as follows based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Leveraging a vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114) in Microsoft Office 2013 to infect systems with BlackEnergy 3 malware through Excel documents.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes through a Visual Basic macro in an Excel document, leading to the execution of additional malicious executables.
     3. **Persistence**: The malware achieves persistence by registering a binary to the startup shell.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: It uses various anti-debugging techniques.
     5. **Discovery**: It gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API for lateral movement.
     6. **Lateral Movement**: Designed for lateral movement, sending data to servers.
     7. **Command and Control**: Communicates with its C2 server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to send captured data (network information gathered for lateral movement) to the C2 server.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves data gathering for lateral movement and then communicating with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the CTI report is that after gathering network information, the malware communicates with its C2 server using the HTTP protocol.
   - The question is about the technique used to send this captured data to the C2 server.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control channel. Given that the malware sends localization data and keyboard layout information to the C2 server, this seems like a plausible next step after gathering network information.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a client. It doesn't directly relate to sending data to a C2 server.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. While the malware does use HTTP (an application layer protocol) to communicate with its C2 server, this option is more about the protocol used rather than the action of sending data to the C2 server.
   - **T1537-Transfer Data to Cloud Account**: This involves transferring data to a cloud account, which is not mentioned in the CTI report as the method for communicating with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines the malware's ability to gather network information and then communicate with its C2 server.
   - The question specifically asks about the technique used to send captured data to the C2 server.
   - Given the details, **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the most relevant technique as it directly involves sending data (in this case, network information) over the established command and control channel.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** could be considered relevant due to the use of HTTP, but it's more about the method of communication rather than the act of sending data to the C2 server for the purpose described.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the one that directly addresses the sending of data to the C2 server after it has been gathered.

Final Answer: A
