To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions the Kingslayer backdoor and its use of a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for defense evasion.
   - It highlights that the backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised between 09 April 2015 to 25 April 2015.
   - The backdoor's unusual beaconing pattern and the use of a stolen code signing key are key points for evasion and initial deployment.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Compromise of Alpha's software packaging system to obtain a code signing private key.
   - Use of the stolen key to sign the Kingslayer backdoor.
   - Deployment of the backdoor into target environments, leveraging the trusted signature for evasion.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion before employing defense evasion tactics.
   - The focus is on the initial deployment method, specifically looking for a technique related to supply chain compromise.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question points towards a supply chain compromise as the method for initial deployment.
   - The CTI report mentions the compromise of Alpha's software packaging system, which implies a supply chain compromise to obtain the code signing key.
   - **T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise** directly relates to compromising the supply chain, which could involve stealing code signing keys to make malicious software appear legitimate.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Kingslayer backdoor's deployment into enterprise environments was facilitated by being signed with a trusted certificate, which was stolen from a compromised software packaging system.
   - This indicates a supply chain compromise, as the attackers targeted the system used to package and sign software, allowing them to sign their malware with a legitimate key.
   - The question specifically asks for the technique that facilitated this deployment, pointing towards a supply chain compromise.

6. **Final Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain** is too specific to hardware and does not directly relate to the theft of a code signing key from a software packaging system.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** is the most relevant, as it directly addresses the compromise of the supply chain, which can include the theft of code signing keys to subvert software.
   - **C: T1021.005-VNC** and **D: T1219-Remote Access Software** are not relevant to the initial deployment via supply chain compromise.

**Final Answer: B**
