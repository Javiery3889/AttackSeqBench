To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Mustang Panda that starts with **Initial Access** via spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files.
   - These files contain embedded HTA scripts that execute malicious payloads, including dropping Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX malware, while showing decoy documents.
   - **Execution** involves the use of VBscript or PowerShell scripts within the '.lnk' files to run various operations.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include the use of the double extension trick to deceive users into opening malicious files and utilizing payloads like PlugX and Cobalt Strike.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after initial access and defense evasion.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files for initial access and the double extension trick for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial access has been achieved and defense evasion techniques have been employed, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve establishing communication with the compromised systems.
   - The question is about the technique used for communication, which would fall under the **Command and Control (C2)** category of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the one that best aligns with C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication, which could include HTTP, FTP, etc. Given that the attackers are using sophisticated tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX, it's plausible they would use standard application layer protocols for communication to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding schemes for C2 communication. While possible, the report does not specifically mention the use of non-standard encoding for communication.
   - **C: T1010-Application Window Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering application windows, which does not directly relate to establishing C2 communication.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is an initial access technique, not relevant to establishing communication with already compromised systems.

Given the context and the need for a technique that facilitates communication with compromised systems, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems the most plausible choice as it directly relates to command and control communication, which would be necessary after initial access and defense evasion have been successful.

**Final Answer: A**
