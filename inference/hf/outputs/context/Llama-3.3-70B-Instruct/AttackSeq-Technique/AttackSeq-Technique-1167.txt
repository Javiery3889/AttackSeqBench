To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Longhorn group's activities, starting with **Initial Access** through zero-day exploits and backdoor Trojans.
   - It mentions the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - The report then details **Discovery**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, and **Exfiltration** tactics, highlighting the group's focus on espionage and operational security.
   - Key points include the customization of malware, the use of specific domain and IP address combinations for C&C servers, and the implementation of secure communication protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Longhorn utilized secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection, following the implantation of malware through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of secure erase protocols, which implies actions taken to remove indicators of compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report highlights Longhorn's operational security measures, including the use of custom cryptographic protocols for communication and the configuration of specific C&C servers per target.
   - The mention of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection aligns with techniques used to remove indicators of compromise, which is a part of **Indicator Removal (T1070)** in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **T1070 - Indicator Removal** involves techniques used to remove indicators from a compromised environment to avoid detection. This includes secure deletion or overwriting of files, which matches the description provided in the question.
   - The other options (A: T1078.001-Default Accounts, B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice, C: T1566-Phishing) do not directly relate to the actions taken after implanting malware to avoid detection through secure erase protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about actions taken after malware implantation to avoid detection, focusing on secure erase protocols.
   - The CTI report details Longhorn's operational security measures, including those that would be classified under **Indicator Removal**.
   - Given the context of avoiding detection and the specific mention of secure erase protocols, the most relevant ATT&CK technique is **T1070 - Indicator Removal**.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to this technique.

Final Answer: D
