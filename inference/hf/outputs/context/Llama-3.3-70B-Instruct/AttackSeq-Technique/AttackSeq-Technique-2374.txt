To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a sophisticated malware system with components netsat.exe, netui3.dll, and winmgt.dll.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives when reconnected.
   - **Execution**: netsat.exe operates as a master program, infecting media and collecting data, with netui3.dll and winmgt.dll serving as field units.
   - **Discovery**: Malware components collect detailed system information.
   - **Collection**: Data is collected in the form of files, possibly obfuscated.
   - **Command and Control**: Accomplished via commands in an encrypted file on the local 'master' system.
   - **Exfiltration**: Means not determined but suggested to be via another piece of code or access to the 'master' system.
   - The malware self-deletes if the system date is past a hardcoded date.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware employed features to delete itself past a hardcoded date.
   - The techniques to consider are:
     - A: T1556-Modify Authentication Process
     - B: T1082-System Information Discovery
     - C: T1480-Execution Guardrails
     - D: T1590.002-DNS

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The self-deletion feature based on a hardcoded date suggests the malware has a specific operational window or is designed to evade detection after a certain period.
   - **T1556-Modify Authentication Process** involves modifying authentication processes to make it easier for the adversary to access the system in the future. This doesn't directly relate to the self-deletion feature or the primary function of the malware described.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** involves collecting information about the system and its components. Given the malware's components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) collect detailed system information, this technique is directly related to the malware's functionality before it would self-delete.
   - **T1480-Execution Guardrails** refers to implementing security measures to prevent or limit the execution of malicious code. This is not directly related to the malware's actions before self-deletion but rather to potential defensive measures against such malware.
   - **T1590.002-DNS** involves using DNS for command and control. While the malware does use a form of command and control, it's specified as being through an encrypted file on the local system, not explicitly through DNS.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's primary function before self-deletion involves collecting data and system information.
   - The technique that most closely aligns with the actions the malware takes before it self-deletes, based on the provided information, is collecting system information.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the malware's self-deletion feature is activated would involve **System Information Discovery**.

Final Answer: B
