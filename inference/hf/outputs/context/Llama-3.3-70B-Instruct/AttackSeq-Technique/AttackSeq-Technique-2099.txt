To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through spear phishing emails containing RTF files with embedded malware. These files exploit vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) to gain remote access to victims' computers.
   - The report mentions the attackers' use of a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts for interacting with their infrastructure, indicating a method to maintain anonymity and facilitate communication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after gaining remote access, specifically for facilitating communication between the malware and the framework's cloud infrastructure.
   - The question is focused on the communication aspect post-exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context of needing to communicate with the cloud infrastructure after initial access, we need to consider techniques that would allow for such communication while potentially evading detection.
   - **T1566-Phishing** (A) is the initial access technique, not relevant to post-exploitation communication.
   - **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path** (B) is related to privilege escalation, not directly relevant to communication with external infrastructure.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** (C) involves using multiple proxies to obscure the source of traffic, which aligns with the report's mention of a "complex network of router proxies and rented hosts" used by the attackers to interact with their infrastructure.
   - **T1102-Web Service** (D) could be relevant for communication, but the report specifically highlights the use of proxies and rented hosts, suggesting a more indirect method of communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers gained initial access through spear phishing and exploits.
   - They utilized a complex infrastructure for anonymity and communication.
   - The need is to identify the technique that best matches the method used for communication post-exploitation.
   - Given the emphasis on anonymity and the use of proxies, **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** (C) is the most plausible technique for facilitating communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure while maintaining operational security.

Final Answer: C
