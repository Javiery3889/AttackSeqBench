To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FIN13, a threat actor. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - Execution: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution and using passive backdoors.
   - Persistence: Using methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and deploying specific malware.
   - Privilege Escalation: Utilizing techniques such as dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials.
   - Defense Evasion: Employing tactics like using passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for evasion.
   - Credential Access: Obtaining credentials through process memory dumping and network sniffing.
   - Discovery: Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - Lateral Movement: Using WMI to execute commands remotely.
   - Collection: Collecting data from network shared drives.
   - Command and Control: Using proxies and protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers. This implies we are looking for a technique that precedes the initial access phase, which involves reconnaissance or preparation that would lead to identifying vulnerable external servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs**: This involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for command and control, which doesn't directly relate to the pre-initial access phase.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This is a technique used for persistence and privilege escalation, not for initial access or pre-access reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the environment, which is more relevant to post-initial access activities.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which could include identifying potential vulnerabilities in external servers. This would be a logical precursor to exploiting those servers for initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access.
   - Initial access involves exploiting external servers, which implies that some form of reconnaissance or information gathering about the target would be necessary beforehand.
   - Among the given options, **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** is the most relevant to the pre-initial access phase as it involves gathering information that could be used to identify vulnerabilities in external servers.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access is gathering victim network information.

Final Answer: D
