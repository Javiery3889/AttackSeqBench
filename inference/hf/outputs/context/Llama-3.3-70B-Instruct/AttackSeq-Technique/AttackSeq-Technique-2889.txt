To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes various tactics used by adversaries, including Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, and Discovery.
   - The Discovery tactic involves gathering system information and manipulating thread contexts, which is relevant to the question.
   - The report mentions the use of specific functions for registry queries and thread context manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols after discovery techniques.
   - The question implies a sequence where discovery is followed by a communication establishment technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The discovery techniques mentioned in the report involve querying registry values and manipulating thread contexts.
   - For establishing communication, especially using HTTP and HTTPS protocols, we need to consider techniques that involve network communication.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to communicate with command and control servers. While it does involve network communication, it's more about proxying traffic rather than the initial establishment of communication using HTTP/HTTPS.
     - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique is about causing a denial-of-service condition on a network, which does not directly relate to establishing communication for command and control.
     - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for communication. Given the context of establishing communication after discovery, this seems highly relevant.
     - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be part of the process but does not directly imply the use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used after discovery to establish communication via HTTP and HTTPS.
   - The discovery phase, as described, involves gathering information and setting the stage for further actions.
   - Establishing communication for command and control or data exfiltration typically follows discovery in an attack sequence.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** directly involves using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS for communication, which aligns with the requirement of establishing communication after the discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report would involve using application layer protocols for communication after discovery.

Final Answer: C
