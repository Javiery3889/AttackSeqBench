To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CostaRicto Campaign, which used stolen credentials for initial access.
   - It utilized SSH tools for remote tunneling and executed payload stagers to download a backdoor.
   - The campaign employed various techniques for execution, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and command and control.
   - Specifically, for collection, the SombRAT backdoor archived collected data in a custom storage file format.
   - For command and control, the backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with the traffic being SSL-encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer data from the victim's system after the SombRAT backdoor archived the collected data.
   - The answer choices involve different techniques: exfiltration over USB, shared modules, domain properties, and exfiltration over a C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the SombRAT backdoor archived collected data and communicated with C2 servers over encrypted channels.
   - Given this context, the most plausible method for transferring the archived data would be through the existing command and control channel, as it is already established and secured.
   - Exfiltration over USB (A) would require physical access to the device, which is not indicated in the report.
   - Shared Modules (B) and Domain Properties (C) do not directly relate to the transfer of collected data from the victim's system.
   - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (D) aligns with the report's description of the backdoor's communication with C2 servers and the use of encrypted traffic, making it the most likely method for transferring the archived data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method used by the SombRAT backdoor for archiving collected data and its communication method with C2 servers.
   - **Step 2**: Evaluate each answer choice against the information provided in the CTI report.
   - **Step 3**: Determine the most plausible technique for transferring the archived data based on the established communication channels and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the use of encrypted communication with C2 servers and the archiving of collected data, the most logical choice for transferring this data is through the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: D
