To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gamaredon group's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
     2. **Execution**: Employing scripting and using rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs.
     3. **Persistence**: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscated files, modifying registry keys, and employing code signing.
     5. **Discovery**: Automatically listing interesting files for future exfiltration.
     6. **Lateral Movement**: Injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macro to send emails.
     7. **Collection**: Searching for sensitive documents and scanning drives for sensitive data.
     8. **Command and Control**: Using both HTTP and HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server after using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves command and control (already established) followed by the exfiltration of harvested documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question specifies the action of uploading harvested documents to the C&C server, we need to identify the technique that aligns with exfiltrating data over the established command and control channel.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits** refers to restricting the size of data transfers, which doesn't directly relate to the act of exfiltrating data.
   - **T1137.006-Add-ins** involves modifying or adding to existing applications, which is not directly related to uploading documents to a C&C server.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** directly involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which matches the scenario described.
   - **T1106-Native API** involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is not directly related to the act of uploading documents to a C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of uploading harvested documents to the C&C server after establishing command and control.
   - The technique that directly involves exfiltrating data over an established command and control channel is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is exfiltrating data over the command and control channel.

Final Answer: C
