To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the XAgent app, an iOS malware part of Operation Pawn Storm.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7, restarting immediately if terminated. It doesn't hide its icon or restart on iOS 8.
   - **Command and Control**: The app collects information and sends it via HTTP (POST for sending, GET for receiving commands). It also uses FTP for file uploads.
   - **Others**: The malware's design suggests it was created before iOS 8's release, and it uses a token for module identification.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to collect geo-location data after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7.
   - The answer choices involve different ATT&CK techniques: Data Encoding, Pluggable Authentication Modules, System Location Discovery, and System Owner/User Discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically asks about collecting geo-location data, which directly relates to discovering the system's location.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding** is about encoding data to avoid detection, not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules** involves using pluggable authentication modules for authentication, not related to geo-location.
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery** involves collecting information about the system's location, which matches the question's context about collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** is about identifying the system's owner or user, not directly related to geo-location.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The XAgent app's ability to collect information from the iOS device and send it via HTTP suggests it can gather various types of data.
   - Given the context of collecting geo-location data, the most relevant ATT&CK technique is the one directly related to discovering the system's location.
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery** is the technique that aligns with collecting geo-location data from the device.
   
Final Answer: C
