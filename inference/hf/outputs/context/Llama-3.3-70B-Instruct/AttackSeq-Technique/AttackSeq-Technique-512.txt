To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a malicious campaign named WildPressure that distributes a C++ Trojan called Milum.
   - The Trojan achieves persistence through HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce.
   - It uses base64-encoded JSON data for configuration and transmits compressed JSON data in HTTP POST requests, encrypted with RC4, for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after achieving persistence to transmit encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests for C2 communication.
   - The key elements here are the use of HTTP POST requests and the transmission of encrypted and compressed data for command and control (C2) purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after achieving persistence, the malware transmits compressed JSON data in HTTP POST requests, encrypted with RC4, for C2 communication.
   - This action involves using an application layer protocol (HTTP) to communicate with the C2 infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary action described in the question, which is the transmission of encrypted and compressed JSON data via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that this action is part of the command and control (C2) communication process.
   - **Step 3**: Match this action with the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices.
   - **Step 4**: Eliminate choices that do not directly relate to the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication.
     - **A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information** is about gathering information and does not directly relate to C2 communication.
     - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** refers to protocols not at the application layer, which does not match the use of HTTP.
     - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is about achieving persistence, which is already mentioned as achieved through HKCU autorun system registry keys.
   - **Step 5**: Select the choice that aligns with using HTTP for C2 communication.
     - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the technique that involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication, which matches the description in the report.

**Final Answer**: B
