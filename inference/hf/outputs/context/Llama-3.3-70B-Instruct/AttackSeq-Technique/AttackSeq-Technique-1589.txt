To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the T9000 malware's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution**: Involved sideloading a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) using a legitimate Microsoft executable (igfxtray.exe).
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques used to evade detection, including customization to avoid security products and multi-stage installation.
     4. **Collection**: Capture data about the infected system, steal specific files, and target Skype communications.
     5. **Command and Control**: Communicate with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrate various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.
   - Key detail for our question: The malware used "three techniques for persistence, including setting registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process."

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot, after DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe.
   - The question focuses on persistence and autostart execution techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions "three techniques for persistence," which directly relates to ensuring the malware runs or loads with every user mode process after a system reboot.
   - Among these techniques, "setting registry keys" is a common method for achieving persistence, as it allows malware to be executed automatically when the system boots up or a user logs in.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly corresponds with the concept of ensuring malware components run at boot or logon time, which matches the description of setting registry keys for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring T9000's components run with every user mode process after reboot, which points towards persistence techniques.
   - The report highlights the use of registry keys for persistence, which aligns with autostart execution techniques.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the technique that best matches the description of using registry keys to ensure the malware runs at system boot or user logon, thereby ensuring it loads with every user mode process spawned after a reboot.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the persistence mechanism described in the report.

Final Answer: C
