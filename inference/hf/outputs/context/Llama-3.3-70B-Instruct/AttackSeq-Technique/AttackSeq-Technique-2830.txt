To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a malware campaign attributed to ReconHellcat, delivering a remote access Trojan (RAT) named BlackSoul.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing email delivering a CAB archive.
     2. **Execution**: Malicious loader uses obfuscation techniques and retrieves files from C2 infrastructure.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques.
     4. **Credential Access**: The DLL searches for browser data and decodes C2 URLs.
     5. **Collection**: BlackSoul is capable of file transfers and running arbitrary commands.
     6. **Command and Control**: BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer data over the C2 channel after BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves establishing C2 communication and then transferring data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that BlackSoul is capable of file transfers and running arbitrary commands, and it communicates with the C2 server for executing commands and transferring files, we need to identify the technique that best matches data transfer over the established C2 channel.
   - **T1558.001-Golden Ticket** involves creating a forged Kerberos ticket, which doesn't directly relate to transferring data over a C2 channel.
   - **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol that is symmetrically encrypted, which doesn't exactly match the use of RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding for C2 communication.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** involves automatically exfiltrating data, which could align with BlackSoul's capabilities of transferring files and running commands, but it's broader and doesn't specifically mention the use of a C2 channel for data transfer in the context provided.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data** involves archiving data, which might be part of the process but doesn't directly address the method of transferring data over the C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about transferring data over the C2 channel after establishing communication.
   - BlackSoul's capabilities include file transfers and running arbitrary commands, indicating it can exfiltrate data.
   - The most relevant technique to transferring data (exfiltration) in the context of an established C2 channel, especially considering the specifics of the question, would be **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**, as it directly relates to the capability of automatically transferring (exfiltrating) data, which aligns with BlackSoul's functionality of handling commands from its C2 server for executing commands and returning results, including file transfers.

Final Answer: C
