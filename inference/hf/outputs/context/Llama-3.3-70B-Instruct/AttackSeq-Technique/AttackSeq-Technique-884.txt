To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the 'Red October' campaign, also known as 'Rocra', which has been active for at least five years, targeting diplomatic and governmental agencies worldwide.
   - **Initial Access**: The attackers used spear phishing with documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The attackers created a multi-functional framework for intelligence gathering, resistant to C&C server takeover, with alternative communication channels for recovery access to infected machines. During lateral movement, a module was deployed to scan the local area network for hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 or accessible with admin credentials.
   - **Command and Control**: The C&C infrastructure involves a chain of proxy servers to hide the true command and control server, with over 60 domain names and several server hosting locations.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely employed to infect remote hosts during lateral movement in the local area network, after initial access and before establishing the sophisticated C&C infrastructure.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves gaining initial access through spear phishing and then moving laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that during lateral movement, the attackers deployed a module to scan the local area network for hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 or accessible with admin credentials from their password database.
   - This action indicates the exploitation of vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** was achieved through spear phishing, which is not the focus of the question.
   - The question focuses on the action taken **after** initial access and **before** the full establishment of the C&C infrastructure, specifically during lateral movement.
   - The report highlights the use of a module to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities (like MS08-067) or use admin credentials, which aligns with exploiting remote services to infect remote hosts.
   - **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services** is the technique that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system or network. This matches the description of the attackers' actions during lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
