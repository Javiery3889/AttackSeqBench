To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Darkhotel APT's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Targeting specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks.
     2. **Resource Development**: Compromising trusted network resources and possessing advanced offensive capabilities.
     3. **Initial Access**: Gaining access through malware posing as software updates or via P2P sharing sites.
     4. **Execution**: Deploying malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and using 0-day exploits.
     5. **Persistence**: Maintaining persistence through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
     6. **Credential Access**: Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services.
     7. **Collection**: Encrypting and storing gathered data in log files.
     8. **Command and Control**: Maintaining a web interface for victim management and encrypting victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Darkhotel APT used digital certificates to sign their backdoors (which is related to bypassing defenses) and involves encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.
   - The key elements here are the use of digital certificates for bypassing defenses and the subsequent actions involving data encryption and storage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors is not explicitly mentioned in the report but can be related to **Resource Development** and **Execution** tactics, where the APT demonstrates advanced capabilities, including undermining trust in Certificate Authorities.
   - The action of encrypting and storing gathered data in log files is directly mentioned under the **Collection** tactic.
   - Given the context, we are looking for a technique that would logically follow the use of signed backdoors (implying a method to maintain access or evade detection) and precede or be part of the data collection and encryption process.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** (A) is a technique for persistence and privilege escalation, not directly related to the use of digital certificates or the encryption/storage of data.
   - **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (B) is related to credential access, which is part of the APT's activities but does not directly involve encryption and storage of gathered data.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain** (C) involves compromising software updates or repositories, which is how the APT gains initial access but does not directly relate to the post-exploitation activities described.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** (D) involves techniques to hide malicious artifacts, which could include encrypting data to avoid detection. This technique aligns with the APT's actions after gaining access and collecting data, as it would be a logical step to hide the collected data (artifacts) from detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question hints at a post-exploitation technique that involves encryption and storage of data, which is part of the **Collection** tactic.
   - Given the context of using digital certificates (implied in the question) and the need to encrypt and store data, the most relevant technique would be one that involves hiding or protecting the collected data.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** (D) is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to the action of encrypting and storing gathered data in a way that avoids detection, fitting the sequence of actions described for the Darkhotel APT.

Final Answer: D
