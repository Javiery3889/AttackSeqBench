To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the activities of SideCopy APT, focusing on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in targeting government personnel in India.
   - Key points include the use of decoy documents, honeytraps, and malicious files (like LNK files) for initial access.
   - The group uses various malware and plugins for espionage, with a particular focus on credential harvesting, especially targeting the Kavach MFA app.
   - Techniques for persistence, defense evasion, and command and control are also mentioned.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Targeting government personnel with decoys and honeytraps.
   - **Initial Access**: Using malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and other executables.
   - **Execution**: Deploying RATs and plugins for credential stealing and keylogging.
   - **Persistence**: Using registry keys, VBScripts, and other methods.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Mimicking legitimate processes, using decoys.
   - **Credential Access**: Targeting Kavach MFA app with njRAT and GoLang-based plugins.
   - **Command and Control**: Delivering payloads through fake or compromised websites.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique most likely used after deploying GoLang-based file recon plugins and using Command and Control infrastructure to retrieve Kavach authentication databases.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifies the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for enumeration and the involvement of Command and Control infrastructure.
   - Given the context, the technique in question should relate to the exfiltration of data (Kavach authentication databases) from infected devices.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal - exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that this involves moving data from the infected device to the attackers.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the options provided:
     - **A: T1601-Modify System Image**: Not directly related to data exfiltration.
     - **B: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: Involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage, which could be a method but isn't directly implied by the use of GoLang-based plugins and C2 infrastructure for this specific action.
     - **C: T1566-Phishing**: Relates to obtaining data through phishing, not exfiltrating data after access is gained.
     - **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: Involves automatically exfiltrating data, which aligns with using plugins and C2 infrastructure for data extraction.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Given the context of using GoLang-based file recon plugins for enumeration and the focus on retrieving specific databases (Kavach authentication databases) through Command and Control infrastructure, the most appropriate technique for this action is automated exfiltration. This technique aligns with the use of specialized plugins and infrastructure for the purpose of extracting and transferring data from infected devices back to the attackers.

**Final Answer: D**
