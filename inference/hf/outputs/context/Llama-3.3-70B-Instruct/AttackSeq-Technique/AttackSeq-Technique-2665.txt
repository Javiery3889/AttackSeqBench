To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Execution involves a custom loader exploiting a side-loading vulnerability to load the Korplug variant.
   - Persistence is achieved through creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - Defense evasion techniques include control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis, and encryption.
   - The Korplug variant collects system information, files, and metadata, and exfiltrates data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that supports the campaign's ability to maintain communication if a primary server becomes unavailable, after Korplug communicates with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the need for a technique that allows the campaign to maintain communication if the primary server becomes unavailable. This implies a need for redundancy or an alternative method of communication.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves the use of alternative communication channels if the primary one is compromised or unavailable. It fits the requirement of maintaining communication in case of primary server unavailability.
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system time, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining communication with C&C servers if a primary server is down.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses, which could be part of maintaining communication but doesn't directly address the fallback in case of server unavailability.
   - **T1574.012-COR_PROFILER**: This is related to .NET profiling, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario of maintaining C&C communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for a technique that supports maintaining communication if a primary server becomes unavailable.
   - The technique must provide a means of fallback or alternative communication.
   - T1008-Fallback Channels directly addresses the need for an alternative communication method if the primary server is unavailable.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the one that aligns with the concept of having a backup plan for communication.

Final Answer: A
