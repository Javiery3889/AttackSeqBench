To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign with similarities to MuddyWater, targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros, which then execute the payload.
   - **Execution**: After execution, files are created in the ProgramData directory, including a .VBS script to execute a PowerShell script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Persistence**: The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The campaigns use obfuscation processes and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
   - **Discovery** and **Collection**: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots, sending this data to a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs after the backdoor collects machine information and screenshots to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves collecting data and then communicating with a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the CTI report relevant to the question is the backdoor's function of collecting machine information and screenshots and then sending this data to a C&C server.
   - This action implies a need for communication with an external service (the C&C server) to transmit the collected data.
   - Among the answer choices, we need to find the one that best matches the technique of communicating with external services for transmitting data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is not directly related to the backdoor's communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive, which does not match the scenario of sending collected data to a C&C server.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C&C server or to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the backdoor's action of sending collected data to a C&C server.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This involves transferring tools into a network, which is not directly related to the communication of collected data to a C&C server.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that matches the scenario described is communicating with a web service to send collected data to a C&C server.

**Final Answer: C**
