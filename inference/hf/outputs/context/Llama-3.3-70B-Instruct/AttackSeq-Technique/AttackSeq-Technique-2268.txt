To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a Cosmic Banker attack targeting Mexican banking institutions.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Identifying targets.
     2. **Initial Access**: Through a phishing email with a malicious attachment.
     3. **Execution**: Running a PowerShell script from the Internet.
     4. **Persistence**: Creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Using VMProtect packer for evasion.
     6. **Credential Access**: Stealing bank credentials and accessing Outlook info.
     7. **Collection**: Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Sending collected email accounts through a POST web request.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data after exfiltration.
   - The key elements here are the communication of the PowerShell script with domains for downloading malware and sending data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect, specifically how the PowerShell script interacts with domains for downloading malware and sending collected data.
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: Involves using an internal proxy to communicate with external domains, which could be relevant but is not directly mentioned in the report as a method used by the PowerShell script.
   - **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: Refers to modifying PowerShell profiles to establish persistence, which is not directly related to communicating with external domains for downloading malware or sending data.
   - **T1114-Email Collection**: Involves collecting email, which is part of the attack but does not directly relate to the communication method used by the PowerShell script to interact with domains.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for communication. Given that the report mentions the PowerShell script downloading files from the Internet and the malware sending collected data via a POST web request (which uses HTTP), this option seems most relevant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report highlights the use of a PowerShell script to download malware from the Internet and the use of a POST web request to send collected data.
   - The question specifically asks about the technique facilitating communication with domains for these purposes.
   - Given the emphasis on web requests (which use application layer protocols like HTTP), the most appropriate technique is related to using these protocols for communication.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely facilitated this communication is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: D
