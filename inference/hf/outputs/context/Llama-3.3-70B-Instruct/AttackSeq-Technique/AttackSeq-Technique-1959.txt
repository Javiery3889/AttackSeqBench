To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the StellarParticle campaign's tactics, including:
     1. **Persistence**: Using credential hopping, accounts with Delegated Administrator rights, and configuring malware (TrailBlazer for WMI persistence and GoldMax via a crontab entry) for persistence.
     2. **Defense Evasion**: Stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA, using renamed utilities, and renaming systems to match the victim's naming convention.
     3. **Credential Access**: Stealing web session cookies, using privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP, and compromising service principals.
     4. **Discovery**: Using AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather information from Active Directory and other systems.
     5. **Lateral Movement**: Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
     6. **Collection**: Accessing data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before achieving persistence by configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence, given that stolen credentials were used to persist via VPN access.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are:
     - A: T1036-Masquerading
     - B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks
     - C: T1133-External Remote Services
     - D: T1078-Valid Accounts

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - To configure TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence, the threat actor would first need to gain access to the system with sufficient privileges.
   - Given that stolen credentials were used for VPN access, it implies the threat actor had already obtained valid credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts) to access the network.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts** is directly related to using stolen or compromised credentials to access systems, which would be a precursor to configuring malware for persistence.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** could be relevant in the context of defense evasion but is not directly related to the initial step of gaining access to configure persistence.
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks** and **T1133-External Remote Services** might be part of the discovery or initial reconnaissance phase but are not directly linked to the action of configuring malware for persistence after gaining access via VPN.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actor used stolen credentials for VPN access, indicating they had valid accounts.
   - Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence requires access to the system, which would be facilitated by using valid accounts.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur before configuring TrailBlazer malware for persistence is using valid accounts to gain the necessary access.

Final Answer: D
