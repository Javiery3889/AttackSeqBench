To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Sednit group's attack sequence using the Zebrocy malware.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Initial contact through email with malicious attachments.
     2. **Initial Access**: Execution of VBA macros in documents to download and run the first-stage payload.
     3. **Execution**: The Delphi downloader gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server.
     4. **Persistence**: Malware persists through Windows registry entries.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Tactics include displaying bogus error messages and using encryption.
     6. **Discovery**: The malware performs reconnaissance on the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique used to secure communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server after the Delphi downloader has sent system information to the C&C server.
   - The relevant part of the sequence here involves the communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the Delphi backdoor uses AES encryption to protect its configuration data and communications with the C&C server. This directly points to the use of encryption for securing communication.
   - Looking at the answer choices:
     - **A: T1595-Active Scanning** is related to scanning for vulnerabilities, which is not relevant to securing communication.
     - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** refers to the use of encryption to protect communication, which aligns with the report's mention of AES encryption.
     - **C: T1071.004-DNS** involves using DNS for communication, which is not mentioned in the context of securing the Delphi backdoor's communication.
     - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** is about hijacking the execution flow of a process, which does not relate to securing communication between the backdoor and the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report specifies the use of AES encryption by the Delphi backdoor for its communications.
   - The question asks for the technique securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
   - The answer choice that directly relates to using encryption for securing communication is **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is the use of an encrypted channel for communication.

Final Answer: B
