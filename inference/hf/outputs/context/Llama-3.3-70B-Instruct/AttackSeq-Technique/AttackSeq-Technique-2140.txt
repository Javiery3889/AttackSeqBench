To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where initial access was gained through a malicious document (disguised as a Curriculum Vitae) that was likely sent as part of a phishing campaign.
   - The malware, once executed, made a POST request to the C2 (Command and Control) domain `judystevenson[.]info`.
   - The report mentions the use of NameCheap infrastructure, which has been associated with AridViper's activities in the past.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to establish communication with the initial C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info`, before additional C2 domains were identified.
   - The question implies we are looking for a technique related to how the malware or the attackers interacted with their C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the establishment of communication with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` via a POST request after the malware was executed.
   - We need to find an ATT&CK technique that aligns with this action of communicating with a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1001.001-Junk Data**: This involves sending irrelevant data to a system to affect its performance. It doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP addresses to gather information about the target network. While it could be part of reconnaissance, it doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given that the malware made a POST request (which is an application layer protocol, specifically HTTP) to the C2 domain, this seems highly relevant.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: While phishing was the initial vector used to deliver the malware, the question specifically asks about establishing communication with the C2 domain, not the initial infection vector.

Given the details, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique because it directly involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for communication with a C2 server, which aligns with the malware making a POST request to `judystevenson[.]info`.

**Final Answer: C**
