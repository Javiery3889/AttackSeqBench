To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Carbanak group, detailing their tactics from reconnaissance to exfiltration.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access (via spear-phishing)
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Lateral Movement
     10. Command and Control
     11. Exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromised numerous workstations, and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information.
   - The question focuses on the sequence of events post-lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After lateral movement, the attackers would likely engage in activities aimed at gathering more information or preparing for the final stages of the attack, such as exfiltration or further exploitation.
   - **T1562.006-Indicator Blocking** is related to defense evasion techniques, which might not directly follow lateral movement in the context of searching for critical information.
   - **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** involves collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the goal of searching for critical information after compromising workstations and servers.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** is a technique used for credential access, which could occur during or after lateral movement as attackers seek to gain more access.
   - **T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing** is a technique related to privilege escalation or lateral movement but is more specific to manipulating network traffic, which is not directly implied in the search for critical information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context that after moving laterally, the attackers were searching for critical information, the most relevant technique would be one that involves collecting or gathering data.
   - **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** directly relates to the action of collecting data from compromised systems, which would be a logical step after lateral movement and targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - While credential dumping (T1003) could also occur, the specific focus on searching for "critical information" suggests a broader data collection effort rather than solely focusing on credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after lateral movement, given the context, involves collecting data from information repositories.

Final Answer: B
