To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes APT28's tactics starting with **Initial Access** through spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using malicious URLs or documents to deliver malware.
   - **Execution** involves delivering exploit documents via spear-phishing emails to install malware.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics include leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities, using public code, and obtaining credentials to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access** is achieved through spear-phishing, directing victims to fake login pages, or using credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique APT28 likely used to move deeper into victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers and harvesting credentials.
   - The key detail here is the exploitation of internet-facing servers and the subsequent movement within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that APT28 has already gained initial access and harvested credentials, the next logical step would involve using these credentials or the exploited position to move laterally within the network.
   - The report mentions APT28's preference for using legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, which suggests they aim to blend in and avoid detection.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the technique that best aligns with moving deeper into a network after initial exploitation and credential harvesting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service that is available remotely, which could be a plausible next step after initial access, especially if the group is looking to move laterally within a network by exploiting services that are accessible remotely.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: While APT28 might use cloud services, there's no direct indication in the report that they specifically use cloud services to move deeper into victim networks after initial exploitation.
   - **C: T1653-Power Settings**: This technique is unrelated to the context of moving laterally within a network after exploiting internet-facing servers.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This involves techniques to hide artifacts, which is more related to defense evasion rather than lateral movement.

Given the context and the need to move deeper into the network after initial access and credential harvesting, **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** seems the most relevant technique. It aligns with the scenario of exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers to gain further access into the network.

**Final Answer: A**
