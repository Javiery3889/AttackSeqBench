To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving various MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - The adversary uses credential stuffing or password spraying to gain access.
     - They target remote services such as VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points.
     - The use of Cobalt Strike and other tools for various phases of the attack.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the MITRE ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the tactic of gaining access to remote services (VPN, Citrix, etc.) after credential stuffing.
   - The answer choices provided are:
     - A: T1078-Valid Accounts
     - B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules
     - C: T1200-Hardware Additions
     - D: T1082-System Information Discovery

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems or services. Given that the adversary used credential stuffing to gain access, this technique aligns with using obtained credentials (valid accounts) to access remote services.
   - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This sub-technique involves hiding malicious emails. It does not directly relate to accessing remote services via credential stuffing.
   - **T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or control. It does not relate to the use of credential stuffing for accessing remote services.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system. While discovery is part of the attack sequence, it does not directly facilitate access to remote services through credential stuffing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the technique used to gain access to remote services after credential stuffing.
   - Credential stuffing results in the adversary obtaining valid credentials.
   - Using these valid credentials to access remote services aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of using valid accounts.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the technique that involves using valid accounts to access systems or services.

Final Answer: A
