To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Lazarus group that starts with **Initial Access** through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - The sequence of tactics as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework mentioned in the report includes:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Defense Evasion
     5. Credential Access
     6. Discovery
     7. Lateral Movement
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used **before** the initial access through spear-phishing to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry.
   - The question is essentially asking about a precursor activity to the spear-phishing campaign that targeted specific individuals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question is about an activity preceding the initial access, we need to consider techniques that would facilitate targeting specific individuals.
   - **T1552.001 - Credentials In Files**: This involves obtaining credentials from files, which doesn't directly relate to targeting individuals before spear-phishing.
   - **T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the target, such as names, positions, or contact information, which could be used to craft targeted spear-phishing emails.
   - **T1595.001 - Scanning IP Blocks**: This involves scanning IP addresses to gather information about the target network, which might not directly contribute to targeting specific individuals.
   - **T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about using software deployment tools to deploy malware, which is not directly related to the preparation phase of targeting individuals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used **before** the initial access to prepare and target specific individuals.
   - The most relevant technique to targeting specific individuals within the defense industry before initiating a spear-phishing campaign would be gathering information about potential targets.
   - **T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information** is the technique that aligns with this requirement, as it involves collecting information that could be used to target specific individuals with tailored spear-phishing emails.

Final Answer: B
