To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents.
   - Upon execution, these documents download and decode files, leading to the execution of batch files.
   - The batch files download additional files, which are decoded to create a 'setup.cab' file.
   - The CAB file contains several files, including a DLL for UAC bypass, which is crucial for **Defense Evasion**.
   - The UAC bypass mechanism is used to prevent the User Account Control pop-up when moving files to the System32 folder, allowing the malware to execute without alerting the user.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up after executing a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file.
   - The focus is on the technique used for **Defense Evasion**, specifically to bypass UAC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the use of a UAC bypass module (a DLL file) to prevent UAC pop-ups, which directly relates to **Defense Evasion** tactics.
   - Among the answer choices, we need to find the one that aligns with bypassing or abusing elevation control mechanisms, such as UAC.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key aspect of the question, which is about bypassing UAC to execute malware without triggering a pop-up.
   - **Step 2**: Recall from the report that a UAC bypass module (DLL) was used for this purpose.
   - **Step 3**: Match this information with the provided answer choices to find the technique related to abusing or bypassing elevation control mechanisms.
   - **Step 4**: Recognize that **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** directly relates to techniques used to bypass UAC or other elevation control mechanisms, which aligns with the use of a UAC bypass DLL as described in the report.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the most appropriate answer is the one that deals with abusing elevation control mechanisms, such as UAC bypass.

Final Answer: B
