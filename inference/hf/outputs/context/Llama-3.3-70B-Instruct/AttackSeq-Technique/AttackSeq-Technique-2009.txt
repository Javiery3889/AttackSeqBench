To answer this question, let's break down the steps outlined in the CTI report and match them with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the question options.

1. **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering**: This is the initial step where adversaries gather information about potential targets. This step is described in the report as "Reconnaissance: Step 1."

2. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** reconnaissance but **before** the installation of BlackEnergy 3. 

Given the sequence of events:
- **Reconnaissance** (Step 1) is followed by the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (Step 4), which involves a social engineering attack where employees are prompted to enable macros when opening a file attached to a phishing email.

Let's evaluate the options:
- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which is not directly related to the initial steps of reconnaissance and the subsequent action of installing malware through phishing.
  
- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Given that the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (Step 4) was achieved through a social engineering attack involving phishing emails, this seems like a plausible step that occurred after reconnaissance but before the malware installation.

- **C: T1559.003-XPC Services**: This technique is related to using XPC services for lateral movement, which does not directly fit the sequence of events described as happening before the installation of BlackEnergy 3.

- **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by tricking a user into doing something, which aligns with the method used to install BlackEnergy 3 (through enabling macros in a phishing email). However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before BlackEnergy 3 was installed, and while user execution is part of the installation process, the specific technique of phishing (T1566) is what led to the user execution.

Given the sequence of events and the details provided, **B: T1566-Phishing** is the most likely technique to have occurred after reconnaissance and before the installation of BlackEnergy 3, as it directly relates to the method used to trick users into enabling macros, which then led to the installation of the malware.

Final Answer: B
