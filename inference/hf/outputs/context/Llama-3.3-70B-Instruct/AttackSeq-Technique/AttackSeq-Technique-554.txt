To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the MuddyWater attacks, which start with Initial Access using a PowerShell-based backdoor named POWERSTATS.
   - The attackers used GitHub to host their custom backdoors and utilized open-source tools for Defense Evasion, including Meterpreter, Mimikatz, and others.
   - The report mentions the use of compiled executables and scripts, indicating a focus on evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the attackers used open-source tools to evade defenses, specifically to facilitate communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect post-defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report highlights the use of GitHub for hosting backdoors and the utilization of various evasion techniques.
   - The question is about facilitating communication, which implies a need for Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the technique that best aligns with establishing or facilitating C2 communication using domains and proxy URLs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1205 - Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves manipulating network traffic to signal to the attacker that a compromised system is ready for further exploitation or to receive commands. While it's related to communication, it's more about signaling rather than the establishment of C2 channels.
   - **T1564.005 - Hidden File System**: This technique involves using a hidden file system to store data or tools, which doesn't directly relate to facilitating communication with compromised systems.
   - **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication. Given that the attackers used domains and proxy URLs, this technique aligns well with the need to communicate with compromised systems over the internet, potentially using common application layer protocols to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **T1548.004 - Elevated Execution with Prompt**: This technique is about gaining elevated execution privileges, which, while important for persistence and further exploitation, doesn't directly relate to the establishment of C2 communication channels.

Given the context of the question and the techniques described, **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to facilitating communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs, as it directly involves using protocols that can be used over the internet for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: C**
