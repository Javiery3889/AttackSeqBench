To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the BitterAPT group's activities, including their initial access methods such as distributing malware through fake applications and compromised websites.
   - Key points include the use of custom RAT (BitterRAT), distribution through compromised sites like gandharaart[.]org, and the use of phishing schemes.
   - The report also mentions the evolution of BitterRAT to include spying and stealing personal information capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC (Command and Control) servers.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of multiple CnC servers such as blitzchatlog.ddns.net and playupdateapp.serveblog.net after the initial malware distribution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the communication with compromised systems, which implies the need for a technique that allows for dynamic or flexible communication, possibly to evade detection or to manage a network of compromised devices efficiently.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the technique that best matches the requirement for facilitating communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate information or to receive commands. It doesn't directly relate to using multiple CnC servers for communication with compromised systems.
   - **B & C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves using dynamic DNS or other methods to make the resolution of CnC server addresses dynamic, allowing for more flexibility and evasion of detection. Given that the question mentions the use of multiple CnC servers (e.g., blitzchatlog.ddns.net, which uses a dynamic DNS service), this technique seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is an initial access technique and does not directly relate to the communication with compromised systems after the initial infection.

Given the information and the focus on communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers, the most plausible technique is related to dynamic resolution, which would allow the attackers to manage and communicate with compromised systems effectively.

**Final Answer: B**
