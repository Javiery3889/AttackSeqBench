To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that starts with **Initial Access** via a dropper that exploits CVE-2017-11882.
   - The exploitation method involves mapping a large OLE object in memory and dropping files using a PE (Portable Executable).
   - The dropper ensures **Persistence** by executing iassvcs.exe, which is reloaded with each executable or command line execution, utilizing a side-loading technique for **Defense Evasion**.
   - The report mentions the creation and loading of files such as iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll but does not explicitly state the technique used for their creation and loading in the context of the ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after the initial access to create and load files such as iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll for subsequent execution.
   - The question focuses on the actions taken after the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 and the decoding and execution of shellcode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the use of a dropper that drops files (including iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll) after exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
   - The technique in question involves creating and loading these files for execution, which is part of establishing persistence and possibly evading defenses.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** refers to the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While this could be relevant in some contexts for loading files, it's not directly related to the creation and loading of specific executable files like iassvcs.exe.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is about exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is relevant to the initial access vector (exploiting CVE-2017-11882) but not directly to the creation and loading of files post-exploitation.
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell** is a subset of T1059 and involves using PowerShell, which could be used for various tasks including loading files, but the report does not specifically mention PowerShell.
   - **T1543.001-Launch Agent** involves creating and loading a new agent (e.g., executable) on a system, which aligns with the creation and loading of files like iassvcs.exe for persistence and further malicious activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used after initial access to create and load specific files.
   - The report details the exploitation and the subsequent actions, including the creation and loading of files for persistence.
   - Given the focus on creating and loading new files (like iassvcs.exe) for execution, the most relevant technique from the provided options is **T1543.001-Launch Agent**, as it directly involves creating and loading a new agent (executable) on the system, which aligns with the actions described post-exploitation.

Final Answer: D
