To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes APT42's operations, starting with reconnaissance and initial access via spear phishing.
   - Key points include building trust with targets, using credential harvesting pages or malicious attachments, and bypassing MFA.
   - The group uses various techniques for execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance, followed by initial access through spear phishing, and then various post-compromise tactics.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before APT42 gained initial access, to complement their credential harvesting efforts.
   - The focus is on what happened before the spear phishing and MFA bypassing, in the context of preparing for or supporting these actions.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question hints at activities that would support or precede the initial access phase, particularly in relation to credential harvesting and the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - **T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**: This technique involves installing a root certificate on a compromised system, which could be used to intercept HTTPS traffic and aid in credential harvesting. However, it's more of a post-compromise tactic.
   - **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This involves developing capabilities, such as tools or malware, which could be used to support credential harvesting and other tactics. It fits the context of preparing for or complementing credential harvesting efforts.
   - **T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**: While social media could be used for reconnaissance or phishing, this option doesn't directly complement credential harvesting with lightweight tools and custom backdoors as closely as developing capabilities does.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This is more about the action taken after initial access, targeting other users within an organization, rather than preparing for initial access.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before initial access and supports credential harvesting.
   - Developing capabilities (T1587) is about creating or obtaining the tools and malware needed for operations, including those for credential harvesting and bypassing security measures like MFA.
   - This development would logically precede the actual use of these tools in operations like spear phishing and MFA bypassing.

**Final Answer**: B
