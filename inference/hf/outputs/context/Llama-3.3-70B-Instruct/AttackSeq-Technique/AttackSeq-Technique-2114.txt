To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the identification and tracking of malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure by Recorded Future's Insikt Group.
   - It mentions the detection of over 10,000 unique C2 servers in 2021 across various malware and tool families.
   - The report highlights the resiliency and stealth measures applied by C2 families like Cobalt Strike Team Servers and botnet families.
   - It notes that 25% of detected servers were not referenced in open sources, indicating a significant portion of C2 infrastructure remains undiscovered by public means.
   - The average 35-day lead time between detection and public reporting of C2 servers suggests a window of opportunity for threat actors to operate undetected.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence implied by the report involves:
     1. **Resource Development**: Threat actors acquire servers (through compromise or legitimate purchase).
     2. **Command and Control**: These servers are then used to configure malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after threat actors acquired servers and used them for configuring malicious C2 infrastructure.
   - The question essentially looks for a technique related to setting up or utilizing C2 infrastructure.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves sending malicious attachments to gain initial access, which doesn't directly relate to setting up C2 infrastructure after acquiring servers.
   - **T1588 - Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or expertise to support operations. While relevant to resource development, it's broader and not specifically about configuring C2 infrastructure.
   - **T1133 - External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services for C2 communications, which aligns with the concept of configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes after acquiring servers.
   - **T1098.007 - Additional Local or Domain Groups**: This involves adding accounts to local or domain groups to escalate privileges, which is more related to post-compromise activities within a network rather than setting up C2 infrastructure.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after acquiring servers for C2 purposes.
   - The correct answer should directly relate to utilizing or configuring these servers for C2.
   - **T1133 - External Remote Services** is the most relevant technique as it directly involves using external services (like the acquired servers) for C2 communications, fitting the scenario described.

**Final Answer: C**
