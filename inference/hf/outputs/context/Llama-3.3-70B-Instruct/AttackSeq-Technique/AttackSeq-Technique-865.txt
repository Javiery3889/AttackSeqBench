To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes GreyEnergy's activities, starting with **Reconnaissance** targeting energy companies and high-value targets.
   - **Initial Access** is achieved through spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers.
   - **Persistence** involves securely wiping malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include pushing selected modules to targets, partial encryption, and running modules fileless in memory.
   - **Credential Access** is gained using tools like Mimikatz and custom port scanners.
   - **Lateral Movement** involves deploying internal C&C proxies.
   - **Command and Control** is facilitated through these internal proxies to an external C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before deploying modular malware functionalities, after initial access via spearphishing and compromised web servers.
   - The question focuses on the sequence of events post-initial access and pre-deployment of modular malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial access methods (spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers) are used to gain entry into the system, the next logical step would involve establishing a foothold or preparing the environment for further exploitation.
   - **T1087.001-Local Account** (Answer Choice A) refers to using a local account to maintain access, which could be part of the process but doesn't directly relate to preparing for modular malware deployment.
   - **T1587-Develop Capabilities** (Answer Choice B) involves developing capabilities, which could include creating or preparing the modular malware functionalities for deployment. This seems like a plausible step before deploying malware.
   - **T1585.003-Cloud Accounts** (Answer Choice C) is about compromising cloud accounts, which is not directly mentioned in the context of GreyEnergy's initial activities post-access.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** (Answer Choice D) refers to exploiting remote services, which could be part of the initial access or lateral movement but doesn't directly address the preparation for deploying modular malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before deploying modular malware functionalities.
   - The CTI report highlights GreyEnergy's use of spearphishing and web server compromise for initial access.
   - Developing capabilities (including preparing modular malware) seems a necessary step before deployment.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves developing or preparing these capabilities before deploying them.

Final Answer: B
