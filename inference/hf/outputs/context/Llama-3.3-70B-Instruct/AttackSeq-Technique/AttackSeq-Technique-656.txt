To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Gallmaker delivered malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails, exploiting the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands in memory.
     2. **Defense Evasion**: They used living off the land (LotL) tactics, publicly available hack tools, and deleted tools after use to avoid detection.
     3. **Command and Control**: Used three primary IP addresses for C&C infrastructure.
     4. **Exfiltration**: Likely used the WinZip console to archive data for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves exploiting the DDE protocol and then another technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After exploiting the DDE protocol for initial access, the next logical step would involve establishing a means to interact with the compromised system.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy** (A) might be used later in the attack for communication, but it's not directly related to the immediate post-exploitation actions.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** (B) is a technique that could be used after initial access to execute commands on the system, which aligns with the use of DDE to execute commands in memory and the subsequent need to interact with the system.
   - **T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium** (C) is not directly relevant to the immediate post-exploitation phase described.
   - **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange** (D) is what was used for initial access, not what happened after.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred after the initial exploitation via DDE.
   - Given that the DDE protocol was used to execute commands in memory, the next logical step would be to use a command and scripting interpreter to further interact with the system.
   - This would allow the attackers to execute more commands, move laterally, or prepare for exfiltration, aligning with the tactics of establishing command and control.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after exploiting the DDE protocol for initial access is using a command and scripting interpreter.

Final Answer: B
