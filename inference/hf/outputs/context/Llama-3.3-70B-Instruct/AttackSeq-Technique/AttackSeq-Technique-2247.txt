To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Iranian APT group MuddyWater.
   - The initial access vector involves exploiting CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office vulnerability, through decoy documents.
   - A second vector involves communication with compromised C2 (Command and Control) servers to download files infected with macros.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2017-0199 via decoy documents.
   - Next Step: Communication with compromised C2 servers to download malicious files (macros).

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when MuddyWater initiated communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code in the second stage of attacks.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the transfer of malicious code from a compromised server after initial access.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves communicating with a C2 server, which could be relevant but is more about the nature of the communication rather than the transfer of tools or code itself.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which is not directly related to the communication with compromised servers for code transfer.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into a compromised system, which aligns with the description of downloading files infected with macros from compromised C2 servers.
   - **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique is about exfiltrating data while avoiding detection by limiting the size of the data transfers, which does not directly relate to the transfer of malicious code for the next stage of the attack.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access is achieved through exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
   - The next step involves communication with compromised servers, not for the initial exploit, but for downloading malicious files (macros), which suggests the transfer of tools or code into the compromised system.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for transferring malicious code or tools into a system after initial access is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C**
