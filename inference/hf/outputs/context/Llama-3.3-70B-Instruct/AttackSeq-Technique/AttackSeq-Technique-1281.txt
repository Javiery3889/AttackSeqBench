To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Tropic Trooper, starting with **Initial Access** through exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - After gaining access, the attackers downloaded and installed an MSI package, which included executing a command to install the package silently.
   - The report then details **Persistence** mechanisms, including the use of an encrypted configuration file and connection to C&C servers via SSL.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques involved DLL hijacking to avoid antivirus detection.
   - **Command and Control** involved the use of SSL to connect to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment, following the initial access via Microsoft Office exploits.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the "execution of the backdoor's installer" and the involvement of "users' action or interaction."
   - Looking at the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices:
     - **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This involves using encryption to hide command and control communications, which doesn't directly relate to the execution of the installer based on user interaction.
     - **T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This is not directly relevant to the scenario described, as it involves creating a fork of a process to execute malicious code, which is not the focus of the question.
     - **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code in existing cloud services without deploying a server, which doesn't fit the context of the backdoor installer execution on a compromised system.
     - **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by tricking a user into running it, either by social engineering or by exploiting vulnerabilities that require user interaction.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraging users' action or interaction.
   - The CTI report mentions the initial access through exploits in Microsoft Office, which implies user interaction (e.g., opening a malicious document).
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with the scenario of leveraging user interaction to execute the backdoor's installer is **T1204-User Execution**.
   - This technique directly involves user interaction to execute malicious code, which fits the context of the attack sequence described.

Final Answer: D
