To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the BlueBravo group.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Resource Development**: Using compromised infrastructure, known malware, and third-party services for C2.
     2. **Initial Access**: Delivering malware through spearphishing emails and compromised domains.
     3. **Execution**: Malware acts as loaders with basic C2 functionality and employs anti-analysis techniques.
     4. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through copying malicious files and creating registry run keys.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Employing various evasion techniques including obfuscation, masquerading, and impairing defenses.
     6. **Discovery**: Gathering victim system information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by BlueBravo for bidirectional communication with their C2 servers using HTTPS protocol encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding, after gathering victim system information.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves communication with C2 servers, which implies a technique related to command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that BlueBravo uses known malware with basic C2 functionality and employs third-party services for C2, indicating they use various methods for communicating with their C2 servers.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of HTTPS protocol with RC4 and Base64 encoding for bidirectional communication, which suggests a technique focused on application layer protocol use for C2 communication.
   - Evaluating the answer choices:
     - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This involves using multiple proxies to obscure the destination of C2 traffic, which doesn't directly relate to the specifics of the protocol and encryption mentioned.
     - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C2 communication. Given that HTTPS (a secure form of HTTP) is mentioned, along with encryption methods, this seems highly relevant.
     - **C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**: This involves using AppCert DLLs for defense evasion, which doesn't directly relate to C2 communication protocols.
     - **D: T1106-Native API**: This involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which doesn't directly relate to the specifics of network communication protocols like HTTPS.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used for bidirectional communication with C2 servers over HTTPS with specific encryption methods.
   - The report highlights BlueBravo's use of various C2 methods, including the misuse of legitimate internet services, which could encompass using standard application layer protocols for C2.
   - Given the specifics of the question (use of HTTPS with RC4 and Base64 encoding), the most relevant ATT&CK technique is related to using application layer protocols for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with the information provided and the context of C2 communication using HTTPS is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: B
