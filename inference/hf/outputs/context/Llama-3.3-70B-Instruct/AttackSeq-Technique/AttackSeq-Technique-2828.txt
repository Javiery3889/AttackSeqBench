To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a malware campaign attributed to ReconHellcat, delivering a remote access Trojan (RAT) named BlackSoul.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing email delivering a CAB archive.
     2. **Execution**: Malicious loader uses obfuscation techniques and retrieves files from C2 infrastructure hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques.
     4. **Credential Access**: The DLL searches for browser data and decodes C2 URLs.
     5. **Collection**: BlackSoul is capable of file transfers, running arbitrary commands, and handling commands from its C2 server.
     6. **Exfiltration**: BlackSoul can exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service after using file transfers and executing arbitrary commands for data gathering.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves using the C2 infrastructure for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the use of Cloudflare Workers for C2 infrastructure, which implies web service usage for command and control.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** refers to collecting data from the local system, which doesn't directly relate to communicating with C2 infrastructure.
   - **T1102-Web Service** involves using web services for command and control, which aligns with using Cloudflare Workers for C2 communication.
   - **T1547.008-LSASS Driver** is related to credential access techniques, not directly relevant to C2 communication over web services.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** refers to using non-standard protocols for C2 communication, which doesn't specifically match the use of web services like Cloudflare Workers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used for communication with the C2 infrastructure after initial data gathering and command execution.
   - The use of Cloudflare Workers for hosting C2 infrastructure indicates a reliance on web services for command and control communication.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for this scenario is the one related to using web services for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
