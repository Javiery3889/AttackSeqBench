To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gholee malware campaign, which starts with an initial access attempt via a spear phishing attack using a malicious Excel file.
   - Upon execution, the malicious Excel file uses Macro code that concatenates ASCII character codes to create a PE file, which is then executed.
   - The malware establishes command and control by communicating with a specific IP address over SSL.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing with a malicious Excel file.
   - Execution: Macro code execution leading to the creation and execution of a PE file.
   - Command and Control: Communication with a Kuwait-based IP address.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique used by the Gholee malware to hide its activities after creating and executing the malicious PE file, specifically in relation to evading detection by debuggers and sandboxes.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the use of concatenated ASCII character codes to create a PE file. This suggests an attempt to obfuscate the code, making it harder for security tools and analysts to understand the malware's intent and behavior.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** refers to the malware's attempt to hide its code or data, making it difficult for defenders to analyze. This technique aligns with the use of ASCII character codes to avoid detection.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** involves the use of application layer protocols for communication, which is relevant to the Command and Control phase but not directly related to hiding activities from debuggers and sandboxes.
   - **T1564.009-Resource Forking** is not directly mentioned or implied in the provided CTI report.
   - **T1610-Deploy Container** is not relevant to the described behavior of hiding activities through code obfuscation.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Gholee malware uses a sophisticated method to create a PE file by concatenating ASCII character codes, which is a form of code obfuscation.
   - This method is intended to evade detection and make analysis more difficult, fitting the description of obfuscating files or information.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the method of hiding the malware's activities through code obfuscation as described.

**Final Answer: A**
