To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes various module groups used by the attackers, including Persistence, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration.
   - The Persistence module is used to plant a backdoor in popular applications.
   - Credential Access involves stealing credentials from various applications and resources.
   - Lateral Movement is about scanning and infecting other hosts on the network.
   - Exfiltration involves transferring collected data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs during victim network discovery in the reconnaissance phase when attackers use modules like 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to collect system information.
   - The question specifically mentions the collection of system information, including browser history and external IP addresses, before deploying persistence modules.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not directly mention the 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' modules, but it discusses the collection of various types of information, which aligns with reconnaissance activities.
   - The question focuses on the reconnaissance phase, specifically on gathering information about the victim's network.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the one that best matches the activity of gathering network information during the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies** (A) involves exploiting trust relationships within a network, which doesn't directly relate to gathering general network information.
   - **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller** (B) is about creating a fake domain controller, which is more related to manipulating network infrastructure than gathering information.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** (C) refers to automatically exfiltrating data, which is not about gathering network information but rather about transferring data out of the network.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** (D) directly involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase and the use of modules to collect system and network information.

Given the focus on collecting system information (like browser history and external IP addresses) before deploying persistence modules, the most relevant ATT&CK technique during the reconnaissance phase for victim network discovery is gathering information about the victim's network.

**Final Answer: D**
