To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where initial access is gained through a malicious document (disguised as a Curriculum Vitae) that, when executed, makes a POST request to a C2 (Command and Control) domain `judystevenson[.]info`.
   - The key points here are the use of a malicious document for initial access and the communication with a C2 domain.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains after the malware made a POST request to the C2 domain.
   - The focus is on the technique used for transferring tools or payloads after the initial communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the malware making a POST request to a C2 domain, which implies that the malware is communicating with the command and control server.
   - The question is about what happens after this communication is established, specifically how additional tools or payloads are transferred to facilitate further communication with multiple C2 domains.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols for communication, which doesn't directly relate to transferring tools or payloads after establishing C2 communication.
     - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This involves obtaining access to a domain controller, which is not directly relevant to transferring tools or payloads to communicate with C2 domains.
     - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or payloads into a compromised system, which aligns with the scenario of transferring additional tools or payloads after initial C2 communication.
     - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is about tricking users into revealing sensitive information, which is how the initial access was gained but not how additional tools or payloads would be transferred after the malware has already communicated with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has already gained initial access and communicated with a C2 domain.
   - The question is about the transfer of additional tools or payloads to facilitate further communication with multiple C2 domains.
   - The most relevant technique for this action, after the initial communication with the C2 server, is transferring tools or payloads into the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely facilitated this action is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

Final Answer: C
