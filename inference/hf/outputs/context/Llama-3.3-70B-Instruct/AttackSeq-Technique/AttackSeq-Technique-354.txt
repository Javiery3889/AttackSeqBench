To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses various tactics used by the threat actors involved in the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, including Reconnaissance, Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, and others.
   - Key points relevant to the question include the use of Defense Evasion techniques like Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1553) to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the threat actors evaded defenses, specifically to gather internal system information.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are related to discovering or interacting with system components or services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the threat actors have already evaded defenses using techniques like Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls, the next logical step would be to gather information about the internal system to further their objectives.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** involves gathering information about the running processes on a system, which could be crucial for understanding the system's current state, identifying potential targets, or finding processes to masquerade as.
   - **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking** is more about taking control of existing sessions rather than gathering information.
   - **T1003.003-NTDS** refers to a specific method of credential dumping from the NTDS database, which, while useful, is more focused on credential access than general system information gathering.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** involves discovering remote systems and services, which could be relevant but is broader and not as directly related to gathering detailed internal system information as process discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors have successfully evaded defenses, indicating they are inside the network and looking to gather more information.
   - The goal is to gather internal system information, which suggests they need detailed insights into the system's current state.
   - Among the options, **T1057-Process Discovery** is the most directly related to gathering detailed information about the system's running processes, which would be essential for further operations like identifying targets, avoiding detection, or preparing for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after evading defenses, given the need to gather internal system information, is **T1057-Process Discovery**.

Final Answer: B
