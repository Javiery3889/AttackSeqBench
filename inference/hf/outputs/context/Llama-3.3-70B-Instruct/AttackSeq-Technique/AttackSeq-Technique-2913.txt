To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions that APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - The attack sequence in order of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Compromising the network and gaining access.
     2. **Execution**: Deploying backdoors (including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS).
     3. **Persistence**: Installing RoyalDNS persistently.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Evading policy settings using RoyalCLI.
     5. **Credential Access**: Using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     6. **Collection**: Exporting data from various sources.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated obtaining domain administrator credentials after evading policy settings using the RoyalCLI backdoor.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves evading defenses and then obtaining credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report directly mentions using Mimikatz for obtaining domain administrator credentials, which falls under **Credential Access**.
   - The question specifies the action of evading policy settings (Defense Evasion) and then obtaining credentials.
   - We need to find the ATT&CK technique that aligns with obtaining domain administrator credentials after evading defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the technique used for obtaining credentials. The report mentions Mimikatz, which is known for extracting plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory.
   - **Step 2**: Match this with the provided answer choices to find the best fit.
     - A: **T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates** involves stealing certificates, which is not directly related to using Mimikatz for credential extraction.
     - B: **T1078-Valid Accounts** could be a result of the credential access but doesn't specify the method of obtaining those credentials.
     - C: **T1556.005-Reversible Encryption** refers to using reversible encryption to obtain credentials, which aligns with the capability of Mimikatz to extract credentials from memory.
     - D: **T1053.006-Systemd Timers** is related to scheduled tasks and not directly related to credential extraction.

Given the information and focusing on the method used (Mimikatz) for obtaining domain administrator credentials, the most relevant technique after evading policy settings would be related to extracting credentials, which aligns with reversible encryption methods used by tools like Mimikatz.

**Final Answer: C**
