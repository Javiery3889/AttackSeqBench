To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the SideWinder APT group.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps.
     2. **Execution**: The callCam app executes in the background to collect sensitive information.
     3. **Privilege Escalation**: Using device rooting or accessibility permissions.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employing obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
     5. **Discovery**: Collecting extensive information from compromised devices.
     6. **Collection**: Collecting various types of data.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Encrypting the collected data and exfiltrating it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the data exfiltration process, after the callCam app collected and encrypted sensitive information.
   - The relevant part of the sequence here involves the steps right before exfiltration, focusing on how the data is prepared for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the collection and encryption of sensitive information, which aligns with the **Collection** phase in the report.
   - Before exfiltration, the report mentions that the callCam app "encrypted the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, verified data integrity with SHA256, and customized the encoding routine."
   - The key detail here is the "customized the encoding routine" part, which suggests an additional step of preparing the data for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling** is not directly related to the preparation of data for exfiltration in the context provided.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** is part of the discovery phase and not directly related to the preparation of data for exfiltration.
   - **T1525-Implant Internal Image** does not directly relate to the process of preparing collected data for exfiltration.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding** involves encoding data to make it less detectable, which aligns with customizing the encoding routine before exfiltration.

Given the details in the report and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the data exfiltration process involves encoding the data to prepare it for exfiltration, which matches **T1132-Data Encoding**.

**Final Answer: D**
