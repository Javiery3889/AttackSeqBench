To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an initial access tactic through a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism for NoxPlayer.
   - The attack involves the execution of a malicious application (UpdatePackageSilence.exe) that decrypts and loads a DLL into memory, initiating fileless PE loads.
   - The application alters its execution flow to hide the dialog and avoid detection.
   - The malware extracts C&C information and saves it to a file.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Supply chain attack through BigNox's update mechanism.
   - Execution: Malicious application execution with fileless PE loads.
   - Command and Control: Extraction of C&C information.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gaining initial access and before extracting C&C information to evade detection.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context, the technique must be related to evading detection after the initial access and before the C&C information extraction.
   - **T1497.001-System Checks**: This involves checking the system for the presence of security tools or other indicators that might suggest the system is being monitored. While possible, the report does not directly indicate system checks as a method to evade detection in this specific sequence.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. The report mentions the application's execution flow is altered to hide the dialog and avoid showing on the Windows Taskbar, which aligns with hiding artifacts.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This is the initial access method described, not a technique used after gaining access to evade detection.
   - **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This involves using voice phishing to trick victims, which is not relevant to the post-initial access evasion techniques described in the report.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique used after initial access and before C&C information extraction to evade detection.
   - The report details efforts to hide the application's presence (e.g., hiding the dialog, avoiding the Taskbar), which is consistent with hiding artifacts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique used to evade detection, given the context provided, is hiding artifacts.

**Final Answer: B**
