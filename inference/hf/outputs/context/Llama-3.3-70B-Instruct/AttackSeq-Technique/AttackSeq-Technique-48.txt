To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents that deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The initial access is achieved through phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded VBS macros.
   - After initial access, a PowerShell script is executed, which operates in memory and downloads payloads without writing to the disk.
   - The script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads, including GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Initial Access**: Execution of VBS macros in the Word documents.
   - **Defense Evasion**: PowerShell script operates in memory, downloads payloads without saving to disk.
   - **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers to download payloads.
   - **Impact**: Execution of GandCrab and Ursnif malware.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the PowerShell script executed payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, after achieving initial access through phishing emails.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key here is understanding what happens after the initial access (phishing emails with malicious Word documents) and before the execution of the payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab malware).
   - The report mentions that after the initial access, a PowerShell script is executed. This script is crucial as it leads to the execution of the malware.
   - The ATT&CK technique that involves executing a command or script via an interpreter (in this case, PowerShell) is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**. This technique fits the sequence as it is the mechanism by which the PowerShell script (which then downloads and executes the malware) is executed after the initial access.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Initial access is gained through phishing emails.
   - The malicious Word document's macro executes a PowerShell script.
   - The PowerShell script then downloads and executes the malware (Ursnif and GandCrab).
   - The technique that directly precedes the execution of the malware and involves the execution of the PowerShell script is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: D**
