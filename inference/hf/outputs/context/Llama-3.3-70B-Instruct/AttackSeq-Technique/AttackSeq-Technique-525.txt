To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the INOCNATION campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Utilized a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client.
     2. **Execution**: Executed a malicious DLL payload with anti-behavioral analysis techniques.
     3. **Persistence**: Set up a persistence mechanism by creating a registry key.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employed several techniques including XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and a mangled MZ header.
   - The "Others" section provides additional context about the malware's capabilities, including receiving commands from its C2 server and the ability to uninstall itself.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when INOCNATION's malware established secure communications with the C2 server while adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
   - The key elements here are the establishment of secure communications with the C2 server and the addition of an extra layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the malware's ability to receive commands from its C2 server, which implies communication with the C2 server.
   - The question specifically asks about establishing secure communications with an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic. This points towards a technique that involves encrypting communication channels.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This involves using multiple proxies to obscure the source of traffic, which doesn't directly relate to encrypting the communication channel itself.
     - **B: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This involves using RDP for remote access, which is not directly related to the encryption of C2 communications.
     - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 communications, which aligns with the question's description of adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
     - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is about evading detection in virtualized or sandbox environments, which is not directly related to encrypting C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the establishment of secure communications with the C2 server and the addition of an extra layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.
   - The report highlights the malware's sophisticated evasion techniques, including communication with a C2 server.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique to the scenario described in the question is the one that involves encrypting the communication channel to protect C2 communications.
   - **Final Answer: C**
