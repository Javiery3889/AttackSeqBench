To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the initial access tactics used by the Dridex malware, involving spambots sending malicious documents that execute macros to download and execute the Dridex payload.
   - Execution tactics involve the loader using anti-debug techniques and the payload being heavily obfuscated.
   - Defense evasion tactics include the use of anti-debug techniques and obfuscation to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by Dridex to communicate data (such as computer name and botnet ID number) with its Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests after employing evasion techniques.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of encrypted POST requests, which implies a method of communication over a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the question focuses on communication with C2 servers via encrypted POST requests, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that best matches this description.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application-layer protocols (such as HTTP, FTP, etc.) for communication. Given that the question mentions encrypted POST requests, which are typically used in HTTP/S communication, this technique seems highly relevant.
   - **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This is more related to evading debuggers, which doesn't directly relate to communicating with C2 servers.
   - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: While encoding could be part of the communication process, the question specifically mentions encrypted POST requests, which suggests a standard method of secure communication rather than non-standard encoding.
   - **T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique is about determining the physical location of a device, which doesn't directly relate to the communication method with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used for communicating with C2 servers via encrypted POST requests.
   - Encrypted POST requests typically use HTTPS, an application-layer protocol.
   - Therefore, the most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action is the use of an application-layer protocol for C2 communication.
   - **Final Answer: A**
