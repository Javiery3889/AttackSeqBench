To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware was used.
   - **Initial Access** was gained through spearphishing emails with the spyware disguised as a PDF document.
   - After initial access, the report mentions the identification of several Command and Control (C&C) servers, indicating that the spyware had already been installed and was communicating back to these servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred **after** the spyware gained initial access.
   - The initial access method described is through a spearphishing email with a disguised executable file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware or tools to look like legitimate files or processes. Given that the spyware was disguised as a PDF document, this could be a plausible next step after initial access, as the malware might continue to masquerade as a legitimate process to avoid detection.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for initial access, not after gaining access.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malware into a legitimate process, which could be a step after initial access to maintain persistence or evade detection.
   - **T1647-Plist File Modification**: This technique is specific to modifying Plist files on macOS systems to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the initial access method described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred **after** initial access.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is the method of initial access, so it's not the answer.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** could be relevant as the malware might continue to disguise itself after initial access.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** is a technique that could be used after initial access to inject the spyware into a legitimate process, making it a strong candidate.
   - **T1647-Plist File Modification** seems less relevant given the context does not specify macOS or the modification of Plist files.

Given the context that the spyware has already gained initial access and is likely looking to establish a foothold within the system, **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** seems like a plausible next step for maintaining persistence and evading detection, which aligns with the goals of spyware.

**Final Answer: C**
