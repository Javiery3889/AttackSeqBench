To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Sednit group, starting with an initial access phase via spearphishing.
   - The execution phase involves the deployment of various malware components, including downloaders and a backdoor, which are used for command execution, system information gathering, and network scanning.
   - Persistence is achieved through COM object hijacking.
   - The group uses defense evasion techniques, such as deleting files and killing processes.
   - Credential access is gained through dumpers targeting browsers and email clients.
   - Discovery involves gathering system and environment information.
   - Command and control communication uses common ports and encryption.
   - Exfiltration involves preparing and sending data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Sednit group's malware scanned for files and staged data for exfiltration but before sending the data to the C&C server.
   - The key actions mentioned are scanning for files, staging data, and then sending the data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after gaining access and executing their tools, the Sednit group engaged in various activities, including gathering system information, network scanning, and executing system commands.
   - The specific action of scanning for files matching specific extensions and staging data for exfiltration is closely related to the exfiltration phase, where data are prepared and sent to the C&C server.
   - Before sending the data, the group would likely want to ensure that their tracks are covered to avoid detection, which aligns with defense evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** (A) is related to capturing screenshots, which doesn't directly fit the context of preparing to send data after scanning and staging.
   - **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** (B) involves capturing input from web portals, which is not directly related to the actions described.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal** (C) involves removing indicators of compromise, which could include deleting files or covering tracks after data staging but before exfiltration, fitting the defense evasion category.
   - **T1599-Network Boundary Bridging** (D) is not directly related to the actions of scanning, staging, and preparing to exfiltrate data.

Given the context of the Sednit group's actions and the need to cover their tracks before exfiltrating data, the most plausible technique that occurred after scanning and staging data but before sending it to the C&C server is related to defense evasion, specifically removing indicators of compromise.

**Final Answer: C**
