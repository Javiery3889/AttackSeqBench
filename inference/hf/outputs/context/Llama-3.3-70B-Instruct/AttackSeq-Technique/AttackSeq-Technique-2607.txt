To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence of the NanHaiShu malware, which includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments that use VBA macros to execute a JScript file.
     2. **Execution**: The macro decodes and runs, writing and executing JScript, and sets up persistence.
     3. **Persistence**: Modifies the registry for autostart.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Uses base64 encoding and obfuscation.
     5. **Discovery**: Gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Can receive and execute additional scripts for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique most likely employed to establish communication with the C&C servers before the discovery activities, specifically mentioning the initial resolution to IP addresses hosted in the United States and later switching to a Chinese IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the change in IP addresses for the C&C servers, which suggests a method to dynamically resolve or change the communication channel.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** refers to the technique of dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses to establish command and control (C2) communications. This can involve using DNS, APIs, or other methods to resolve the location of the C2 server, which can change over time for evasion purposes.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** is about deobfuscating or decoding files or information that is encoded or obfuscated, which is relevant to the malware's use of base64 encoding but not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** involves capturing login credentials or other sensitive information via a web portal, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the initial and subsequent changes in the IP addresses of the C&C servers, indicating a need for dynamic resolution to maintain communication.
   - Given the context, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is the most relevant technique for establishing and maintaining communication with C&C servers that change IP addresses.
   - Although there are two identical options (A and B) labeled as T1568-Dynamic Resolution, the correct answer is clearly aligned with this technique based on the description provided.

Final Answer: A
