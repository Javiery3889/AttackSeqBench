To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gamaredon group's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing with malicious attachments.
     2. **Execution**: Using scripting, rundll32, and CreateProcess.
     3. **Persistence**: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation, modifying registry keys, code signing, and deobfuscation.
     5. **Discovery**: Automatically listing interesting files (like Office documents) for future exfiltration.
     6. **Lateral Movement**: Injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macro.
     7. **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and HTTPS.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Automatically uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after the discovery phase to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.
   - The discovery phase involves the backdoor automatically listing interesting files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After the discovery phase, where interesting files are listed, the next logical step would involve collecting these files.
   - **T1596.002-WHOIS**: This technique involves collecting information about domain registrations, which doesn't directly relate to gathering files from the local system.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This involves undermining trust mechanisms, which could be part of defense evasion but doesn't directly relate to collecting files.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data, which aligns with the action of gathering sensitive documents after they have been identified.
   - **T1213.001-Confluence**: This technique doesn't directly relate to the context provided, as it involves exploiting a specific vulnerability in Confluence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after the discovery phase to gather sensitive documents.
   - The discovery phase, as described, involves listing interesting files, which implies that the next step would be to collect these files.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection** is the technique that directly involves collecting data automatically, which fits the context of gathering sensitive documents after they have been identified during the discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after listing interesting files would involve automatically collecting these files.

Final Answer: C
