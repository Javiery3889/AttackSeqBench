To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions that the initial access vector includes spear-phishing emails and the exploitation of MS Office documents using CVE-2014-1761 to spread BlackEnergy malware.
   - The report highlights the use of BlackEnergy for various malicious activities and mentions its evolution, including the use of rootkit techniques in its version 2.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of MS Office documents (CVE-2014-1761) and spear-phishing.
   - The report does not explicitly detail the steps post-initial access in a sequential manner but mentions the malware's capabilities and its use in targeted attacks.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after exploiting MS Office documents to allow the BlackEnergy malware to bypass standard detection methods.
   - The question focuses on the technique used post-initial access to evade detection.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware needs to bypass standard detection methods, we are looking for a technique that involves evasion or concealment.
   - **T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This involves using RDP for lateral movement or other malicious activities, not directly related to evading detection by bypassing standard detection methods.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data or files difficult to detect by hiding or disguising them, which aligns with the goal of bypassing standard detection methods.
   - **T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying a container to execute applications without persisting data on the host, which could be related to evasion but is more about persistence and execution rather than directly bypassing detection.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This is an initial access technique and does not relate to post-exploitation evasion techniques.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically asks for a technique that helps the malware bypass standard detection methods after initial access.
   - The exploitation of MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761 is the initial access vector.
   - Among the given options, **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** is the most relevant technique for evading detection, as it directly relates to making files or information difficult to detect, which would be necessary for the malware to operate undetected after initial access.

**Final Answer: B**
