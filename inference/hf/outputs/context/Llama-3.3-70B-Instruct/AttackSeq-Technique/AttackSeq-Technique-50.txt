To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - The initial access is achieved through these phishing emails.
   - Upon opening the document, a VBS macro executes, calling a PowerShell script that downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - The PowerShell script operates in memory, using the .Net Webclient class to download payloads without writing them to disk.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are related to different methods of accessing or transferring tools within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to direct traffic between systems. While it could be related to communicating with C2 servers, it's not directly implied in the report as a necessary step before the PowerShell script's communication.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems. The report does not specifically mention the use of valid accounts as a precursor to the PowerShell script's actions.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into a network. Given that the PowerShell script downloads and executes malware (Ursnif and GandCrab), this technique seems directly relevant to the actions described in the report. However, the question asks what happened before the script communicated with C2 servers, which implies we are looking for an action that precedes the tool transfer.
   - **T1027.003-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. The report does not mention steganography as a method used in the campaign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report outlines a sequence where a phishing email leads to the execution of a VBS macro, which then executes a PowerShell script. This script downloads malware without writing to disk.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the PowerShell script communicated with C2 servers to download payloads. Given the context, the most relevant technique from the provided choices that directly precedes the communication and download (ingress tool transfer) would be related to how the initial script or tool (in this case, the PowerShell script) was executed or transferred into the system.
   - However, the provided choices and the context of the question suggest looking for a technique that enables or precedes the communication and tool transfer. Since the PowerShell script's execution is a result of the initial access vector (phishing email with a malicious Word document), and considering the choices provided, **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** seems to be the closest in the context of downloading and executing tools (malware in this case). But, it's essential to note that the question's phrasing implies looking for a step before the tool transfer, which might not be directly answered by the choices given the context of the report.
   - Given the direct information from the report and the question's context, the closest match based on the sequence of events (initial access leading to execution and then communication for further payload download) would actually involve the execution of the initial payload (the VBS macro and then the PowerShell script) which is a form of tool transfer but the question seems to ask for what happens before the script downloads additional payloads.

**Final Answer: C**
