To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence by Volatile Cedar, starting with Reconnaissance, followed by Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control.
   - Key points include the use of a web shell for initial access, the Explosive Trojan's structure (main executable and DLL), its dynamic loading and unloading of the DLL, and the use of keylogging for credential access.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Explosive Trojan dynamically unloaded the Explosive DLL and before leveraging keylogging capabilities.
   - This implies we are looking for an action that happens after the Execution phase (specifically, after the DLL is unloaded) but before the Credential Access phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (A)**: This technique involves using multiple communication channels to hide or obscure command and control traffic. While it could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of unloading the DLL and then using keylogging.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule (B)**: This involves setting up email forwarding rules to maintain access to a compromised account. It doesn't fit the context of the sequence described.
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading (C)**: This technique involves loading code into a process in a way that makes it difficult to detect. However, the question mentions the DLL is unloaded, and then we're looking for an action before keylogging, which doesn't directly relate to reflective code loading.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts (D)**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. Given that the DLL is dynamically loaded and unloaded, and considering the context of the attack trying to remain stealthy (especially before leveraging keylogging capabilities to obtain sensitive information), hiding artifacts could be a plausible action to avoid detection before proceeding with further malicious activities like keylogging.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the sequence after the Explosive DLL is unloaded and before keylogging is used for credential access.
   - The action needs to fit within the context of the attack's lifecycle, specifically between the execution phase (where the DLL is unloaded) and the credential access phase.
   - Given the emphasis on stealth and evasion throughout the attack, the most plausible technique that aligns with this sequence is hiding artifacts to maintain a low profile before proceeding with keylogging.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred in this sequence is related to evading detection, which aligns with hiding artifacts.

Final Answer: D
