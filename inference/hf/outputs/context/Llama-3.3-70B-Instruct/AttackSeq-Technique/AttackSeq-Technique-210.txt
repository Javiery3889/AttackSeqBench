To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by FamousSparrow, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Command and Control.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - FamousSparrow used SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server via HTTPS with encrypted/decrypted communications.
     - They had the ability to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server as part of their Collection tactics.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the method FamousSparrow most likely used to exfiltrate data after establishing communication with the C&C server.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that FamousSparrow could exfiltrate files to the C&C server as part of their Collection tactics.
   - The question focuses on the exfiltration method after communication with the C&C server is established.
   - Answer choice A (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) directly relates to exfiltrating data over the established command and control channel, which aligns with the Collection tactic of exfiltrating files to the C&C server.
   - Answer choice B (T1055-Process Injection) is related to injecting code into processes, which is not directly relevant to the exfiltration of data.
   - Answer choice C (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery) is about discovering security software, which does not relate to data exfiltration.
   - Answer choice D is a repeat of A, which seems to be a mistake in the options provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details FamousSparrow's ability to exfiltrate files as part of their Collection tactics.
   - The question asks about the exfiltration method after communication with the C&C server is established, using HTTPS and encryption.
   - The most relevant tactic to this scenario is exfiltrating data over the command and control channel, which is directly supported by the report's description of Collection tactics.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for exfiltrating data after establishing communication with the C&C server is exfiltration over the C2 channel.

Final Answer: A
