To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving the CEIDPageLock rootkit distributed by the RIG Exploit kit.
   - **Initial Access**: The rootkit is distributed and tampered with the victim's browser homepage.
   - **Persistence**: The dropper extracts and saves a driver, registers and starts it, and sends the MAC address and user-id to a specified domain.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The driver evades endpoint security products, connects to C&C domains to download an encrypted homepage configuration, and tampers with the browser.
   - **Collection**: The operators gather browsing data on victims.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for the rootkit to establish communication with its hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration after gathering browsing data.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the rootkit's ability to connect with C&C domains to download the homepage configuration.
   - This action implies a need for a communication protocol or method that allows the rootkit to interact with its command and control servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of the communication - The rootkit needs to download the homepage configuration from the C&C server.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the nature of the communication - It involves downloading encrypted data, suggesting a protocol or technique that supports such transactions.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**: This does not directly relate to establishing communication with C&C servers.
     - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is not directly relevant to downloading configurations from C&C servers.
     - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for communication, which could be used to download configurations from C&C servers.
     - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique is related to exploiting vulnerabilities to infect systems, not directly relevant to the communication with C&C servers for downloading configurations.

Given the context and the need for the rootkit to communicate with its C&C servers to download the homepage configuration, the most appropriate technique would be one that facilitates this communication.

**Final Answer: C**
