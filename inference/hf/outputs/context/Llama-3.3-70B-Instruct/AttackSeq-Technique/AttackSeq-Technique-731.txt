To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the 'Red October' campaign, which used various initial access techniques, including exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office documents and Java.
   - After initial access, the main component was set up, which handled communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers.
   - The system received additional spy modules from the C&C server for stealing information.
   - The report mentions the use of a layered C&C infrastructure, with an image of one of the C&C servers showing it acted as a proxy, forwarding requests to another server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely supported hiding the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign, after the main component established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules.
   - The question is focused on identifying a technique used for concealing the true location of the primary C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the mention of a "layered C&C infrastructure" and a C&C server acting as a "proxy forwarding requests to another server."
   - This setup suggests that the attackers used a technique to hide the location of the main ('mothership') C&C server by using an intermediary server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of the technique in question, which is to hide the location of the 'mothership' server.
   - **Step 2**: Recall from the report that the attackers used a proxy server to forward requests, indicating a method to obscure the true location of the C&C server.
   - **Step 3**: Match this information with the provided answer choices to find the technique that aligns with using a proxy to hide the location of a server.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using existing command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, which does not directly relate to hiding server locations.
     - B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to resolve domains or IP addresses, which could be part of hiding infrastructure but doesn't directly match the proxy description.
     - C: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the location of a server, which directly matches the description provided in the report.
     - D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL: This technique involves using a helper DLL to intercept and modify authentication information, which does not relate to hiding server locations.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the description of using a proxy to forward requests to another server, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for hiding the location of the 'mothership' server is using a proxy.

Final Answer: C
