To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: Exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Execution**: Deploying custom malware, including the '.NET backdoor' named 'IPsec Helper'.
   - **Persistence**: Deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts.
   - **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - **Impact**: Deploying wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - The focus is on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to command execution and evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1021-Remote Services (A)**: This involves using remote services to execute commands. While Agrius used RDP for lateral movement, there's no direct indication that remote services were used for command execution after persistence.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal (B)**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. The report does not specifically mention Agrius removing indicators of compromise, but it does discuss command execution and communication with C2 servers, which implies some level of stealth.
   - **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection (C)**: This is a specific technique of process injection. The report does not mention memory injection techniques used by Agrius for command execution or evasion.
   - **T1202-Indirect Command Execution (D)**: This involves executing commands indirectly to evade detection. Given that 'IPsec Helper' executes commands based on instructions from C2 servers and can update its configuration, this could be seen as a form of indirect command execution, allowing Agrius to maintain control while minimizing direct interaction with compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence.
   - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor's ability to execute commands based on C2 server instructions is key. This implies an indirect method of command execution.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention techniques like indicator removal or memory injection in the context of command execution after persistence, the use of a backdoor that awaits and executes commands from C2 servers suggests an indirect approach.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the information provided is related to indirect command execution, which allows for command execution while potentially minimizing direct detection.

Final Answer: D
