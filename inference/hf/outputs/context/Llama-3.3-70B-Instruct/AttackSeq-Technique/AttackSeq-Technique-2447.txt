To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the DRAGONFISH threat group using Elise malware.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
   - **Execution**: The malware executes, injects into the Internet Explorer process, and communicates with a C2 server.
   - **Persistence**: Achieved through the Run Registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Various techniques are used, including anti-VM, obfuscation, and spoofing.
   - **Discovery**: The malware harvests system information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique likely used when the malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server after establishing persistence.
   - The key detail here is the communication with the C2 server for sending harvested data and receiving commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the malware sends data to and downloads files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server with a specific IP address.
   - This communication is related to the malware's ability to exfiltrate data and receive commands, which is a key aspect of Command and Control (C2) behavior.
   - Looking at the answer choices:
     - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This is about evading detection in virtual or sandbox environments, not directly related to C2 communication.
     - **B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**: This involves exploiting weak permissions in services or files, not directly related to the described C2 communication.
     - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which could be relevant but the report does not specify the use of non-standard ports.
     - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the malware's behavior of sending and receiving data using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS (implied by the use of base64-encoded cookie values for data exfiltration).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the communication with the C2 server after establishing persistence.
   - The malware's ability to send harvested data and receive commands from the C2 server using base64-encoded cookie values suggests the use of application layer protocols.
   - Given the information provided and the focus on C2 communication, the most relevant ATT&CK technique is related to using application layer protocols for this purpose.
   - **Final Answer: D**
