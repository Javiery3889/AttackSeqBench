To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Venomous Bear using a dropper to execute the 'NewPass' implant.
   - The implant uses a loader to decode a binary file and extract an agent component.
   - The loader and agent share a JSON configuration in memory, allowing customization by changing configuration entries.
   - The agent is responsible for exfiltrating information and sending it to the command-and-control (C2) server using a POST request with encrypted values.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to enable stealthy communication with the C2 server after the NewPass loader decodes the configuration file and extracts the agent component.
   - The focus is on the method used for communication with the C2 server after the agent is deployed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the NewPass agent exfiltrates data using a POST request with encrypted values to the C2 server.
   - This implies the use of encryption for communication, which is a key aspect of establishing a stealthy (or covert) channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question, which are the decoding of the configuration file, extraction of the agent component, and the establishment of stealthy communication with the C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the use of encryption for data exfiltration (as mentioned in the report) directly relates to establishing a secure, stealthy channel for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Step 3**: Match the details from the report with the provided answer choices to find the best fit.
     - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This choice directly aligns with the report's mention of encrypted values used in POST requests for data exfiltration, which would enable stealthy communication.
     - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**: While steganography is a method for hiding data, the report specifically mentions encryption in the context of communication, not hiding data within other files or media.
     - **C: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This involves using DNS for command and control, which is not mentioned in the report.
     - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This choice is about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel but does not specifically address the method of establishing stealthy communication.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the information in the CTI report and the focus on stealthy communication with the C2 server using encrypted values, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is the establishment of an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: A
