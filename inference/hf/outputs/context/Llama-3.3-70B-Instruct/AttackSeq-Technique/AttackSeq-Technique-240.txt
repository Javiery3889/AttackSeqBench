To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Lazarus group on a cryptocurrency exchange.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: The group sent an email leading to the download of a trojanized application.
     2. **Execution**: The trojanized application executed upon installation and reboot, collecting and sending host information.
     3. **Persistence**: A hidden 'autoupdater' module was installed for persistence and communication with the command and control server.
     4. **Command and Control**: The malware communicated with the command and control server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.
     5. **Impact**: The operation resulted in the compromise of a cryptocurrency exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the Lazarus group's efforts to remain undetected after establishing persistence.
   - The key elements mentioned are the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the technique used after persistence was established, which involves the 'autoupdater' module and the communication with the command and control server.
   - The report mentions the use of a legitimate-looking application (the trojanized Celas Trade Pro) and the communication with the command and control server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string, which could be related to evading detection.
   - Among the answer choices, we need to find the one that best aligns with remaining undetected while using a legitimate-looking application and potentially encrypted or obfuscated network traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the need for a technique that helps in evasion and maintaining stealth.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** involves disguising or hiding malicious data or files, which could apply to both the legitimate-looking application and the potential for encrypted network traffic.
   - **Step 3**: Consider **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** as a technique for hiding malicious code, but it's more about executing the malicious code within a legitimate process, which isn't directly mentioned in the report.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate **T1657-Financial Theft** and **T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software** as less relevant to the specific question of evasion techniques after establishing persistence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of using a legitimate-looking application and the need to remain undetected, the most relevant technique seems to be related to obfuscation or hiding malicious activities.

Final Answer: D
