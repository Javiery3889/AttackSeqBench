To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Machete campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing.
     2. **Execution**: Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
     3. **Persistence**: Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files and directories.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
     5. **Credential Access**: Scanning for key and certificate files and exfiltrating stored credentials.
     6. **Discovery**: Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting devices, producing file listings, and enumerating processes.
     7. **Collection**: Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data.
     8. **Command and Control**: Using FTP and HTTP ports for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transmit files to the C&C servers after staging and encrypting the collected data.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after collecting and staging data in a temporary folder, Machete uses FTP and HTTP for C&C communication, which includes exfiltrating documents.
   - The question specifically asks about transmitting files to the C&C servers after they have been staged and encrypted.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** directly relates to exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the report's description of using FTP and HTTP for C&C communication, including exfiltration.
   - **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol** involves exfiltration over a non-C2 channel that is symmetrically encrypted, which doesn't directly match the primary method described (using standard FTP and HTTP ports for C&C).
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** and **T1595-Active Scanning** are not directly related to the exfiltration of data to C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Machete campaign's method of exfiltrating data after collection and encryption involves using established C&C channels.
   - The report specifies the use of FTP and HTTP for communication with C&C servers, which includes exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for transmitting files to the C&C servers after staging and encrypting the data is exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   
Final Answer: C
