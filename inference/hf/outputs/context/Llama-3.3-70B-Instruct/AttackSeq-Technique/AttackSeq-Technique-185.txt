To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Infamous Chisel, a malware collection targeting Android devices, associated with Sandworm activity.
   - Key capabilities include:
     - **Execution**: Executes shell scripts as the root user.
     - **Persistence**: Replaces the legitimate netd system binary to maintain root privileges.
     - **Privilege Escalation**: Inherits root privileges by replacing netd and being executed by init.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Decompresses executables and checks execution context to evade detection.
     - **Credential Access**: Scrapes files for credentials and uses tcpdump for network traffic monitoring.
     - **Collection**: Automatically collects files based on predefined extensions and from application/data directories.
     - **Command and Control**: Uses SCP, Tor hidden services, and SSH for communication.
     - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates files at regular intervals via Tor and SSH.
     - **Impact**: Potentially impacts the netd service.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enables Infamous Chisel to enumerate data directories and gather system information after collecting files of interest but before exfiltrating them.
   - The relevant sequence here involves file collection and the actions taken before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that Infamous Chisel collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories.
   - Before exfiltrating these files, the malware would need to identify where these files and directories are located.
   - The answer choices provided relate to different techniques for gathering information or interacting with systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves stealing web cookies, which doesn't directly relate to enumerating local data directories or gathering system information for file exfiltration.
   - **B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which doesn't directly apply to the task of enumerating directories or gathering system information.
   - **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique is about gathering information from cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the local system directory enumeration.
   - **D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves methods for discovering local file and directory structures, which aligns with the need to identify and gather files from specific directories before exfiltration.

Given the need for Infamous Chisel to identify and collect files from specific directories on the local system before exfiltrating them, the most relevant ATT&CK technique for this step would be file and directory discovery.

**Final Answer: D**
