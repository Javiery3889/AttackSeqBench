To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Agrius' attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploiting public-facing applications.
     2. **Execution**: Deploying custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
     3. **Persistence**: Deploying webshells and registering the custom backdoor as a service.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using webshells with obfuscation and the backdoor's ability to update itself and delete traces.
     5. **Command and Control**: Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP.
     6. **Impact**: Deploying wipers to destroy data.
   - Key detail: After gaining initial access, Agrius used webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled Agrius to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network after using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - The question focuses on the technique used for remote exploitation after initial lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement, the next step involves exploiting systems remotely within the network.
   - **T1552.008-Chat Messages** (A) is not relevant to exploiting systems remotely.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** (B) involves establishing an encrypted channel, which could be part of command and control but doesn't directly relate to exploiting systems remotely.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** (C) directly involves exploiting services that are available remotely, which aligns with the scenario of exploiting systems within the network after gaining access.
   - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares** (D) involves using SMB or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which is not the focus of the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about exploiting systems remotely after lateral movement via RDP.
   - The most relevant technique for exploiting systems remotely within a network, especially after establishing a foothold and using webshells for lateral movement, is the exploitation of remote services.
   - This technique aligns with the scenario described, where after gaining initial access and moving laterally, the next logical step would involve exploiting remote services to further compromise the network.

Final Answer: C
