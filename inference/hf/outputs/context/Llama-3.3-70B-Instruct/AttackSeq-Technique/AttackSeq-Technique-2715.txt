To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through social engineering techniques, delivering the IEXPL0RE RAT via email attachments.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the installation of a launcher program that unpacks and runs the RAT in memory.
   - **Persistence** is established through various means, including installing binaries and startup links.
   - **Collection** involves keystroke recording and data exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control** is maintained through encrypted HTTP communications.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the delivery of the IEXPL0RE RAT.
   - The delivery method involved social engineering and evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the RAT is delivered and then installs a launcher program that goes through multiple stages to unpack and run the actual RAT in memory, we are looking for a technique that aligns with the execution and establishment of the RAT in the system.
   - **T1098.005-Device Registration** is not directly related to the execution or establishment of the RAT in memory.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** and **T1055-Process Injection** both relate to executing code in the context of another process, which aligns with the RAT being injected into memory.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** refers to the use of application layer protocols for C2 communications, which happens after the RAT is established but is not the immediate next step after delivery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The IEXPL0RE RAT's delivery via social engineering and its subsequent execution involve sophisticated evasion techniques, including running the RAT in memory.
   - The immediate concern after delivery is how the RAT establishes itself within the system without being detected, which involves executing its payload in a manner that evades traditional detection methods.
   - Between **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** and **T1055-Process Injection**, the latter is a broader category that includes the technique of injecting code into a process, which is what the RAT does by running in memory.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after the RAT's delivery is the injection of the RAT into memory, which aligns with **T1055-Process Injection**.

Final Answer: D
