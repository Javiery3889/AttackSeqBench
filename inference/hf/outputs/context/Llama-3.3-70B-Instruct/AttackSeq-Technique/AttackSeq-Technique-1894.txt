To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the activities of FIN13, a threat actor targeting organizations in Mexico.
   - The attack sequence can be summarized by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution.
     4. **Persistence**: Using methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and deploying malware.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizing techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employing passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for evasion.
     7. **Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials through process memory dumping and network sniffing.
     8. **Discovery**: Gathering information on network and host configurations.
     9. **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using proxies and encoding data for communication.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 utilized lateral movement methods.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are:
     - A: T1056.001-Keylogging
     - B: T1123-Audio Capture
     - C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service
     - D: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After lateral movement, the threat actor would likely aim to achieve their objectives, which could include exfiltrating sensitive data, capturing additional credentials, or preparing for further malicious activities.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging** (A) could be a possibility as it involves capturing credentials, but it's more specific to keystroke logging.
   - **T1123-Audio Capture** (B) seems less relevant as there's no indication FIN13 focuses on audio capture for their objectives.
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** (C) aligns closely with the report's description of FIN13 exfiltrating data over web services for fraudulent transactions.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** (D) could be relevant but is less specific to the web service exfiltration mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given FIN13's objectives of stealing sensitive data for fraudulent transactions and their method of exfiltrating data over web services, the most logical step after lateral movement would be to exfiltrate the targeted data.
   - The report specifically mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, which matches **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after lateral movement is exfiltrating data over web services.

Final Answer: C
