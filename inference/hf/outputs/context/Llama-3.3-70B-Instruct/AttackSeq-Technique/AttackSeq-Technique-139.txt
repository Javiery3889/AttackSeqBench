To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT-TOCS, which starts with **Initial Access** using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - The **Execution** phase involves downloading Shellcode script functionalities executed in memory without writing to the hard disk, and communication via Beacon mode.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include running in memory and using multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement** is possible through network projection within the internal network.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by APT-TOCS to establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs after downloading Shellcode script functionalities and maintaining multi-beacon communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on establishing secure communication, which implies the use of encryption or a method to securely transmit data.
   - The report mentions the use of Beacon mode and transmitting data via the Cookie field, indicating a form of communication that could be related to establishing a secure or covert channel.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly relates to establishing secure communication, which could involve HTTP GET requests to specific URLs as a method to hide the communication within normal web traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The APT-TOCS attack involves sophisticated evasion techniques and the ability to communicate covertly.
   - The use of multi-beacon communication and transmitting data via the Cookie field suggests an effort to hide or secure the communication.
   - Establishing an **Encrypted Channel (T1573)** would be a logical step for APT-TOCS to securely communicate with its command and control servers, especially when considering the use of HTTP GET requests to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is relevant to the initial access and execution phases but does not directly relate to establishing secure communication.
   - **T1654-Log Enumeration** and **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** are not directly implied by the information given in the question or the report as the next step after establishing multi-beacon communication for evasion purposes.

**Final Answer: D**
