To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the RIG EK exploit kit's activities, starting with **Resource Development** where it uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands.
   - **Initial Access** is achieved through Drive-by Compromise, using malvertising or compromised websites to redirect users to the exploit kit's landing page.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used, including proxy servers and antivirus testing.
   - **Command and Control** involves a complex infrastructure with proxy servers, Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), and an API server to serve exploits.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after enabling Initial Access, specifically to execute an obfuscated PowerShell script for fetching malware.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves gaining initial access and then executing a PowerShell script.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the use of exploits to execute commands on victim machines, which aligns with the idea of executing scripts post-initial access.
   - The question specifically mentions executing an obfuscated PowerShell script, which suggests the use of a scripting interpreter to run the script.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** is achieved, as described, through Drive-by Compromise.
   - The next step involves executing an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware. This implies the use of a scripting interpreter, as PowerShell is a command and scripting language.
   - Looking at the answer choices:
     - **A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This involves modifying PowerShell profiles, which is not directly related to executing scripts for fetching malware.
     - **B: T1053.003-Cron**: This involves scheduling tasks, which is not directly relevant to the immediate execution of a PowerShell script.
     - **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: While RIG EK does obtain capabilities, this is more related to the exploit kit's development and operation rather than the specific action of executing a script.
     - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This directly involves using a command and scripting interpreter (like PowerShell) to execute scripts, which aligns with the action of executing an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

**Final Answer**: D
