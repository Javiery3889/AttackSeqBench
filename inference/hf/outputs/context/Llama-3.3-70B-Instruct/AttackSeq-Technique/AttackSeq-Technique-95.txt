To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to download an HTA file.
     2. **Execution**: The HTA file executes a script, checks for antivirus software using WMI, and communicates with the C2 server.
     3. **Persistence**: Establishment of persistence through a registry Run key.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Avoidance of PowerShell and use of DLL sideloading.
     5. **Discovery**: Use of WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique likely used to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net, after using WMI for checking antivirus software and avoiding PowerShell.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key elements here are the use of WMI for discovery and the communication with the C2 server.
   - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This involves using multiple proxies to obscure the source of traffic. While it could be related to C2 communication, it doesn't directly relate to sending system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves collecting information about the system, which aligns with the use of WMI to check for antivirus software, but the question specifically asks about sending this information to the C2 server.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and considering the context of sending detected antivirus software information, this seems plausible.
   - **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This involves using a combination of identities to authenticate. It doesn't directly relate to sending system information to a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server.
   - The use of WMI for discovery and the avoidance of PowerShell indicate a specific approach to system interaction and evasion.
   - The communication with the C2 server using webserv-redir.net suggests the use of an application layer protocol for this purpose.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique for sending information over a network to a C2 server, especially considering the context provided.

Final Answer: C
