To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the 'Red October' campaign, which used various initial access techniques, including exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office documents and Java.
   - Upon initial access, a main component was set up for communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers.
   - The campaign involved downloading additional modules from the C&C server for stealing information, which was then sent back to the C&C server.
   - The report mentions a layered C&C infrastructure, with an image of one of the C&C servers showing it acted as a proxy, forwarding requests to another server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated the 'Red October' campaign's C&C servers in hiding the 'mothership' control server's location after initiating communication.
   - The question is focused on the technique used for concealing the true location of the primary C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the report relevant to the question is the mention of a "layered C&C infrastructure" and a C&C server acting as a "proxy forwarding requests to another server."
   - This setup implies that the attackers used a method to indirect or obscure the communication path to the main C&C server, making it harder to detect or take down the operation by hiding the 'mothership' control server's location.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using existing command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While useful for executing malicious commands, it doesn't directly relate to hiding the location of a C&C server.
   - **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order used by the operating system to load DLLs, which can be used for persistence or privilege escalation but doesn't directly relate to hiding C&C server locations.
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves using dynamic DNS or other methods to rapidly change the IP address associated with a domain name, making it difficult to track or block the C&C server. However, the report specifically mentions proxying, not dynamic DNS.
   - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique doesn't directly apply to the scenario described, as it involves using publish/subscribe messaging patterns for C2 communications, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the report.

Given the information in the report about the C&C server acting as a proxy to forward requests, none of the provided options directly match the description of using a proxy to hide the location of the 'mothership' control server. However, the closest concept related to hiding or obscuring the location of a C&C server involves indirect communication methods. Since the question specifically asks about hiding the 'mothership' control server's location and the report mentions a proxy setup, we should consider techniques that facilitate indirect communication. 

The report's description most closely aligns with the concept of using intermediaries (like proxies) for communication, which isn't directly listed among the provided choices. However, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** could be considered in the context of evasion techniques, but it's more about changing IP addresses than using proxies. Given the options and focusing strictly on the provided choices without additional context or techniques, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** might seem like a plausible choice for evasion, but it doesn't perfectly match the proxy description. 

However, upon closer inspection and aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's focus on specific, observable techniques, the question's context about hiding the C&C server's location through proxying doesn't directly match any of the provided choices as described. The mention of proxying suggests an intermediary step in communication, which could be related to **T1090-Proxy**, a technique not listed among the options but relevant to the scenario described.

Given the constraints of the question and the provided options, and focusing on the closest match to the concept of hiding or obscuring the location of a C&C server through indirect means (though not perfectly matching the proxy scenario described), one might be inclined to consider techniques that facilitate evasion or indirect communication. However, it's crucial to note that the exact technique described (using a proxy to hide the C&C server) isn't directly listed among the provided choices.

**Final Answer: C**
