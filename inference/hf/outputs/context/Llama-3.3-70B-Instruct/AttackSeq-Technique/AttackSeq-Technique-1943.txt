To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack involving the Smooth Operator malware, which targets macOS systems via a supply chain attack on 3CX software.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software.
     3. **Persistence**: It persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs several evasion techniques.
     5. **Discovery**: Collects information from the victim machine, including OS version and domain/account name values from the 3CX file config.json.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Automatically exfiltrates collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to extract domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json during the collection process.
   - The relevant sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves data collection, specifically extracting specific data from a configuration file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that during the **Discovery** phase, Smooth Operator collects information including domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json.
   - The question specifically asks about extracting data from a configuration file (config.json), which aligns with the **Discovery** phase of the attack.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - A: **T1562-Impair Defenses** - This involves impairing system defenses, which does not directly relate to collecting data from a configuration file.
     - B: **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This involves using a multi-hop proxy for communication, not collecting data from local files.
     - C: **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection** - This involves collecting email, which is not relevant to extracting data from a local configuration file.
     - D: **T1602-Data from Configuration Repository** - This involves collecting data from configuration repositories or files, which directly aligns with extracting domain and account name values from the config.json file.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the technique used to extract specific data from a configuration file during the collection process.
   - The CTI report indicates that Smooth Operator collects system details, including data from the 3CX config.json file, as part of its discovery phase.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action is collecting data from a configuration repository or file.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with this action is **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**.

Final Answer: D
