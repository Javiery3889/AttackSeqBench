To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents that exploit CVE-2012-0158.
   - It then mentions **Defense Evasion** tactics, including the modification of the RIPTIDE backdoor to create the HIGHTIDE malware family, which was done to avoid detection.
   - The report also mentions the use of other backdoors like THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT, indicating an evolution in tactics to evade defenses.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during **Command and Control** involving HIGHTIDE's communication with an IP address, after the initial access via spear phishing.
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect of the attack, specifically how HIGHTIDE, a backdoor, communicates with a command and control (C2) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that HIGHTIDE is a backdoor and is involved in communication with a C2 server, we need to consider how backdoors typically communicate with their C2 servers.
   - Backdoors often use encrypted channels to communicate with C2 servers to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly relates to the use of encryption for communication, which is a common technique used by backdoors like HIGHTIDE to hide their C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - Spear phishing with malicious documents.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the defense evasion techniques - Modification of backdoors to avoid detection.
   - **Step 3**: Understand the role of HIGHTIDE - A backdoor used for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the most likely ATT&CK technique for HIGHTIDE's C2 communication - Encrypted Channel, as it is a common method for backdoors to communicate stealthily.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of backdoor communication and the need for stealth, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is the use of an encrypted channel for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D
