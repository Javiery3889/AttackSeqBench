To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report details an attack using BlackEnergy 3 malware, which gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114) in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
   - After initial access, the malware achieves persistence, employs defense evasion techniques, discovers information for lateral movement, moves laterally, establishes command and control, and exfiltrates data.

2. **Identify the attack sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - Persistence: Registering a binary to the startup shell.
   - Defense Evasion: Using various anti-debugging techniques.
   - Discovery: Gathering network information.
   - Lateral Movement: Sending data to servers for movement.
   - Command and Control: Communicating with a C2 server.
   - Exfiltration: Sending gathered information to the C2 server.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after BlackEnergy 3 malware gained initial access.
   - The techniques provided in the answer choices are:
     - A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job
     - B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure
     - C: T1204-User Execution
     - D: T1622-Debugger Evasion

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves orchestrating containers, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate actions after exploiting a vulnerability in a desktop application like Microsoft Office.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This involves hiding infrastructure, which could be part of the attack but is not directly related to the immediate post-exploitation actions of the malware.
   - **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by convincing a user to run it, which is close to the initial access vector described but not necessarily the immediate next step after gaining access.
   - **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: Given that the malware employs various anti-debugging techniques as part of its defense evasion strategies, and considering that these techniques would be crucial immediately after gaining access to evade detection and analysis, this seems like a plausible next step.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware gains initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - Immediately after, to maintain its presence and avoid detection, employing defense evasion techniques would be critical.
   - Among the provided options, **T1622-Debugger Evasion** directly aligns with the defense evasion strategies mentioned in the CTI report, such as using anti-debugging techniques.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur after gaining initial access, given the context of the attack and the need for the malware to evade detection, is **Debugger Evasion**.

Final Answer: D
