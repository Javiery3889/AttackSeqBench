To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an APT attack involving a new backdoor malware that uses the Dropbox API for command and control activities.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     - **Initial Access**: Leveraging the legitimate Windows Defender Core Process to load a malicious DLL.
     - **Execution**: The malicious executable interacts with the Dropbox API, bypasses UAC, and has persistence mechanisms.
     - **Persistence**: Registering as a startup program or as a system service.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Employing a UAC bypass technique.
     - **Discovery**: Collecting basic information like IP address, hostname, username, OS version, and searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
     - **Command and Control**: Connecting to a C&C server, sending data using fake HTTP POST requests, and interacting with Dropbox.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather screen recording files in the Collection phase after the malware collected basic information during the Discovery phase.
   - The question implies a sequence where after discovering basic system and user information, the malware proceeds to collect more specific data, such as screen recordings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the collection of screen recording files. However, it does discuss the malware's ability to execute various commands, including managing files and opening terminals, which suggests it has capabilities beyond just basic information collection.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to find the one that best aligns with the collection of screen recording files or similar sensitive data.
     - **A: T1036.006-Space after Filename**: This technique involves using spaces at the end of a filename to potentially evade detection, not directly related to collecting screen recordings.
     - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique directly involves capturing screenshots, which could be part of collecting sensitive information and aligns with the idea of gathering screen recording files.
     - **C: T1012-Query Registry**: This involves querying the Windows Registry for specific information, which was already mentioned in the Discovery phase for finding Bitcoin wallet addresses but does not directly relate to screen recordings.
     - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications, which does not directly relate to the collection of screen recordings.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to gather screen recording files after the Discovery phase.
   - The most relevant technique to collecting visual data like screen recordings is **Screen Capture**.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with the collection of screen recording files in the context provided is **B: T1113-Screen Capture**.

Final Answer: B
