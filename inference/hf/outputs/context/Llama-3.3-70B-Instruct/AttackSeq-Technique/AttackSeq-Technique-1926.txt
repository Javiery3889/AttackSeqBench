To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via a phishing email that leads to the installation of the 'FriarFox' malicious Firefox browser extension.
   - The extension is used for **Defense Evasion**, allowing threat actors to access user data and contact a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Phishing email leading to the installation of the FriarFox browser extension.
   - Defense Evasion: The extension accesses user data and contacts a command and control server.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred as the FriarFox extension contacted a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
   - The key detail here is the communication between the extension and a server to retrieve a payload.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for communication. While encryption might be used, the report does not specifically mention the use of an encrypted channel for communicating with the command and control server.
   - **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This involves using alternative credentials or authentication materials. The report does not indicate that the extension uses alternate authentication material to contact the server.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. The report mentions the extension contacting a command and control server to retrieve a payload, which implies the use of an application layer protocol (like HTTP/HTTPS) for this communication.
   - **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This involves hijacking a session of a remote service. The report does not describe hijacking a session but rather the extension contacting a server to retrieve a payload.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the communication between the FriarFox extension and a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
   - The report indicates that after the extension is installed, it contacts a command and control server, which suggests a communication protocol is used.
   - Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to the scenario of the extension communicating with a server to retrieve a payload, as it involves the use of protocols like HTTP/HTTPS for communication.

**Final Answer: C**
