To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that started with **Initial Access** through a compromised website, leading to the download of malicious JavaScript files and eventually malware.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the running of a Win32 executable (gpsvc.exe) that is packed with 'Enigma Protector' and drops a known Lazarus group malware variant.
   - **Defense Evasion** is achieved through the use of 'Enigma Protector' and possibly by mimicking normal system queries.
   - **Command and Control** communications are established with specific IP addresses, and the malware gathers system information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after defense evasion (using 'Enigma Protector') when the malware gathered detailed system information.
   - The key detail here is the gathering of "detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections."

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after using 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, the malware executes "a series of basic system information gathering commands."
   - The question specifically mentions gathering "detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections," which aligns with system information gathering.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the phase in the attack where system information gathering occurs. This is after the malware has been executed and defense evasion techniques have been employed.
   - **Step 2**: Match the system information gathering activity with the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which does not directly relate to gathering system information.
     - B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery: This technique involves discovering the network connections and configurations of a system, which aligns with the information gathering described.
     - C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery: This is about discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not mentioned in the report.
     - D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries: This involves discovering autostart entries, which is not directly related to gathering network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - **Step 4**: Based on the evaluation, the technique that most closely matches the activity of gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections is **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B**
