To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Venomous Bear threat actor using a dropper to execute the 'NewPass' implant.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     - **Execution**: The dropper executes the NewPass implant.
     - **Persistence**: The malware creates a new Windows service for persistence.
     - **Defense Evasion**: The loader decodes a binary file and extracts the agent, using a JSON configuration and simple XOR algorithm for decoding.
     - **Command and Control**: The NewPass agent communicates with a command-and-control server using encrypted HTTP requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves establishing communication and then potentially exfiltrating data or further establishing a secure channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the NewPass agent has established communication with the command-and-control server using stealthy POST requests and encryption, the next logical step would involve using this established channel for further malicious activities.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the established communication channel and the typical goals of such malware (e.g., stealing sensitive information).
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** could be a possibility but is more specific to exfiltration via web services, which is not directly indicated after establishing the C2 channel.
   - **T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition** is related to loading dynamic libraries, which is not directly related to the action of establishing communication and then potentially exfiltrating data.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is about establishing an encrypted channel, which has already been accomplished according to the question stem.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The NewPass agent establishes an encrypted communication channel with the command-and-control server.
   - The next logical step after establishing a secure, stealthy communication channel would be to use it for malicious purposes such as exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** directly aligns with using the established command and control channel for data exfiltration, which is a common goal of such malware operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after establishing communication would involve exfiltrating data over this established channel.

Final Answer: A
