To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing, using malicious MS Office documents to deliver a macro that downloads malicious payloads.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the macro executing and downloading payloads, including a malware downloader that fetches the RMS tool and other components.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by adding a registry key to launch the RMS executable on user login.
   - **Defense Evasion** involves using the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement, leveraging its legitimacy to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely allowed the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure after the download of malicious payloads.
   - The key here is understanding how the RMS executable communicates with the threat actor's infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after the initial payload is downloaded, the RMS tool is used for further malicious activities, including reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - The question is about maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure, which implies a method of communication or control.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure such as C2 servers, but it doesn't directly relate to maintaining contact.
     - **B: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This involves using JavaScript for execution, which is not directly mentioned in the context of maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
     - **C: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using remote access software to maintain access to a network. Given that RMS is a remote administration tool used by the threat actors for malicious activities, this seems highly relevant.
     - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique and does not relate to maintaining contact with the infrastructure after the initial compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report highlights the use of the RMS tool for malicious activities after the initial access.
   - The question focuses on how the RMS executable maintains contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
   - Given the RMS tool's role as a remote administration tool, it is logical that it would be used for maintaining access and communication with the threat actor's infrastructure.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that aligns with this activity is **T1219-Remote Access Software**.

Final Answer: C
