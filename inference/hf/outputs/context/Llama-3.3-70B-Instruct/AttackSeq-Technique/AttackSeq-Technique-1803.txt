To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses a cyber attack involving command and control (C2) servers instructing bots to attack specific websites, including those owned by Next Media and the HKGolden forum.
   - The attack involves the use of W32 Cabinet self-extracting files that drop a variant of the KernelBot DDoS tool.
   - The KernelBot receives targeting instructions from C2 servers and uses single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
   - The primary goal is to attack domains and IPs associated with Next Media, Apple Daily websites, and the HKGolden forum, which are related to promoting democracy in Hong Kong.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Receiving instructions from C2 servers.
     2. Encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys.
     3. Executing DDoS attacks on targeted websites.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from C2 servers and encoding configuration files.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves adding an entry to the user's autostart directory to execute malware when the user logs in. While persistence is a common goal in many attacks, the question specifically mentions disrupting websites, which doesn't directly relate to autostart entries.
   - **T1498 - Network Denial of Service**: This technique involves overloading a network or system to make it unavailable, which aligns with the DDoS attacks described in the report aimed at disrupting targeted websites.
   - **T1499.001 - OS Exhaustion Flood**: This is a subtype of network denial of service where an attacker attempts to consume system resources, leading to a denial of service. While related, the report specifically mentions DDoS attacks without detailing the method as an OS exhaustion flood.
   - **T1590.001 - Domain Properties**: This technique involves modifying domain properties to disrupt or manipulate network activity. The report does not specifically mention altering domain properties as part of the attack.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The report clearly outlines a DDoS attack campaign targeting specific websites.
   - The question asks for the technique used to disrupt these websites after receiving C2 instructions and encoding configuration files.
   - The most relevant technique to the described action of disrupting websites through DDoS attacks is **T1498 - Network Denial of Service**.

**Final Answer: B**
