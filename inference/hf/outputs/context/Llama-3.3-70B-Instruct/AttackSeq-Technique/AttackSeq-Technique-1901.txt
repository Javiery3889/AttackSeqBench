To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by TeamTNT that starts with **Reconnaissance**, where they use a specific image to conduct reconnaissance and spread malware.
   - The attack involves **Initial Access** through exposed Docker API servers and a new vector via an open Weave Scope service.
   - **Execution** of a coin miner occurs after it's downloaded and saved as /usr/sbin/docker-update.
   - The report mentions the use of a shell script that scans for open Docker API endpoints using the masscan tool.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when TeamTNT scanned for open Docker API endpoints and employed iplogger.org to track infected hosts.
   - The key actions here are scanning for open Docker API endpoints and tracking infected hosts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions scanning for open Docker API endpoints using the masscan tool, which aligns with discovering and potentially exploiting services or resources within the target environment.
   - The use of iplogger.org to track infected hosts implies a form of reconnaissance or discovery to understand the environment and the spread of the malware.
   - **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery** involves techniques used to discover containers and resources that can be used for further exploitation. This includes scanning for open ports and services, which aligns with the masscan tool's usage for finding open Docker API endpoints.
   - **T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging** is about impairing command history logging, which doesn't directly relate to scanning for open endpoints or tracking infected hosts.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is relevant to the execution phase but not directly to scanning for open endpoints.
   - **T1007-System Service Discovery** is about discovering system services, which could be related but is broader and not as specific to container and resource discovery as T1613.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of scanning for open Docker API endpoints and tracking infected hosts, which is a form of reconnaissance and discovery within the target environment.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique to this action is **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**, as it specifically involves discovering and potentially exploiting containers and resources, such as open Docker API endpoints.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the discovery and scanning actions described in the question.

Final Answer: A
