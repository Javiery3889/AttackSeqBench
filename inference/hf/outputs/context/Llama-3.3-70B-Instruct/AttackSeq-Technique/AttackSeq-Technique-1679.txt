To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes a series of attacks by the 'Evil Corp' group aiming to deploy WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The attack sequence involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Using SocGholish framework on compromised websites.
     2. **Initial Access**: Delivering malicious JavaScript via compromised websites, leading to the execution of PowerShell scripts.
     3. **Execution**: Deploying Cobalt Strike to execute a loader and then a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Using the Software Licensing User Interface tool and Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Disabling Windows Defender and stopping services before launching the ransomware.
     6. **Credential Access**: Using Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and log file clearing.
     7. **Discovery**: Profiling computers and searching for computer objects in the Active Directory.
     8. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C&C domain.
     9. **Impact**: Encrypting computers and servers, demanding ransom.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique likely used after credential dumping and log file clearing, specifically when executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.
   - The relevant part of the report mentions using Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and then using the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the execution of processes on remote computers, which aligns with using remote services to propagate across the network.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** involves using remote services to execute commands on remote systems, which matches the description of using wmic.exe to execute commands on remote computers.
   - **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact** refers to encrypting data to disrupt the availability of the data, which is the final goal but not the method of propagation.
   - **T1080-Taint Shared Content** involves modifying shared content to include malicious components, which does not directly relate to executing processes on remote computers.
   - **T1583.004-Server** is not directly mentioned in the provided report context and does not clearly align with the described action of executing commands on remote computers using wmic.exe.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers used Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and log file clearing.
   - To propagate across the network, they would need to execute processes on remote computers.
   - The report mentions using wmic.exe for this purpose, which aligns with using remote services.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique used for this purpose is **T1021-Remote Services**.

Final Answer: C
