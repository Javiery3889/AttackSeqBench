To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Malicious LNK files distributed via spear-phishing.
     2. **Execution**: LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack involving commands to decode, decompress, and execute files, including a JavaScript file.
     3. **Persistence**: The JavaScript file creates and executes files, copies them to the startup directory, and adds them to scheduled tasks.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The attack uses renamed system utilities (e.g., 'certutil.exe' to 'gosia.exe') to bypass security detection.
     5. **Discovery**: The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information using 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after discovering IP address information to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves creating 'd3reEW.exe' for IP address discovery and then enabling HTTPS communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after the discovery phase (where 'd3reEW.exe' is used with 'cmd /c ipconfig'), the JavaScript file sends a POST request to a hardcoded URL, which implies communication with a C&C server.
   - To enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server, the technique would involve using an application layer protocol, as HTTPS is an application-layer protocol used for secure communication over the internet.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about enabling HTTPS communication with the C&C server after IP address discovery.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for enabling HTTPS communication would be related to using a protocol at the application layer, as HTTPS operates at this layer.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the technique that involves the use of application-layer protocols, which would include HTTPS for secure communication with a C&C server.
   - The other options do not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication:
     - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is about scheduling tasks for persistence, not about communication protocols.
     - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy** could be related to proxying traffic but is not directly about enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.
     - **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery** is more about discovering internet connectivity, which is not the focus of enabling secure communication with a C&C server.

Final Answer: A
