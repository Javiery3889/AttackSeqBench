To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with aviation-related file names.
   - The Elirks malware is used, which retrieves its C2 (Command and Control) address by accessing predetermined microblog services or SNS (Social Networking Services) where attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Through spear-phishing emails.
   - Followed by: Elirks malware establishing contact with a C2 server by accessing pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely followed the initial access achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails, specifically after using Elirks malware to establish contact with a C2 server.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the use of microblog or social networking services to retrieve C2 addresses. This implies the use of web services to facilitate command and control communications.
   - **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server. Given that Elirks retrieves its C2 address by accessing microblog services or SNS, this technique aligns with the described behavior of using web services for C2 communication.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access is through spear-phishing, which is not the question's focus.
   - The question focuses on what happens after initial access, specifically how the malware communicates with its C2 server.
   - The use of microblog services or SNS for C2 communication points towards leveraging web services for malicious communication.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that follows the initial access and aligns with the described behavior of the Elirks malware is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: C**
