To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT15 that lasted from May 2016 to late 2017.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: APT15 gained access to the network, compromising over 30 hosts.
     2. **Execution**: Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS), with RoyalCLI bypassing policy settings to enable command prompt access.
     3. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installed itself persistently on the victim's network.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
     5. **Credential Access**: Used Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate.
     6. **Collection**: Used various tools to export data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after APT15 evaded policy settings (by copying and patching cmd.exe) to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The key event here is the evasion of policy settings and the subsequent action that would enable the persistent installation of RoyalDNS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The evasion of policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe is directly related to the **Execution** phase, specifically how RoyalCLI operates.
   - The question is about what happened after this evasion, focusing on facilitating the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - **Persistence** is the tactic related to maintaining access, which includes installing backdoors like RoyalDNS persistently.
   - Among the answer choices, we need to find the technique that aligns with the actions taken after evading defenses (in this case, policy settings) to ensure persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the action of evading policy settings as part of the **Execution** tactic, specifically through the use of RoyalCLI.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question is asking about the technique used after this evasion to facilitate the persistent installation of RoyalDNS.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the tactics and techniques involved in maintaining persistence and evading defenses.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices:
     - A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable: This is related to hooking, which is not directly mentioned in the context of evading policy settings for RoyalDNS installation.
     - B: T1562-Impair Defenses: This technique involves impairing system defenses, which aligns with evading policy settings to facilitate further malicious activity, such as the installation of a backdoor.
     - C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption: This is about encrypting data in a way that it can be decrypted, which does not directly relate to the evasion of policy settings for backdoor installation.
     - D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates: While related to credential access, this does not directly pertain to the evasion of policy settings for the purpose of installing a backdoor persistently.
   - **Conclusion**: The most relevant technique after evading policy settings (to facilitate the persistent installation of RoyalDNS) is impairing defenses, as it directly relates to actions taken to bypass security measures for malicious purposes.

Final Answer: B
