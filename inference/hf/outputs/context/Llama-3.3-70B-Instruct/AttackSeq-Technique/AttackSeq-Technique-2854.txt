To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via malicious shortcut files sent as email attachments, which infect the host with Asruex malware.
   - Upon infection, the malware executes a PowerShell command to download a batch file, which then downloads a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document (**Execution**).
   - The downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware, which communicates with a C&C server over HTTP (**Command and Control**).
   - The report also mentions the malware's ability to download and execute a plug-in (AdvProv.dll) for expanded functions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely follows the execution of PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable and a decoy document, specifically to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software.
   - The question is focused on identifying a technique used to evade detection or analysis, particularly in a sandbox or virtual environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report details the execution of PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable and a decoy document as part of the attack sequence.
   - To hinder analysis, especially by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software, the attackers would likely employ techniques that help in evading detection or sandbox evasion.
   - Looking at the answer choices:
     - **A: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server**: This does not directly relate to evading detection or sandbox evasion.
     - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**: While data encoding can be used to evade detection, the question specifically mentions detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software, which is more about evading analysis rather than just encoding data.
     - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**: This technique is more related to privilege escalation or maintaining access rather than evading detection.
     - **D: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves disrupting or disabling security controls, which can include detecting and evading virtual machines and anti-virus software to hinder analysis.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used to hinder analysis by detecting virtual machines and anti-virus software after the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - The most relevant technique to this action, based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, is impairing defenses, which includes actions taken to evade detection and disrupt security controls.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely follows the described action in the attack sequence is **T1562-Impair Defenses**, as it directly relates to evading detection and analysis.

Final Answer: D
