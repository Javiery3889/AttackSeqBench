To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Mustang Panda that starts with **Initial Access** via spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files.
   - These '.lnk' files contain embedded HTA scripts that, when executed, drop and open decoy documents while running malicious payloads in the background.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the '.lnk' files executing VBscript or PowerShell script to drop Cobalt Strike Stagers and open decoy documents, with PlugX as a primary payload.
   - **Command and Control** involves communication with compromised systems through C2 domains and IP addresses.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files after Mustang Panda executed the embedded HTA scripts.
   - The question focuses on the method used to trick users into opening or executing the malicious files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail from the CTI report relevant to the question is the use of spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files to initiate the attack.
   - The question is about deceiving users into executing these files, which directly relates to the initial phase of the attack.
   - Let's evaluate the answer choices:
     - **A: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware or tools to appear like legitimate files or processes. While relevant to evasion, it's not directly about deceiving users into executing files.
     - **B: T1070.006-Timestomp**: This involves modifying file timestamps to disguise malicious activity, not directly related to deceiving users into executing files.
     - **C: T1647-Plist File Modification**: This technique is about modifying Plist files to achieve persistence on macOS systems, not relevant to the scenario described.
     - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into performing certain actions, such as executing malicious files, which aligns with the spearphishing campaign described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that the attack begins with spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files.
   - The question asks about deceiving users into executing these files, which is a direct result of the spearphishing campaign.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1566-Phishing** is the technique that directly corresponds to the method used by Mustang Panda to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report is related to phishing.

Final Answer: D
