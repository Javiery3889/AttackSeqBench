To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the ScarCruft group, starting with **Initial Access** through phishing emails that lead to the download of Office documents containing malicious macros.
   - The **Execution** phase involves loading the Chinotto malware and using PowerShell, Golang malware, and BITSAdmin for DLL Side-Loading.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques, such as DLL Side-Loading, are used to avoid detection.
   - In the **Collection** phase, the group collects information and exfiltrates data using tools like UltraVNC.
   - **Command and Control** is established using HTTP requests to PHP scripts on C2 servers and Golang malware for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to send data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure after establishing command and control channels.
   - The relevant part of the report for this question is the **Command and Control** section, which mentions the use of HTTP requests and Golang malware for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions sending data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure after command and control channels have been established.
   - Looking at the answer choices:
     - **A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass** is related to bypassing security features by marking files as coming from the internet. This does not directly relate to sending data from compromised hosts to the attacker.
     - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** involves exfiltrating data using web services, which could align with using HTTP requests for command and control.
     - **C: T1129-Shared Modules** is about using shared modules, which does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
     - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** specifically involves exfiltrating data over an established command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the exfiltration of data after command and control channels have been established.
   - The report mentions the use of HTTP requests to PHP scripts on C2 servers for command and control.
   - Given the context, the most relevant technique for sending data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure after establishing command and control would be exfiltration over the established command and control channel.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

Final Answer: D
