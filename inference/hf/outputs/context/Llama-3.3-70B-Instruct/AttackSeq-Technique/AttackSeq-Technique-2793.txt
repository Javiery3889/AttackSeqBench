To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through compromised systems, leading to the installation of iOS malware.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that can hide its icon, run in the background, and restart after termination on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase outlines the app's capabilities to collect various information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to send collected sensitive information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.
   - The question implies a step after data collection, focusing on the exfiltration or transmission of the collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report details the collection of sensitive information but does not explicitly describe how the data is sent out.
   - However, the question hints at the use of Base64 encoded tokens for data transmission, which is a method of encoding data.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to find the one that best matches the technique of encoding data for transmission.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery** is about discovering the system's location, which doesn't directly relate to sending collected data.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** involves encoding data to hide its contents, which aligns with the use of Base64 encoded tokens for sending sensitive information.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting** is a technique used to hide the true destination of communications, which, while related to evasion, doesn't directly pertain to the encoding of data for transmission.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** is about compromising software dependencies, which is unrelated to the encoding and transmission of collected data.

Given the focus on encoding data for transmission, the most relevant technique to the scenario described in the question is data encoding, as it directly involves modifying data (in this case, encoding it in Base64 with a random prefix) to facilitate its transmission without being detected.

**Final Answer: B**
