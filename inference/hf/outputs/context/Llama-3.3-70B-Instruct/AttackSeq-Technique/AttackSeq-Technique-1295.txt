To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises.
   - **Execution** involves the delivery and execution of the Poison Ivy server code on the target's endpoint.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to automatically restart the Poison Ivy server if it's terminated.
   - **Defense Evasion** involves encrypting network communications using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after establishing persistence to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
   - The key detail here is the establishment of a secure communication channel after persistence is achieved.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after persistence is established (through the watchdog thread in explorer.exe), the attackers would need to secure their communication with the compromised system.
   - The **Defense Evasion** section of the report mentions that Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted, which aligns with the concept of creating a secure or encrypted channel for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP after establishing persistence.
   - The report highlights the use of encryption (Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key) for network communications, which is a method to secure communication channels.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly relates to establishing a secure communication channel, which is essential for the attackers to maintain control over the compromised system without being detected.
   - **T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation** is not relevant to securing communication channels.
   - **T1090-Proxy** could be related to hiding the communication but doesn't directly address the encryption or securing of the communication channel.
   - **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** is more about executing malicious code in response to specific events and does not directly pertain to securing communication channels.

**Final Answer: D**
