To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by two Chinese APT groups, APT3 and APT18, using phishing campaigns that exploit a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119).
   - The phishing emails either redirect to malicious files (for APT3) or prompt the download of a malicious Adobe Flash update (for APT18).
   - The payloads delivered include a SHOTPUT payload (a DLL backdoor) for APT3 and a GH0ST RAT variant for APT18.
   - Both payloads are capable of communicating with command and control (CnC) addresses, with APT3's payload communicating over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses and APT18's payload calling out to a known CnC address.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses after the initial exploitation.
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect post-exploitation, indicating we are looking for a technique related to command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail here is the communication with CnC addresses. The report mentions that the payloads (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT) communicate over HTTP (for SHOTPUT) to hardcoded or known CnC addresses.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control communications. Given that the payloads communicate over HTTP, which is an application layer protocol, this seems highly relevant.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is the initial access technique used by the APT groups but does not relate to post-exploitation CnC communication.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling** involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol for CnC, which is not directly indicated in the report.
   - **T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service** involves disguising a malicious task or service as a legitimate one, which does not directly relate to the communication with CnC addresses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report highlights the use of HTTP for communication with CnC addresses.
   - The question asks for the technique enabling this communication.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique as it involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for CnC communications.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses after exploiting the zero-day vulnerability is related to using an application layer protocol.

Final Answer: A
