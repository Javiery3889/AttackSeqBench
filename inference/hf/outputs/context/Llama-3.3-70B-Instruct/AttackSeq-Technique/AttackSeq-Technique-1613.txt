To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the Lazarus group's attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB), focusing on the execution of malicious software, establishment of persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - Key points include:
     - Execution of loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) and backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
     - Establishment of persistence through a registry key and placement in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Defense evasion tactics such as killing antivirus processes and using a 'Polyglot' file.
     - Lateral movement by copying malware to other devices using hardcoded accounts and passwords.
     - Command and control through backdoor malware communicating with remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the most likely final step in disrupting the bank's operations after the Lazarus group maintained communication with the C&C server.
   - The focus is on the technique used after establishing command and control, specifically looking for an action that would disrupt operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context of disrupting bank operations, we need to consider which technique among the answer choices would be most impactful.
   - **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This involves executing commands indirectly, which could be part of the attack but doesn't directly imply disruption of operations.
   - **B: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves registering or unregistering a COM object, which might be part of the attack but doesn't directly relate to disrupting operations.
   - **C: T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion**: This involves deleting data based on a specific condition, which could disrupt operations but isn't directly mentioned in the report as a final step.
   - **D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: Encrypting data for impact directly disrupts operations by making data inaccessible, which aligns with a final step to significantly affect the bank's ability to operate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used as a final step to disrupt the bank's operations.
   - The report details various tactics but focuses on the execution of malware, establishment of persistence, evasion, movement, and command and control.
   - Disrupting operations would require an action that significantly impacts the bank's ability to function, such as making critical data inaccessible.
   - Encrypting data for impact (T1486) directly aligns with this goal, as it would render the bank's data unusable, thereby disrupting operations.

Final Answer: D
