To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the activities of FIN13, a threat actor targeting Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution.
     4. **Persistence**: Using methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and deploying malware.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizing techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employing passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for evasion.
     7. **Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials through process memory dumping and network sniffing.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI to execute commands remotely.
     9. **Collection**: Collecting data from network shared drives.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using proxies and protocols for command and control.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after lateral movement (via WMI) to gather information on network configuration, supporting FIN13's objectives.
   - The relevant sequence here involves **Lateral Movement** followed by a technique to gather network configuration information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After using WMI for lateral movement, FIN13 would likely need to understand the network configuration to achieve their objectives, such as identifying potential targets for data collection or further lateral movement.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** (Choice C) directly aligns with the need to gather information on network configuration after establishing access and moving laterally within the network. This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which could include network topology, firewall settings, or other configuration details necessary for further operations.
   - **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery** (Choice A) is more specific to discovering internet connections, which, while useful, is not as directly related to understanding the internal network configuration as Choice C.
   - **T1505-Server Software Component** (Choice B) involves discovering server software components, which could be part of network configuration but is more focused on specific software rather than the overall network configuration.
   - **T1078.001-Default Accounts** (Choice D) is related to identifying default accounts, which is more about credential access than network configuration discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given FIN13's objectives and the need to understand the network after lateral movement, the most relevant technique for gathering network configuration information is **System Network Configuration Discovery**.
   - This technique aligns with the requirement to support operational objectives by providing necessary insights into the network layout and potential vulnerabilities or targets.
   - **Final Answer: C**
