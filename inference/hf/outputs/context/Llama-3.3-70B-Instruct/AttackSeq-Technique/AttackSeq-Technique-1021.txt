To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gamaredon group's tactics, starting with **Initial Access** through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution** involves the use of scripting and launching malicious DLLs.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and inserting malicious macros into documents.
   - **Defense Evasion** includes obfuscation, modifying registry keys, and code signing.
   - **Discovery**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, and **Exfiltration** tactics are also described, showing a comprehensive approach to cyber attacks.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the action of injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and then sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this action.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Injecting malicious macros into documents is a method of persistence, as described in the report.
   - Sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization, after compromising a system and potentially using it to spread further, suggests an **Internal Spearphishing** tactic. This is because the attack is leveraging the compromised organization's internal trust and potentially compromised email accounts to spread to other targets within the organization.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The report mentions that Gamaredon "leverages trusted relationships by abusing compromised organization's email accounts to send emails with malicious attachments to the victim's contacts." This indicates a pattern of using internal or compromised accounts to further the attack, which aligns with internal spearphishing.
   - The action of sending emails with malicious attachments after injecting macros into documents suggests a continuation of the attack within the organization, aiming to compromise more systems or users.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing** is the technique that involves spearphishing attacks from a compromised internal account, which fits the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: D**
