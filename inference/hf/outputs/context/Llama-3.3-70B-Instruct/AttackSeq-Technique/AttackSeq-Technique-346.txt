To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses various tactics used by the threat actors involved in the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
   - The sequence of tactics mentioned includes:
     1. Reconnaissance (implied, with a focus on the attackers' knowledge of SolarWinds' internal workings).
     2. Resource Development (selective targeting, acquiring infrastructure).
     3. Initial Access (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, specifically T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain).
     4. Persistence (implied, with the ability to maintain a foothold).
     5. Privilege Escalation (implied, with high-level system access).
     6. Defense Evasion (various techniques to avoid detection).
     7. Credential Access (use of valid accounts).
     8. Discovery (T1057 Process Discovery, T1012 Query Registry).
     9. Lateral Movement (implied, moving through the network).
     10. Collection (focused on information theft and espionage).
     11. Command and Control (T1071 Application Layer Protocol, T1568 Dynamic Resolution).
     12. Exfiltration (implied, stealing data).
     13. Impact (primarily espionage, not destruction).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gaining initial access through a compromised software update, specifically when the threat actors executed code using system services.
   - The key detail here is the execution of code using system services after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial access was through a supply chain compromise (a software update), the next logical step would involve executing malicious code within the compromised system.
   - The question specifically mentions executing code using system services, which directly points to the use of system services for malicious purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** was achieved through a compromised software update (T1195.002).
   - The question asks for the technique used after this initial access, specifically related to executing code using system services.
   - **T1569-System Services** directly involves using system services to execute commands or code, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - Other options, while relevant to the broader context of the attack, do not directly relate to the specific action of executing code using system services after initial access.

**Final Answer**: D
