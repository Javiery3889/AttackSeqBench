To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** via spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the use of malware, specifically the XtremeRat backdoor trojan, which is disguised as documents (e.g., '.doc.scr') and is digitally signed to appear legitimate.
   - **Command and Control** involves communication with C&C servers hosted on DynDNS services.
   - The report also mentions that the malware was signed with a digital certificate that appeared to be from Microsoft but was actually untrusted and faked.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used after disguising malware as documents and utilizing XtremeRat, to make the malware appear legitimate and evade detection.
   - The key detail here is the use of digital signatures to make the malware appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report highlights the use of fake digital certificates (appearing to be from Microsoft) to sign the malware, making it seem legitimate.
   - Among the answer choices, **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** directly relates to the use of fake or stolen certificates to make malicious files appear trustworthy. This technique involves manipulating the trust mechanisms used by the operating system or applications to make malicious files seem legitimate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used to make the malware appear legitimate after it has been disguised as a document.
   - The use of a fake digital certificate from a trusted entity like Microsoft directly aligns with subverting trust controls.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves using fake digital certificates to subvert trust controls, making the malware seem legitimate and increasing the chances of it evading detection.

Final Answer: B
