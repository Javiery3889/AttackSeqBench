To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence of Volatile Cedar, starting with **Reconnaissance** (vulnerability scan), followed by **Initial Access** (exploiting vulnerabilities to inject web shell code), **Execution** (using the Explosive Trojan), **Persistence** (installing the Trojan with various service names and paths), **Defense Evasion** (hiding from detection tools), **Credential Access** (using keylogging to gain administrator passwords), and **Lateral Movement** (spreading to the entire network).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs after Volatile Cedar leverages keylogging capabilities for credential access, as the campaign connects with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems.
   - The key detail here is the use of keylogging for credential access and the subsequent connection to control targeted systems, which implies a need to communicate with or manipulate the targeted systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - After gaining credential access via keylogging, the attackers would likely use the obtained credentials to interact with the targeted systems, potentially to execute commands, transfer files, or manipulate data.
   - The correct answer should reflect the technique used to interact with or control the targeted systems over the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** (A) refers to exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which is an initial access technique, not directly related to post-credential access activities.
   - **T1497.001-System Checks** (B) involves checking system information, which might be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly relate to controlling targeted systems after credential access.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation** (C) is about making data difficult to understand, which is a defense evasion technique and not directly related to interacting with or controlling systems.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** (D) involves using application layer protocols to communicate with systems, which could be relevant for controlling targeted systems after obtaining credentials.

Given the context of connecting with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems after leveraging keylogging capabilities for credential access, the most appropriate technique would involve using application layer protocols to communicate with or control the targeted systems.

**Final Answer: D**
