To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where attackers modified the MiMi chat application installers with malicious JavaScript code.
   - The malicious code downloads and executes the rshell executable, a backdoor that communicates with a command and control (C&C) server.
   - The attack involves Defense Evasion and Command and Control tactics.
   - The report mentions that the malicious versions of the chat installer were unsigned, requiring users to bypass macOS security warnings.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with compromising the MiMi chat application's installers.
   - This is followed by the deployment of malicious JavaScript code for Defense Evasion.
   - The code then downloads and executes the rshell executable, establishing Command and Control.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely preceded the deployment of malicious JavaScript code, enabling Iron Tiger to compromise MiMi's servers and inject backdoors during the application build process.
   - The question focuses on the initial compromise that allowed the attackers to modify the application installers.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of a target organization, which could include modifying software or applications before they are delivered to the end-user. This would fit the scenario where the attackers were able to modify the MiMi chat application installers before they were downloaded by users.
   - **T1659-Content Injection**: While content injection could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly imply the initial compromise of the application's build process or the supply chain.
   - **T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**: This technique involves modifying or adding a helper DLL to access the network, which doesn't directly relate to the initial compromise of the application's installers.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves manipulating application layer protocols, which is not directly related to the initial compromise of the application build process.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that allowed Iron Tiger to compromise MiMi's servers and inject backdoors during the application build process.
   - The supply chain compromise (T1195) is the most fitting technique because it involves tampering with a product or its delivery mechanism before it reaches the end-user, which aligns with the scenario of modifying the MiMi chat application installers.
   - The other options do not directly address the initial compromise of the application's build process or supply chain.

**Final Answer: A**
