To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via a malicious email with a Microsoft Word attachment containing an embedded .LNK object.
   - Upon execution, this object runs a PowerShell script that downloads and injects the 9002 RAT shellcode into the legitimate Windows Mail binary wabmig.exe.
   - The report also mentions **Defense Evasion** techniques, including communication over HTTP and fake SSL, and **Command and Control** via HTTP POST requests with encoded data.
   - Importantly, for persistence, a .LNK file named UpdateCheck.lnk is stored in the Startup directory. This file contains a PowerShell script that opens, decodes, and injects the already downloaded shellcode into a newly created wabmig.exe process upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to ensure the RAT remains active even after system restarts, following the injection of shellcode into wabmig.exe.
   - The key detail here is the mechanism used to maintain persistence across system restarts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of a .LNK file (UpdateCheck.lnk) placed in the Startup directory. This is a clear indicator of a technique used to achieve persistence.
   - The ATT&CK framework includes several techniques related to persistence, but the one that directly involves placing files in startup locations to execute upon system boot or user logon is **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.
   - The other options do not directly relate to maintaining persistence across system restarts:
     - **T1566 - Phishing** is related to the initial access vector (the malicious email), not persistence.
     - **T1098.002 - Additional Email Delegate Permissions** is about gaining additional permissions within an email system, not about persistence on a compromised system.
     - **T1574.006 - Dynamic Linker Hijacking** is a technique related to hijacking dynamic link libraries, which is not mentioned in the report as a method for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report details an attack where a .LNK file is used to maintain persistence by executing a PowerShell script that injects RAT shellcode into a process upon system startup.
   - This action directly aligns with the ATT&CK technique **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**, which involves executing processes automatically at boot or logon.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for ensuring the RAT remains active after system restarts involves using **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: A
