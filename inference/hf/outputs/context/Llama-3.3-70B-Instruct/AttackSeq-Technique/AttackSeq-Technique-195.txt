To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by FamousSparrow, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration.
   - Key points relevant to the question include the use of SparrowDoor for various purposes, including data collection and exfiltration, and the establishment of a command and control (C&C) channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used when SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server, specifically after data collection and before exfiltration.
   - The question focuses on the communication method used between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that FamousSparrow exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor, indicating that the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server is crucial for exfiltration.
   - Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify the technique that best matches the method of communication or data transfer between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server for data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique is about determining the physical location of a device, which is not relevant to the communication method for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel for communication, which is plausible given that the report mentions encrypted shellcode and the need for secure communication for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel another protocol, which could be relevant but is less directly related to the simple act of establishing an encrypted communication channel for exfiltration.

Given the context that the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server involves exfiltrating collected data and considering the emphasis on encrypted shellcode and secure communication methods, the most likely technique used for this purpose would be establishing an encrypted channel to protect the data being exfiltrated.

**Final Answer: C**
