To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through the exploitation of a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
   - The actors then used the webshell for **Execution** of various commands and uploading tools.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques were employed to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access** was gained using Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Discovery** activities were conducted to understand the system and network.
   - **Command and Control** was established using the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after gaining credential access, specifically when the actors used webshells and dumped credentials to execute commands on other systems within the network.
   - The key elements here are the use of webshells, dumped credentials, and the execution of commands on other systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that after gaining **Credential Access**, the actors used the obtained credentials to run commands on other systems, which implies remote access to these systems.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of webshells and dumped credentials for executing commands on other systems, which aligns with using credentials to access remote services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The actors gained access to credentials using Mimikatz and Impacket tools.
   - They used these credentials for pass-the-hash attacks, which allows them to access other systems without needing the actual password.
   - The use of webshells (like AntSword) facilitated the execution of commands on the compromised server and potentially on other systems within the network.
   - Given this context, the technique that best matches the execution of commands on other systems within the network using obtained credentials is related to accessing remote services.

Considering the above analysis, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is **T1021-Remote Services**, as it involves using credentials to access and execute commands on remote systems, which aligns with the actions described in the report and the question.

**Final Answer: C**
