To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Whitefly's attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing emails containing a dropper that executes a loader named Trojan.Vcrodat.
   - After initial access, the tactics include **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Discovery**, **Lateral Movement**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, and **Exfiltration**.
   - The key detail here is the execution of Trojan.Vcrodat and the subsequent actions to gain elevated privileges.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken by Whitefly after gaining initial access, specifically how the loader Trojan.Vcrodat executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after initial access, Whitefly aims to maintain long-term access and deploys tools for ongoing communication and control, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities and using tools like Mimikatz for privilege escalation.
   - The specific action of executing malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges is related to **Privilege Escalation** and **Defense Evasion** tactics.
   - Among the answer choices, we need to find the one that best aligns with the execution of malicious DLLs for gaining elevated privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **A: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves compromising a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in a web browser or its plugins, which does not directly relate to the execution of malicious DLLs by Trojan.Vcrodat.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique is about discovering remote systems, which is not directly related to the execution of malicious DLLs for privilege escalation.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves executing malicious DLLs, which can be used to evade detection and potentially gain elevated privileges by hijacking the search order, as mentioned in the report under **Defense Evasion**.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about using software deployment tools to deploy malware, which, while relevant to the deployment of tools, does not specifically address the execution of malicious DLLs for privilege escalation.

Given the details in the report and the question, the most relevant technique related to the execution of malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges is **T1129-Shared Modules**, as it directly involves the use of malicious DLLs, which can be part of the **Defense Evasion** and **Privilege Escalation** tactics described.

**Final Answer: C**
