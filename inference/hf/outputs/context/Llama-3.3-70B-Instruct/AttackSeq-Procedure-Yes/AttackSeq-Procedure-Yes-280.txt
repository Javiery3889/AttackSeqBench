To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document that, upon opening, downloads an external template containing VBA macros. These macros decrypt and drop two files: a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') and a base64 encoded PowerShell code ('sdmc.jpg').
   - **Execution:** The PowerShell script decodes and executes another script stored in 'sdmc.jpg', which downloads a zip file containing image files used to generate the malware payload. The payload is assembled from these images and executed.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers use various techniques, including switching the malicious template to a benign one, generating the malware payload from image files, and signing the payload with valid certificates to appear trustworthy.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using image files for concealment during Defense Evasion, the Bandook campaign is likely to use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload before employing AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report details the use of image files to conceal malicious components as part of the Defense Evasion phase, which aligns with the premise of the question.
   - However, the report does not explicitly mention the use of Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload or the use of AES encryption for communication with the C&C server. The execution phase involves downloading and executing scripts and payloads, but the specifics of Process Hollowing or AES encryption for C&C communication are not mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Bandook campaign's methods for initial access, execution, and defense evasion are detailed, focusing on the use of malicious documents, scripts, and image files to evade detection and deliver the payload.
   - The question introduces techniques (Process Hollowing and AES encryption for C&C communication) not explicitly covered in the provided CTI report.
   - Given the information in the report, there's no direct evidence to support the claim that the Bandook campaign uses Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer or employs AES encryption for C&C communication as part of its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

**Final Answer: B**
