To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that starts with an **Initial Access** tactic via a spear-phishing campaign, using malicious MS Office documents to deliver a macro that downloads malicious payloads, including the 'Remote Manipulator System' (RMS) tool.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the macro executing and downloading additional payloads, including the RMS tool.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by adding a registry key to launch the RMS executable on user login and attempting to kill a specific process to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion** is facilitated by the use of the legitimate RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement, allowing the threat actors to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement, it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server located in Germany using application layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the initial payload downloaded from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure often masqueraded as legitimate-looking domains but does not specify the location of these C2 servers.
   - The report does not explicitly mention communication with a C2 server in Germany or the use of application layer protocols for such communication.
   - However, given that the threat actors utilized the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement, and considering typical C2 communication patterns, it's plausible that the RMS executable would need to communicate with a C2 server for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
   - The question introduces new information (C2 server in Germany, application layer protocols) not directly mentioned in the report, requiring an inference based on typical attack patterns.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details the use of the RMS tool for evasion and movement within the network.
   - Typical C2 communication involves the use of various protocols, including those at the application layer, to receive commands or send stolen data.
   - While the report does not specify the location of C2 servers or the protocols used, the scenario described in the question (communication with a C2 server) aligns with common post-exploitation activities.
   - Given the information provided and typical attack patterns, it's reasonable to infer that communication with a C2 server could occur, but the specifics (location in Germany, use of application layer protocols) are not directly supported by the report.

**Final Answer: A**
