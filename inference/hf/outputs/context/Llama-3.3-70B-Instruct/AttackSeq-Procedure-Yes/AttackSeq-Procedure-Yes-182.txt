To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Infamous Chisel, a malware collection targeting Android devices, associated with Sandworm activity.
   - **Execution**: Infamous Chisel executes as the root user, replacing the legitimate netd and inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence**: It persists by replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Achieved by replacing netd and being executed by init.
   - **Defense Evasion**: It decompresses executables and checks its execution context to evade defenses.
   - **Discovery**: The netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS and system information, and performs IP scanning.
   - **Collection**: Automatically collects files based on predefined extensions and from application directories.
   - **Command and Control**: Utilizes SCP, Tor hidden services, and SSH for communication.
   - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates files at regular intervals using Tor and SSH.
   - **Impact**: Replaces the legitimate netd, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after discovering files of interest and collecting information, Infamous Chisel is likely to deploy tcpdump to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic before exfiltrating files.
   - The key activities mentioned are discovery, potential network traffic monitoring using tcpdump, and exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details various capabilities of Infamous Chisel, including discovery, collection, and exfiltration of data.
   - It mentions the use of nmap for network scanning but does not explicitly mention the use of tcpdump for sniffing network interfaces.
   - However, the report does indicate a broad range of network-related activities, including IP scanning and the use of network tools like nmap, suggesting an interest in network reconnaissance.
   - The question implies a sequence where after discovering files and collecting information, the malware might engage in more detailed network monitoring (using tcpdump) before exfiltrating data.
   - Given the malware's focus on collecting and exfiltrating data, and its use of various network tools, it's plausible that detailed network monitoring could be part of its capabilities, even if not explicitly stated.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary activities of Infamous Chisel mentioned in the CTI report, which include discovery, collection, and exfiltration of data.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the network-related tools and activities mentioned, such as nmap and IP scanning.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of tcpdump deployment for network monitoring given the malware's network-focused activities.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis. While the report does not explicitly mention tcpdump, the malware's comprehensive approach to data collection and exfiltration, combined with its network reconnaissance capabilities, makes it plausible that it could engage in detailed network monitoring.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the focus on network activities, the most likely answer, based on the steps of reasoning, would lean towards the affirmative, considering the malware's broad capabilities in network reconnaissance and data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
