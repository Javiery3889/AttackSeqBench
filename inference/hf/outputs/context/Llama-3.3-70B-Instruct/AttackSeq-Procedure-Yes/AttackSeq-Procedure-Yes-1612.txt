To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the Lazarus group's attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB), focusing on the execution of malicious software, establishment of persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - Key points include:
     - Deployment of a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) for persistence and antivirus evasion.
     - Use of a 'Polyglot' file to hide and execute malware.
     - Utilization of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control, packed with Themida for evasion.
     - Lateral movement through hardcoded user accounts and IP addresses.
     - Communication with command and control servers for remote command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing command and control, the Lazarus group likely deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and leave ransom notes.
   - The question implies a sequence where command and control establishment is followed by potential ransomware deployment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or the use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm for file encryption.
   - The report focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control but does not detail ransomware deployment as part of the attack sequence.
   - The use of backdoor malware for command and control suggests the attackers had the capability to execute various commands, potentially including deploying additional malware. However, the report does not specify ransomware deployment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the main actions described in the CTI report, which include malware deployment, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question posits a specific action (deployment of Hermes ransomware) not explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities demonstrated by the attackers, including command and control, which could theoretically facilitate ransomware deployment.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided and the typical behaviors of the Lazarus group.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or similar activities post-command and control establishment, and considering the report's focus on other aspects of the attack, the most accurate answer based on the provided information would lean towards the action not being directly mentioned or implied as a follow-up to command and control.

Final Answer: B
