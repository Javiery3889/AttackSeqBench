To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The FHAPPI campaign starts with an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware is a VBScript encoded script that, when executed, downloads and opens a .doc file.
   - The opening of the .doc file leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.
   - The campaign utilizes multiple encodings and wraps, including multilayered base64 encoding, for defense evasion.
   - The malware communicates with a C2 server and is capable of various malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the initial infection vector (phishing email leading to the execution of a VBScript that opens a .doc file), it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the campaign uses multilayered base64 encoding for defense evasion, which implies that base64 encoding is part of the attack's strategy to avoid detection.
   - It also mentions that the execution of the .doc file leads to a PowerShell attack, indicating that PowerShell is indeed used for further execution within the victim's system.
   - Given that the attack involves PowerShell and utilizes base64 encoding for evasion, it is reasonable to infer that the PowerShell command could run base64 encoded code as part of its execution, especially since the goal is to remain stealthy and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial attack vector and its outcome. The phishing email leads to the execution of a VBScript, which then downloads and opens a .doc file.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the role of PowerShell in the attack. The .doc file's execution leads to a PowerShell attack, indicating PowerShell's use in the campaign.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the use of base64 encoding. The campaign employs multilayered base64 encoding for defense evasion, suggesting its use in various stages of the attack, potentially including the PowerShell execution.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of PowerShell running base64 encoded code for further execution. Given the campaign's use of PowerShell and base64 encoding, it is plausible that PowerShell commands would run base64 encoded code to maintain stealth and achieve the attack's objectives.
