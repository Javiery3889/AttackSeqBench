To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the "Machete" malware, which is distributed through social engineering tactics.
   - Initial Access is gained via spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website, with the malware embedded in PowerPoint presentations.
   - Persistence is achieved by creating a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/', along with creating a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - The report mentions various indicators of compromise, including suspicious domains and infection artifacts.
   - It also notes the malware's unusual use of Python embedded into Windows executables.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after achieving persistence, Machete is likely to copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities.
   - The question focuses on the behavior of the malware post-persistence, specifically regarding data collection and exfiltration methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on how the malware gains initial access and achieves persistence but does not explicitly mention the use of USB devices for data exfiltration or collection.
   - The report highlights the malware's capabilities, including its installation and persistence mechanisms, but does not specify actions related to copying files to USB devices.
   - Given the context, the question about copying files to a special USB device as part of collection capabilities requires an understanding of typical malware behaviors post-persistence. Malware often seeks to exfiltrate data, and using a USB device could be a method, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the malware's known behaviors from the report, which include social engineering for initial access and specific persistence mechanisms.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question asks about a specific behavior (copying files to a USB device) not explicitly covered in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider typical malware behaviors post-persistence, which can include data exfiltration through various means, including potentially USB devices.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not provide direct evidence or mention of Machete using USB devices for data collection, and given the focus on the malware's described capabilities, we must infer based on common malware behaviors and the information provided.
   - **Conclusion**: The report does not explicitly state that Machete copies files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities. Therefore, without direct evidence from the report, the most cautious and informed answer based on the provided details would lean towards the behavior not being explicitly mentioned or implied as a primary or known capability of the malware.

Final Answer: B
