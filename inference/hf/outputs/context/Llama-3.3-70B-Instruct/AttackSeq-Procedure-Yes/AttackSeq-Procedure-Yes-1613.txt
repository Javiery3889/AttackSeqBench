To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the Lazarus group's attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB), focusing on the execution of malicious software, establishment of persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - Key points include:
     - Deployment of a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) for persistence and antivirus evasion.
     - Use of a 'Polyglot' file to hide and execute malware.
     - Utilization of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control.
     - Lateral movement through hardcoded user accounts and IP addresses.
     - Communication with command and control servers for remote command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing command and control and executing remote commands, the Lazarus group likely deployed Hermes ransomware to disrupt the bank's operations.
   - The question implies a sequence of events: 
     1. Establishment of command and control.
     2. Execution of remote commands.
     3. Potential deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or the specific actions of deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files as part of the attack on FEIB.
   - The report focuses on the execution of malicious software, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and command and control, which are all tactics used by the Lazarus group during the heist.
   - The question introduces an action (deploying Hermes ransomware) not directly mentioned in the report but is a known tactic used by threat actors to disrupt operations and extort money.
   - Given the context of the FEIB heist, which included unauthorized transfers via the SWIFT network and the arrest of individuals related to cashing out transferred funds, the primary goal appears to be financial gain rather than purely disruptive activities like ransomware deployment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goals and tactics mentioned in the CTI report, which are focused on executing malicious software, maintaining access, evading detection, moving laterally, and controlling compromised systems.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the introduction of Hermes ransomware as a potential tactic for disrupting operations, which aligns with known threat actor behaviors but is not explicitly mentioned in the provided CTI report.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of the Lazarus group deploying Hermes ransomware based on the report's details and the typical goals of such attacks. The report emphasizes financial gain through unauthorized transfers rather than disruptive ransomware attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report and the typical behaviors of the Lazarus group, there is no direct evidence to suggest the deployment of Hermes ransomware as part of the FEIB heist. The question introduces a scenario not supported by the report's details.

Final Answer: B
