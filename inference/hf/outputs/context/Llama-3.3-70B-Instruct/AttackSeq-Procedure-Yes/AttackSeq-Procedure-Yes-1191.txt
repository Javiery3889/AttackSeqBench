To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors used a spear-phishing campaign with malicious MS Office documents to gain initial access. The documents instructed victims to disable security controls, allowing a macro to execute and download malicious payloads, including the RMS tool.
   - **Execution:** The macro executed, downloading payloads from the C2 infrastructure, which were disguised as legitimate domains. The initial payload was a malware downloader that gathered further components.
   - **Persistence:** A second-stage shell script added a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows registry to launch the RMS executable at user logon, ensuring persistence. The RMS executable was used before attempting to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process, causing the script to loop.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The RMS tool was used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, evading detection by utilizing a legitimate remote administration tool.
   - **Others:** Provides context about the threat actor TA505, their history, and the use of RMS in various campaigns.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after obtaining persistence and using the RMS executable for evasion during reconnaissance and lateral movement, it is likely that the RMS executable will attempt to connect to a C2 server in Germany and if TA505 will use the ServHelper backdoor during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report does not specifically mention the RMS executable attempting to connect to a C2 server located in Germany. It mentions that the initial payload downloads from the C2 infrastructure, which masquerades as legitimate-looking domains, but it does not specify the location of these C2 servers.
   - The report also does not mention the use of the ServHelper backdoor by TA505 during the Command and Control phase. It discusses the use of the RMS tool for evasion and persistence but does not detail the specific backdoors used.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question introduces new information not directly supported by the CTI report, such as the connection to a C2 server in Germany and the use of the ServHelper backdoor.
   - The report focuses on the use of RMS for initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion but does not provide details on the specific C2 server locations or the use of ServHelper.
   - Given the information provided in the CTI report, we cannot confirm the specifics of the C2 server's location or the use of the ServHelper backdoor as part of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
