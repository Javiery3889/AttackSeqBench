To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used Telegram channels to distribute Raccoon stealer, exploiting Telegram's legitimate features. They also used phishing pages and mailings with malicious macros.
   - **Execution:** Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, autofill form details, and scans for valid crypto wallets.
   - **Command and Control:** Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram's legitimate features to avoid detection. The C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through a specific Telegram channel.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting system, account, and crypto wallet data, Raccoon stealer would likely make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The report indicates that the attackers used Telegram channels for distributing malware and for C&C communication, leveraging Telegram's features to avoid detection.
   - The question essentially describes a scenario where the malware (Raccoon stealer) needs to obtain the addresses of the C&C servers in a way that helps in Defense Evasion, which aligns with the report's mention of using Telegram for distributing encrypted C&C servers to bypass blocking.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' use of Telegram for both malware distribution and C&C communication suggests a reliance on Telegram's platform for operational security and evasion.
   - The need for the malware to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers directly aligns with the tactics described, where Telegram is used to distribute these servers to avoid detection.
   - Given that the malware collects sensitive data and then would logically need to communicate this back to the attackers, using Telegram to receive C&C server addresses for encrypted communication fits the described modus operandi.
   - The question's scenario of making network requests to a Telegram channel for C&C server addresses before communicating with these servers using Telegram features is consistent with the tactics outlined in the report.

**Final Answer: A**
