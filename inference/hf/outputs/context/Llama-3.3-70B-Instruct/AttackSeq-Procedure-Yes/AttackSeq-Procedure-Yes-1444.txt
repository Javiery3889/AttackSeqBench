To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Taidoor malware campaign, which starts with spear-phishing emails containing attachments that exploit a Microsoft Office vulnerability to install malware.
   - The malware beacons to a command-and-control (CnC) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
   - The report mentions that Taidoor has evolved to avoid detection by using a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware.
   - It also notes changes in network traffic patterns to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the Taidoor malware avoids detection by using a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself, it is likely to communicate with specific command-and-control servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw).
   - The question focuses on the communication behavior of the new Taidoor variant after it has evolved to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the domains "roudan.serveftp.com" and "mac.gov.hpc.tw" as CnC servers used by the Taidoor malware.
   - However, it does mention that the malware beacons to a CnC server and that there have been changes in its communication patterns to avoid detection.
   - The report also mentions a connection between various activities using Taidoor and notes similarities with another malware family, 'Taleret,' in terms of CnC server communication techniques and naming schemes.
   - Given that the question asks about the likelihood of communication with specific CnC servers after the malware has evolved, we must consider whether the evolution of the malware to avoid detection implies a change in CnC servers or communication patterns.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Taidoor malware's evolution to avoid detection includes changes in its network traffic pattern, which could imply changes in how it communicates with CnC servers.
   - **Step 2**: The report does not provide explicit information about the specific CnC servers "roudan.serveftp.com" and "mac.gov.hpc.tw" being used by the new variant of Taidoor.
   - **Step 3**: The question's context suggests that the new variant's communication behavior might differ from previous patterns due to its evolution.
   - **Step 4**: Without explicit information linking the new variant to the specified CnC servers, we must consider the general behavior of malware evolution and the intent to evade detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the focus on evasion techniques, it's plausible that the new variant could use different or additional CnC servers as part of its evasion strategy. However, the report does not directly support the conclusion that it would specifically use "roudan.serveftp.com" and "mac.gov.hpc.tw."

Final Answer: B
