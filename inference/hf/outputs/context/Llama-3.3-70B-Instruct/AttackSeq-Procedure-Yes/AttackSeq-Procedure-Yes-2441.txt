To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence by the DRAGONFISH threat group using the Elise malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: The malware is distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes, injects a DLL into the Internet Explorer process, and calls an export function. It creates a mutex to prevent duplicate executions and stores harvested data locally.
     3. **Persistence**: The malware achieves persistence through the Run Registry key and injects hidden DLLs into iexplore.exe.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs various evasion techniques, including anti-VM features, obfuscation, and spoofing.
     5. **Discovery**: The malware harvests extensive system information.
   - Key points relevant to the question include the malware's ability to send data to and download files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information for discovery purposes, the Elise malware is likely to communicate with the hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect of the malware's behavior post-discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know the malware collects system information (Discovery phase) and then sends this data to a C2 server.
   - The report explicitly mentions that the malware "sends data to and downloads files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server with the IP address 103.236.150[.]14."
   - This indicates that after collecting system information, the malware indeed communicates with the C2 server, which is a typical behavior for Command and Control (C2) communication in malware operations.
   - The use of an application layer protocol (like HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) for C2 communication is common in malware to blend in with normal network traffic, although the specific protocol is not mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the malware's behavior post-discovery, which includes sending collected data to a C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that C2 communication typically involves the use of application layer protocols to facilitate command and control operations.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report confirms communication with a C2 server and given the context of malware operations, it is reasonable to infer that this communication would utilize an application layer protocol.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report and understanding of typical malware C2 communication methods, the most plausible answer is that the malware would communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol after collecting system information.

Final Answer: A
