To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the APT28 threat group using a malicious Word document.
   - The document leverages the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell.
   - PowerShell is used to execute two commands: one downloads a string from a URL and executes it as an encoded command, and the other, also encoded, downloads a file from a URL and sets up persistence mechanisms.
   - The document is used to download and install the Seduploader malware, which is a first-stage reconnaissance implant.
   - The Seduploader collects host information and, if the system is of interest, can lead to the installation of further malware like X-Agent or Sedreco.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands, it is likely that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.
   - The key elements here are the use of DDE, invocation of PowerShell, execution of encoded commands, and the potential contact with a control server for malware distribution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know the malicious document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell, which then downloads and executes commands, including those that lead to the installation of Seduploader.
   - The report explicitly mentions that the document downloads a version of the Seduploader first-stage reconnaissance implant, indicating communication with a control server or a distribution site for the malware.
   - The Seduploader's role in profiling the victim's system and potentially leading to further malware installation (like X-Agent or Sedreco) suggests a multi-stage command and control operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details the use of a malicious Word document leveraging the DDE technique to execute PowerShell commands.
   - These commands lead to the download and execution of the Seduploader malware, which is a first-stage implant in a potentially multi-stage attack.
   - The Seduploader's purpose is to gather system information, which would be sent back to the attackers, implying communication with a control server.
   - Given the Seduploader's role in a multi-stage attack and its need to communicate with command and control servers for further instructions or to exfiltrate data, it is reasonable to conclude that after the initial infection, the malware would indeed contact a control server.

**Final Answer: A**
