To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Sednit group (APT28) that starts with a spearphishing campaign leading to the execution of a downloader.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing campaign leading to the execution of malware.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes, leading to the download and execution of additional malware components, including a backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: The attackers use COM object hijacking to maintain access.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Malware deletes files and kills processes to evade detection.
     5. **Credential Access**: The attackers use dumpers to access credentials.
     6. **Discovery**: The attackers gather information about the victim's environment.
     7. **Collection**: The malware scans for and stages files for exfiltration.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Data is prepared and sent to a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the **Exfiltration** phase, specifically asking if data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that during the **Exfiltration** phase, data are sent to the C&C server after being hex-encoded and encrypted.
   - It does not explicitly mention the use of commonly used ports for the primary C&C server or the specifics of a fallback C&C server's operation.
   - However, the question implies a sequence where the primary method of communication is attempted first (using commonly used ports) before potentially falling back to an alternative method or server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report details a sophisticated attack with multiple components and evasion techniques, suggesting a level of complexity that could include redundant communication methods.
   - The question's focus on the sequence of exfiltration attempts (primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback) aligns with common practices in malware design to ensure reliable command and control.
   - Given the attackers' demonstrated capability for sophisticated operations, including encryption and evasion techniques, it's reasonable to infer they would also implement redundant communication strategies.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware is designed to attempt communication with a primary C&C server over commonly used ports before resorting to a fallback server, especially considering the emphasis on reliability in command and control operations.

Final Answer: A
