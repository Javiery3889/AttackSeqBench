To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing emails containing malicious DOCX documents.
   - The sequence proceeds to **Execution**, where vulnerabilities are exploited to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence** is established through a scheduled task.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery** involves gathering information about the victim's computer.
   - **Collection** of a wide range of data from the victim's system is facilitated by the backdoor.
   - **Command and Control** communication is encrypted and involves sending and receiving specific messages.
   - **Exfiltration** of data occurs over the C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after exfiltrating data, the backdoor is likely to shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details a sophisticated attack aimed at surveillance and data collection, with a focus on maintaining access and gathering information without detection.
   - The report does not mention any intent or capability of the backdoor to shut down the victim's computer. Instead, it highlights the backdoor's ability to collect and exfiltrate data, suggesting a primary goal of espionage rather than disruption.
   - Shutting down the victim's computer would likely alert the victim to the attack and potentially disrupt the attackers' ability to continue collecting data, which contradicts the surveillance objectives outlined in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack's primary objectives, as described, focus on surveillance and data collection.
   - The backdoor's capabilities are centered around maintaining access, collecting data, and exfiltrating it without detection.
   - Disrupting the system by shutting down the computer would not align with the attackers' goals of ongoing surveillance and data collection.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report and the objectives of the attack, it is unlikely that the backdoor would be designed to shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: B
