To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that 'Energetic Bear' compromised a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack, which was then used in a watering hole attack to target individuals associated with Turkish critical infrastructure. The attackers used SMB credential-harvesting malware.
   - **Credential Access:** The group used SMB credential-harvesting malware as part of their credential access strategy, observed in the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website.
   - **Others:** Provides context about the broader targeting strategy of 'Energetic Bear', including the compromise of general-purpose websites related to the critical infrastructure sector.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that 'Energetic Bear' will compromise a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack targeting Turkish critical infrastructure after targeting software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The key elements in the question are the supply chain attack, watering hole attack, targeting Turkish critical infrastructure, and the specific action of targeting software suppliers for PLC components during reconnaissance.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report already describes 'Energetic Bear' using a supply chain attack to compromise a Turkish energy company's website for a watering hole attack, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - The report does not specifically mention targeting software suppliers for PLC components during the reconnaissance phase. However, it does indicate a pattern of targeting news and information websites for the industrial sector, suggesting a broad interest in critical infrastructure.
   - Given 'Energetic Bear's' demonstrated interest in critical infrastructure and their use of supply chain attacks for watering hole attacks, it's plausible they would continue such tactics, including potentially targeting software suppliers as part of their reconnaissance to eventually compromise critical infrastructure targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the tactics already used by 'Energetic Bear' as per the CTI report, which include supply chain attacks and watering hole attacks against critical infrastructure targets.
   - **Step 2:** Consider the plausibility of 'Energetic Bear' expanding their targeting to include software suppliers for PLC components as part of their reconnaissance, given their interest in critical infrastructure.
   - **Step 3:** Evaluate the likelihood of 'Energetic Bear' using a supply chain attack to compromise a Turkish energy company's website for a watering hole attack, considering their past actions and interests.
   - **Conclusion:** Given 'Energetic Bear's' past tactics and interests, it is plausible that they would continue to use supply chain attacks, including targeting software suppliers as part of their reconnaissance, to eventually conduct watering hole attacks against Turkish critical infrastructure.

Final Answer: A
