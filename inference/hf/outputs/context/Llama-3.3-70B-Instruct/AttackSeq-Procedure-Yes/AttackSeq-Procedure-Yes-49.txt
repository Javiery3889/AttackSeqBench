To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - These emails deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware upon successful execution.
   - The initial access is through phishing emails with a Microsoft Word document containing VBS macros.
   - A PowerShell script is executed by the macro, operating in memory to avoid detection.
   - The script downloads payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) from hardcoded command and control (C2) servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access via phishing emails with a malicious Word document, it's likely that an encoded PowerShell script (retrieved via a VBS macro) will execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - The question essentially asks to confirm the sequence of events described in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the PowerShell script, executed by the VBS macro, downloads and executes GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
   - The report details the mechanism of how the script operates in memory, uses .Net Webclient to download payloads, and communicates with C2 servers.
   - Given this information, it is logical to conclude that the sequence of events described in the question aligns with the attack sequence outlined in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access vector - Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the action of the VBS macro - Executes a PowerShell script.
   - **Step 3**: Understand the behavior of the PowerShell script - Operates in memory, downloads payloads from C2 servers.
   - **Step 4**: Identify the payloads - Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is highly likely that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro from a phishing email, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Final Answer: A
