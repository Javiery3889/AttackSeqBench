To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access**: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability, leading to spawning new PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts, culminating in the installation of a malicious DLL.
   - **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - Other tactics include **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Discovery**, **Command and Control**, and **Exfiltration**.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access, it is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a registry-based service named msupdate2.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves executing PowerShell scripts, downloading and running additional files, and then ensuring persistence through the Milestone backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report states that after initial access, Deep Panda spawns new PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts, which ultimately leads to the installation of a malicious DLL (the Milestone backdoor).
   - The report specifically mentions that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry, which aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - The use of PowerShell for initial script execution and the subsequent installation of the Milestone backdoor for persistence directly supports the sequence of events outlined in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Deep Panda gains initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Step 2**: They use this access to spawn new PowerShell processes for downloading and executing scripts.
   - **Step 3**: These scripts lead to the installation of the Milestone backdoor.
   - **Step 4**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a registry service.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, the sequence of events described in the question (executing PowerShell scripts, downloading and running additional files, and then ensuring persistence through the Milestone backdoor) is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to Deep Panda in the report.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Deep Panda would follow this sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
