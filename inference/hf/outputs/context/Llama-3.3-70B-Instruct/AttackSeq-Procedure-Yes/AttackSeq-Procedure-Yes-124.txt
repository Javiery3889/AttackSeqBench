To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Agrius' tactics starting with **Initial Access** through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Execution** involves deploying custom malware like the '.NET backdoor' named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics include using obfuscated webshells and the backdoor's ability to update itself and delete traces.
   - **Lateral Movement** is facilitated by webshells tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts.
   - **Command and Control** involves the 'IPsec Helper' communicating with C2 servers over HTTP for various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication and actions like updating relays or downloading files, it's likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' (later turned into functioning ransomware) to destroy data on targeted systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details Agrius' capabilities and tactics, including the use of custom malware for exfiltration and the ability to deploy additional malware.
   - The question implies a progression from using the 'IPsec Helper' for communication and potential malware deployment to the use of wipers or ransomware for data destruction.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' or the use of ransomware but does indicate the group's capability to deploy additional malware and exfiltrate data, which could precede data destruction tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the capabilities and tactics of Agrius as described in the CTI report, focusing on their use of custom malware and communication with C2 servers.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the question's implication of a potential next step in the attack sequence involving data destruction.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of Agrius deploying wipers or ransomware based on their demonstrated capabilities and tactics.
   - **Step 4**: Consider that while the report does not explicitly mention wipers or ransomware, the group's ability to deploy custom malware and exfiltrate data suggests they have the capability to cause further harm, including data destruction, as part of their attack sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Agrius' demonstrated capabilities in deploying custom malware, communicating with C2 servers, and exfiltrating data, it is plausible they could deploy wipers like 'Apostle' or ransomware as a further step in their attack sequence to destroy data on targeted systems.

Final Answer: A
