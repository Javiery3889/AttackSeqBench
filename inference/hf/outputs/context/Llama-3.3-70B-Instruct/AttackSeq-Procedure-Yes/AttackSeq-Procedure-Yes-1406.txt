To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where attackers target Instagram users, especially influencers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics starts with **Initial Access**, where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages.
   - These messages are used to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface.
   - After gaining access, the attackers demand ransom for the return of the compromised accounts and use the stolen accounts for further scams.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after delivering phishing messages, it is likely that the attackers will use phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials before locking out the original owners.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves phishing, collecting credentials, and then locking out the original account owners.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions that the attackers use phishing messages to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites.
   - It is logical that after obtaining these credentials, the attackers would use them to access the accounts and then change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.
   - This action aligns with the reported behavior of the attackers demanding ransom for the return of compromised accounts, indicating they have control over these accounts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages.
   - **Step 2**: These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges to lure victims.
   - **Step 3**: Victims are tricked into providing their credentials on phishing sites.
   - **Step 4**: Attackers use the collected credentials to access the accounts.
   - **Step 5**: They change the account passwords, locking out the original owners.
   - Given the information in the CTI report and the logical sequence of events in a phishing campaign, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers would indeed use phishing sites to collect credentials before locking out the original owners.

Final Answer: A
