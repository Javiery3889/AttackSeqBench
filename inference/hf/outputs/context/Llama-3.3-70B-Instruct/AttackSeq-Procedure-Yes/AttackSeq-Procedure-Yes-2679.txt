To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report details a new Mirai variant, KiraV2, which exploits vulnerabilities in IoT devices for initial access.
   - It executes various DDoS attacks and distributes itself to vulnerable IoT devices.
   - KiraV2 uses encoded strings for C&C server communication and employs anti-analysis techniques.
   - The malware ensures standalone execution and maintains its presence on infected devices.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing anti-analysis techniques, KiraV2 is likely to communicate with a C&C server and receive commands for executing DDoS attacks.
   - The key elements here are the use of anti-analysis techniques and the communication with a C&C server for DDoS attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know KiraV2 uses anti-analysis techniques such as encoding strings and changing process names to evade detection.
   - The report also mentions that KiraV2 uses encoded strings for C&C server communication, which implies that after evading detection, it indeed communicates with a C&C server.
   - Furthermore, the primary impact of KiraV2 is through DDoS attacks, which it supports in various forms, indicating that receiving commands for such attacks is part of its operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify KiraV2's primary functions and behaviors as described in the CTI report, including its use of anti-analysis techniques and its role in executing DDoS attacks.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the use of anti-analysis techniques is a method to evade detection, not to prevent communication with a C&C server.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the communication with a C&C server is essential for receiving commands, including those for executing DDoS attacks, which aligns with KiraV2's primary impact as described.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given KiraV2's design and purpose, it is logical that after employing anti-analysis techniques to evade detection, it would communicate with a C&C server to receive commands for DDoS attacks.

Final Answer: A
