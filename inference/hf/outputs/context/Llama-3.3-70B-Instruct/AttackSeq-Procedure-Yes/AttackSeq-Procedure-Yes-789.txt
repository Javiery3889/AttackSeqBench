To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the APT group IndigoZebra.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing campaign with a malicious email containing a password-protected RAR archive.
     2. **Execution**: The archive's executable acts as a dropper, opening a document to reduce suspicion and then dropping and executing a backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: The backdoor establishes persistence via a registry key modification.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses obfuscation.
     5. **Command and Control**: The backdoor uses Dropbox for C&C communication, creating a unique folder named after the victim's MAC address.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing persistence, the threat actor is likely to access files on the Desktop as part of file and directory discovery before communicating with the C2 server using Dropbox.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves:
     1. Establishing persistence.
     2. File and directory discovery (accessing files on the Desktop).
     3. Communicating with the C2 server using Dropbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that upon execution, the dropper opens the first document on the victim's desktop to reduce suspicion. This indicates an early interest in the victim's files.
   - After establishing persistence, it's logical for the threat actor to engage in discovery activities to understand the victim's environment better, which could include accessing files on the Desktop as part of broader file and directory discovery.
   - The use of Dropbox for C&C, including creating a unique folder for the victim, suggests a structured approach to managing compromised hosts, which could be preceded by gathering information about the host, such as its MAC address and potentially the contents or layout of the Desktop.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The threat actor has already shown interest in the victim's desktop by opening a document to reduce suspicion early in the attack.
   - **Step 2**: Establishing persistence is a key step that allows the threat actor to maintain access over time, which would be followed by efforts to understand the victim's environment better.
   - **Step 3**: Accessing files on the Desktop can be part of this discovery process, providing valuable information about the victim.
   - **Step 4**: The creation of a unique folder in Dropbox named after the victim's MAC address for C&C communication suggests a methodical approach to victim management, which could logically follow initial discovery activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the threat actor's interest in the victim's environment and the logical sequence of establishing persistence followed by discovery activities before structured C2 communication, it is plausible that the threat actor would access files on the Desktop as part of file and directory discovery before communicating with the C2 server using Dropbox.
