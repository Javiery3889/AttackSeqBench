To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Outlaw hacking group using the Perl-based Shellbot.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Compromised an FTP server and a government site by exploiting a vulnerability on the Dovecot mail server.
     2. **Execution**: Distributed the Shellbot by exploiting command injection vulnerabilities or via brute-forced/compromised hosts.
     3. **Persistence**: The Shellbot communicates with C&C servers via IRC persistently.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Hides from system admins and security tools by assigning hardcoded process names and using PING/PONG communication.
     5. **Discovery**: Gathers information about the infected host.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gathering information about the infected host, the Shellbot is likely to establish C&C communication using an IRC channel.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the Shellbot's actions post-discovery, specifically focusing on its communication method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that after the Shellbot infects a host, it communicates persistently with the C&C servers via IRC (under **Persistence**).
   - The question specifically mentions the Shellbot gathering information about the infected host, which aligns with the **Discovery** phase.
   - Given that the Shellbot uses IRC for C&C communication as part of its **Persistence** mechanism, and considering the context provided, it is logical to infer that after gathering information (Discovery), the Shellbot would continue to use the established method of communication, which is via an IRC channel, for C&C purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that the Shellbot communicates with C&C servers via IRC as part of its persistence mechanism.
   - The question's context about gathering information aligns with the Discovery phase, which precedes the need for ongoing C&C communication.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after the Discovery phase, the Shellbot would indeed use an IRC channel for C&C communication, as this is its established method for persistence.
   - **Final Answer: A**
