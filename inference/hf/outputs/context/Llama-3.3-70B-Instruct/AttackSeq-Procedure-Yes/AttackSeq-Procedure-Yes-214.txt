To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack involving the Elirks malware, which is a backdoor Trojan used for stealing information.
   - Elirks retrieves its Command and Control (C2) server address by accessing a predetermined microblog service or Social Networking Site (SNS).
   - The attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers on these platforms.
   - Examples of this behavior include the use of a Japanese blog service in 2016 and a similar method in 2014, with the attacker's blog account still active.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites.
   - This involves attackers creating accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 address by accessing predetermined microblog services or SNS, where attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers.
   - This matches the scenario described in the question, indicating that the method of retrieving C2 server addresses via microblog services or SNS is a known tactic used by the attackers employing Elirks malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method Elirks malware uses to retrieve its C2 server address, as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Compare this method with the scenario presented in the question.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the information in the CTI report supports the scenario described in the question.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the CTI report explicitly states Elirks malware retrieves its C2 address by accessing microblog services or SNS where attackers post encoded C2 server information, it directly supports the scenario described in the question.

Final Answer: A
