To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the OceanLotus backdoor's attack sequence:
     1. **Initial Access**: Delivered via a zip file, presumably through an email attachment, containing a disguised application bundle.
     2. **Execution**: The backdoor executes, displaying a decoy document, and opens a hidden file.
     3. **Persistence**: Creates a Launch Agent for startup, copies itself to a new location based on the user's UID, and deletes the original application bundle.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs string encoding, avoids suspicious utilities, and uses a custom binary protocol with encryption for C2 communication.
     5. **Command and Control**: Communicates with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, involving session initiation, command reception, execution, and encrypted result sending.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the backdoor's ability to communicate with its C2 server using a custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - It mentions the communication sequence involves receiving a command from the server, executing it, and sending back the results encrypted.
   - Given that the backdoor has established persistence and has a mechanism for encrypted communication with its C2 server, it is plausible that one of the commands it could receive and execute involves surveying the system and sending back system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The OceanLotus backdoor achieves persistence through creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to a specific location.
   - **Step 2**: The backdoor has a sophisticated communication mechanism with its C2 server, involving the reception of commands and the sending of encrypted results.
   - **Step 3**: Given the backdoor's design for stealth, persistence, and communication capabilities, it is reasonable to infer that surveying the victim's computer and sending system information could be within its capabilities and aligns with typical APT behaviors.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the backdoor's functionality and communication capabilities described in the CTI report, it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor would survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server as part of its operation.

Final Answer: A
