To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the StellarParticle campaign's tactics, which include:
     1. **Initial Access**: Gaining access via SSH, RDP, and VPNs, and exporting saved passwords from Chrome.
     2. **Persistence**: Using credential hopping, accounts with Delegated Administrator rights, and configuring malware (TrailBlazer and GoldMax) for persistence.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA, using renamed utilities, and renaming systems to blend in.
     4. **Discovery**: Using tools like AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools to gather information from Active Directory.
     5. **Lateral Movement**: Using RDP with both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
     6. **Collection**: Accessing data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence (through credential hopping and configuring malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence), it's likely that the StellarParticle campaign would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations to use in credential access techniques for accessing cloud resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that the StellarParticle campaign has already demonstrated the ability and intent to steal credentials and bypass security measures (e.g., MFA) by stealing browser cookies.
   - The campaign's use of credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence suggests a sophisticated approach to maintaining access within the victim's network.
   - The specific mention of stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA in the Defense Evasion section implies that the threat actors are interested in leveraging such tactics for credential access.
   - Accessing cloud resources would be a logical next step after establishing persistence and lateral movement within the network, especially considering the mention of adding credentials to O365 Service Principals and creating new ones.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The StellarParticle campaign has demonstrated sophisticated tactics for initial access, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, and collection.
   - **Step 2**: The campaign's use of credential hopping and malware configuration for persistence indicates a strong intent to maintain access within the victim's network.
   - **Step 3**: The specific tactic of stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA shows the campaign's interest in leveraging web session cookies for credential access.
   - **Step 4**: Given the campaign's goals and demonstrated tactics, it is reasonable to conclude that stealing web session cookies to access cloud resources aligns with their modus operandi.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the tactics and techniques described in the CTI report, it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations to use in credential access techniques for accessing cloud resources.

Final Answer: A
