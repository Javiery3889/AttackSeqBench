To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the OceanLotus group (APT32) using a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown'.
   - **Initial Access**: KerrDown is delivered via Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros or RAR archives with DLL side-loading.
   - **Execution**: The malicious document contains an image asking the victim to enable macros. It has two base64 blobs for 32-bit and 64-bit systems, which are decoded and executed based on the victim's system architecture.
   - **Command and Control**: The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, downloaded from a URL depending on the OS architecture.
   - **Others**: Provides context about the threat actor's operations and the protection measures.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after decoding and executing the base64 blob, the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is known for its ability to execute in memory and use process injection for defense evasion.
   - Cobalt Strike Beacon is a commercial penetration testing tool that threat actors use for its capabilities, including executing payloads in memory and using process injection to evade detection.
   - Given that KerrDown's final payload is a variant of this tool, it is reasonable to infer that it would utilize similar tactics for defense evasion, such as process injection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the final payload of KerrDown as a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize Cobalt Strike Beacon's capabilities, including in-memory execution and process injection for defense evasion.
   - **Step 3**: Infer that KerrDown, delivering such a payload, is likely designed to utilize similar evasion techniques.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the nature of the payload and the typical behaviors of such malware, it is plausible that the KerrDown DLL would execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic.

Final Answer: A
