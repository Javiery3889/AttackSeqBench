To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details SideCopy APT's activities targeting government personnel in India.
   - Tactics include using decoys, honeytraps, and cloning legitimate websites to serve malicious content.
   - SideCopy has a particular interest in Kavach, an MFA app used across India's government.
   - They deploy njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - The group's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials from central Indian government employees.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT before exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases using GoLang-based file recon plugins during Exfiltration.
   - The question essentially inquires about the plausibility of a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by SideCopy.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we understand that SideCopy's primary goal is credential harvesting, with a focus on Kavach.
   - The use of njRAT malware specifically targeted at Kavach ('kavach' victim IDs) indicates a deliberate effort to compromise this MFA app.
   - The subsequent use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases aligns with the goal of credential harvesting.
   - The sequence of using njRAT for initial credential access and then using specialized plugins for exfiltration fits the described TTPs of SideCopy, aiming to gather and extract sensitive information from targeted systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify SideCopy's primary objective, which is credential harvesting from Indian government employees, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the use of njRAT with 'kavach' victim IDs as a method for initial credential access.
   - **Step 3**: Understand the role of GoLang-based file recon plugins in exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases as a follow-up action to credential access.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the sequence of using njRAT for credential access followed by the use of GoLang-based plugins for exfiltration is consistent with SideCopy's TTPs and objectives.
   
**Final Answer: A**
