To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: Tropic Trooper exploits vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) to download and install an MSI package. This step involves the execution of malicious documents that exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the installation of the malware.

2. **Persistence**: After the initial access, the backdoor loads an encrypted configuration file, decrypts it, and then uses the SSL protocol to connect to the command-and-control (C&C) servers. This step implies that the backdoor has already been installed and is now establishing a persistent connection with the C&C servers.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The use of DLL hijacking and other evasion techniques suggests that the malware is attempting to avoid detection after it has been installed. This step is part of the post-exploitation phase, where the malware is trying to maintain its presence on the system without being detected.

Given this sequence of events, the question asks whether malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the C&C servers via SSL.

- **Execution of Malicious Documents**: This is the initial step where the exploit is delivered, typically through phishing emails with malicious Office documents. This step leads to the download and installation of the MSI package, which contains the backdoor.

- **Establishing Persistence**: After the backdoor is installed, it then proceeds to decrypt its configuration file and connect to the C&C servers via SSL to establish persistence and receive further commands.

Based on the sequence of events described:
- The execution of malicious documents is what leads to the initial installation of the backdoor (part of the initial access tactic).
- The backdoor then establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration and connecting to the C&C servers.

Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the execution of malicious documents (which host the backdoor's dropper) indeed occurs before the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the C&C servers via SSL.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Exploitation of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities leading to the download and installation of an MSI package.
2. Understand the role of malicious documents: They are the vectors for the initial exploit, leading to the installation of the backdoor.
3. Determine the sequence of events: The backdoor's installation is followed by its establishment of persistence through decryption of its configuration and connection to C&C servers.
4. Conclude the relationship between the execution of malicious documents and the establishment of persistence: The execution of malicious documents precedes the establishment of persistence.

**Final Answer**: A
