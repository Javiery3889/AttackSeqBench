To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Carbanak group, detailing their tactics from reconnaissance to exfiltration.
   - Key steps include:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting data on banking applications and internal procedures.
     2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing with malicious URLs and documents to download a Cobalt Strike beacon.
     3. **Execution**: Downloading and executing new payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files.
     4. **Persistence**: Establishing a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Compromising a Domain Administrator account.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Minimizing detection by operating outside business hours and limiting system interactions.
     7. **Credential Access**: Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and additional endpoints.
     8. **Discovery**: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network.
     9. **Collection**: Collecting documents for exfiltration.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon for communication with compromised systems.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Preparing documents for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after discovering and mapping the organization's internal network and collecting administrative-level credentials, it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure.
   - The question focuses on the actions following the discovery and credential collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the discovery phase (using the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network) and collecting administrative-level credentials, the attackers aimed to compromise a Domain Administrator account and used it to move across the infrastructure.
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of compromised credentials to compromise at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day, indicating lateral movement.
   - The attackers' goal of collecting administrative-level credentials and their actions post-discovery suggest a strategy of lateral movement to access and compromise additional systems within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have already demonstrated the capability and intent to move laterally by compromising additional endpoints using the Domain Administrator account.
   - **Step 2**: The collection of administrative-level credentials is a key step in facilitating lateral movement, as it allows access to more systems and resources within the network.
   - **Step 3**: The use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for command and control enables the attackers to issue commands to compromised systems, which can include instructions to move laterally and compromise additional hosts and servers.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the attackers' actions and goals as described in the CTI report, it is highly likely that they will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Final Answer: A
