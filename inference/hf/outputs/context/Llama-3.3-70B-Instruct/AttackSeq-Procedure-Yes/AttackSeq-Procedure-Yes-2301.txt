To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the adversary.

1. **Initial Access**: The adversary gains access to the victim's network by using compromised credentials to access remote services like VPN or Citrix. This is the initial point of entry.

2. **Persistence**: The report mentions that the adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system. It specifically states that once the system is rebooted, the beacon is gone. However, the adversary achieves persistence by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.

3. **Analysis of the Question**: The question asks if, after obtaining access to the victim's network, it is likely that the adversary will rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory before achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

Given the information in the CTI report:
- The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms.
- The report does not mention the use of scheduled tasks as a method for executing the Cobalt Strike beacon.
- Persistence is achieved by targeting systems with high uptimes, such as servers, not through scheduled tasks.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The adversary's method of loading the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory does not involve scheduled tasks according to the report.
2. The report explicitly states that the beacon is loaded in memory without persistence mechanisms and is lost upon reboot, indicating a lack of automated execution methods like scheduled tasks for this purpose.
3. The persistence mechanism mentioned involves targeting systems with high uptimes, which does not imply the use of scheduled tasks for executing the beacon.

**Final Answer**: B
