To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by Turla using LightNeuron, a backdoor targeting Microsoft Exchange mail servers.
   - The sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access (T1078, Valid Accounts)**: Stolen credentials used to deploy LightNeuron.
     2. **Execution (T1086, PowerShell)**: PowerShell script used to install LightNeuron.
     3. **Privilege Escalation (T1078, Valid Accounts)**: Stolen credentials likely used to obtain administrative rights.
     4. **Discovery (T1016, System Network Configuration Discovery)**: LightNeuron executes functions to discover system network configurations.
     5. **Command and Control**: Uses emails for C&C communication, encrypted with AES, and hides data in PDFs or JPGs using steganography.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Conducts data exfiltration through the email C&C channel, with data encrypted using AES.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after discovering system network configurations, LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves discovery and potential subsequent actions of data collection and exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the discovery phase (where system network configurations are discovered), the next steps involve establishing Command and Control and potentially exfiltrating data.
   - The report specifically mentions that data exfiltration is conducted through the email C&C channel, which implies that the malware is capable of collecting and sending data, including potentially emails and local files, back to the attackers.
   - The use of encryption (AES) and steganography for hiding C&C data in PDFs or JPG images suggests a sophisticated approach to data handling and exfiltration, supporting the idea that LightNeuron could collect and exfiltrate sensitive data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities of LightNeuron post-discovery, which include establishing a sophisticated C&C channel and the ability to exfiltrate data.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the exfiltration method (through the email C&C channel) implies the ability to collect and send data.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the attack, which targets Microsoft Exchange servers, a rich source of sensitive information including emails.
   - **Conclusion**: Given LightNeuron's capabilities and the context of the attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after discovering system network configurations, LightNeuron would likely collect emails and local files for eventual exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
