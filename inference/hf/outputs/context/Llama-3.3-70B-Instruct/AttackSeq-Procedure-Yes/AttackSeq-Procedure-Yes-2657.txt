To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Execution involves a custom loader exploiting a side-loading vulnerability to load the Korplug variant.
   - Persistence is established through creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - Defense evasion techniques include control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption.
   - The Korplug variant collects system information and data from local and network locations.
   - Exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting data, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - The specifics of the communication protocol mentioned include an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, followed by encrypted communication over TCP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.
   - This detail directly supports the notion that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for communication, specifically for exfiltrating data.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the initial handshake protocol (HTTPS or TCP), it does emphasize the use of encryption and custom protocols for communication, which aligns with the practices described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of data exfiltration used by Korplug, which is via a custom protocol.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that this protocol involves TCP messages, indicating TCP is used for communication.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the question's specifics about the initial handshake and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP are consistent with the report's description of using custom, encrypted protocols for communication.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the report's details on exfiltration and communication protocols support the likelihood of Korplug communicating with C&C servers in the manner described in the question.

Final Answer: A
