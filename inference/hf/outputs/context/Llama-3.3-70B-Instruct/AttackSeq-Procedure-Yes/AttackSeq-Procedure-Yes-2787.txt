To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Operation Pawn Storm involving iOS malware, part of the SEDNIT malware family.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The XAgent app is installed, hides its icon (on iOS 7), runs in the background, and can restart itself if terminated (on iOS 7).
   - **Discovery**: The app collects various information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, etc.) and performs several routines on the device.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting information, the app is likely to send the gathered data via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves data collection, followed by potential exfiltration via HTTP, and then uploading files via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the malware's ability to collect extensive information from the device but does not explicitly mention how this information is exfiltrated.
   - However, the question of whether the malware would use HTTP for sending gathered information and then FTP for uploading files as part of C2 operations requires an understanding of common C2 communication methods used by malware.
   - Malware often uses HTTP for C2 communications due to its commonality and ability to blend in with normal network traffic. Using FTP for uploading files could be plausible for transferring larger or specific files back to the command and control server.
   - Given the malware's sophistication (as indicated by its ability to collect a wide range of data and operate stealthily), it's reasonable to consider that it could use standard internet protocols for data exfiltration and communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the malware's capabilities as described - data collection and stealthy operation.
   - **Step 2**: Consider common malware C2 communication methods - HTTP is frequently used for its ubiquity and ability to evade detection.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the plausibility of using FTP for file uploads - while less common than HTTP for C2, it's conceivable for specific file transfers.
   - **Step 4**: Given the sophistication of the malware and common practices in malware communications, it's reasonable to assume the malware could use HTTP for initial data transfer and potentially FTP for specific file uploads as part of its C2 operations.

Final Answer: A
