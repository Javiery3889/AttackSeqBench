To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Grandoreiro, a Latin American banking trojan.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails, exploiting COVID-19 fears or using fake Java/Flash updates.
     2. **Persistence**: Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to maintain its foothold.
     3. **Privilege Escalation**: Employs various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including API hooking and registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files.
     4. **Credential Access**: Steals credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
     5. **Discovery**: Collects information about the victim's computer, including the computer name, username, operating system version, and installed security products.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after employing tricks to evade detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves evasive maneuvers (like API hooking and detection of virtual environments) followed by the collection of information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that Grandoreiro collects information about its victims as part of its **Discovery** tactic. This includes details such as the computer name, username, operating system version, and whether specific banking protection software is installed.
   - The question implies that after Grandoreiro has established itself and potentially evaded detection (through methods like API hooking), it would proceed to collect information about the victim's computer.
   - Given the malware's capabilities and objectives (such as stealing banking information and maintaining persistence), it is logical that it would collect such information to tailor its actions, decide on the best approach for credential theft, and report back to its C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of Grandoreiro, which is to steal banking information and maintain access to the victim's system.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that collecting information about the victim's system is a crucial step in achieving these goals, as it helps in evading security measures and targeting the right information.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the CTI report explicitly mentions the collection of system information as part of Grandoreiro's tactics.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given Grandoreiro's design and objectives, it is highly likely that it would collect information about the victim's computer after employing evasive maneuvers.

Final Answer: A
