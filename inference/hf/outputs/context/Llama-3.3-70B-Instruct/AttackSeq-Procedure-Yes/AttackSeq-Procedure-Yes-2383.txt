To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report states that the initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - The malware, TDrop2, executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code, allowing it to evade detection.
   - After execution, the malware performed discovery activities, including collecting system information, network views, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access, it's likely that TDrop2 would use process hollowing for execution to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities like gathering system information and network views.
   - The answer choices are "Yes" or "No".

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that after initial access, TDrop2 executed using process hollowing to evade detection.
   - It then mentions that the malware performed discovery activities, which includes gathering system information and network views.
   - This sequence of events (initial access -> execution with process hollowing -> discovery activities) matches the scenario described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - The report clearly states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails with trojanized executables.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the execution method - The report specifies that TDrop2 used process hollowing to execute its malicious code, evading detection.
   - **Step 3**: Identify post-execution activities - The malware then engaged in discovery activities, which aligns with the question's description of gathering system information and network views.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of events described in the CTI report (initial access via spear-phishing, execution with process hollowing, and then discovery activities), the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) is that after initial access, TDrop2 would indeed perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.

Final Answer: A
