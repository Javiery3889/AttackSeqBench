To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing, which executed a custom backdoor called Pterodo.
   - **Execution:** After initial compromise, Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain presence and execute their backdoor. They also created scheduled tasks for persistence.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks were created to execute malicious VBS files every few minutes, ensuring the backdoor remained active.
   - **Collection:** Deployment of custom VBS backdoor variants and execution of VBS scripts.
   - **Command and Control:** Shuckworm used HTTP requests to communicate with their servers and download additional payloads.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after executing malicious VBS scripts and deploying their custom backdoor, Shuckworm is likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The report mentions the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files for maintaining presence and executing the backdoor. 
   - mshta.exe is associated with executing HTA (HTML Application) files. Given that Shuckworm used HTA files as part of their tactics, it's plausible they could use mshta.exe to execute these files, potentially bypassing application control solutions that might not monitor or restrict mshta.exe as closely as other executables.
   - The use of HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading is directly mentioned in the report, indicating this is a known behavior of Shuckworm.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify Shuckworm's known tactics, which include executing VBS scripts and HTA files.
   - **Step 2:** Recognize the role of mshta.exe in executing HTA files and its potential for bypassing application control solutions.
   - **Step 3:** Acknowledge Shuckworm's use of HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.
   - **Step 4:** Given the information, assess the likelihood of Shuckworm using mshta.exe as part of their tactics to bypass controls before establishing C&C communications.

**Final Answer:** A
