To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CostaRicto Campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Stolen credentials were used to gain access, with SSH tools setting up remote tunneling.
     2. **Execution**: Malicious code was executed through various methods, including the use of a PowerShell loader and a custom VM-based payload loader.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques like process injection and deobfuscation were used.
     4. **Discovery**: The SombRAT backdoor was used for process, system information, and system time discovery, along with network service scanning.
     5. **Collection**: Collected data was archived using a custom storage file format.
     6. **Command and Control (C2)**: The SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing C2 communication, the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel, given the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the attackers have established a secure communication channel with their C2 servers, utilizing protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with additional security measures such as SSL encryption and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
   - The use of such secure communication methods typically suggests an intention to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data being communicated, which would include exfiltrated data.
   - The report also mentions that the SombRAT backdoor archives collected data, implying an intent to exfiltrate this data at some point.
   - Given the secure nature of the C2 communication channel and the capabilities of the SombRAT backdoor, it is reasonable to conclude that the backdoor would use this secure channel for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the secure communication methods used by the CostaRicto Campaign for C2 communication.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the implications of using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for data protection.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities of the SombRAT backdoor, including data collection and archiving.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the use of a secure C2 channel, combined with the backdoor's data collection capabilities, suggests a likely intent to exfiltrate data over this channel.
   
Final Answer: A
