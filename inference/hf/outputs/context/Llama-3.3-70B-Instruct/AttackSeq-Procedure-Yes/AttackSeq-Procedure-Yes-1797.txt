To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through the exploitation of an Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) embedded in a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).
   - The attackers then used **Defense Evasion** techniques, specifically mentioning the use of a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
   - The report also mentions **Command and Control** activities, where the malware connected back to specific domains controlled by the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the attackers using a specific dropper executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable, after the initial access via the Adobe Flash Player exploit.
   - The question focuses on the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) related to defense evasion and the potential use of a specific executable for sideloading.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report confirms the exploitation of the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability for initial access and the use of sideloading for defense evasion.
   - However, the report does not specifically mention the use of "Rdws.exe" as the dropper executable for DLL sideloading. It only mentions that a malicious DLL was deployed alongside a legitimate program executable.
   - Given the information provided, the question introduces a specific detail (Rdws.exe) not present in the CTI report. The report supports the general technique of sideloading a malicious DLL but does not specify the executable used for this purpose.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details the exploitation of a vulnerability for initial access and the use of sideloading for defense evasion.
   - The question asks about a specific executable (Rdws.exe) used in the sideloading process, which is not mentioned in the report.
   - Since the report does not provide information about the specific dropper executable used (Rdws.exe), and given that the general technique of sideloading is mentioned, we must evaluate the likelihood based on the information provided.
   - The report does support the use of sideloading as a technique but lacks specifics about the executable. Therefore, without explicit mention of Rdws.exe in the report, we cannot confirm its use based solely on the information provided.

Final Answer: B
