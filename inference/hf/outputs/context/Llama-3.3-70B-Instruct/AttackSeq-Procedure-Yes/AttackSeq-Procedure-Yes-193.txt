To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FamousSparrow.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow acquired infrastructure such as domains and servers from various providers. This is a preparatory phase where the group develops and acquires resources needed for the attack.
   - **Execution and Initial Access:** The group exploited known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera for initial access. This step is about gaining entry into the target system.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will acquire domains and servers (Resource Development) before gaining Initial Access by exploiting public-facing applications.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that FamousSparrow engaged in Resource Development to acquire infrastructure, which would logically precede the need for this infrastructure in later stages of the attack, such as Initial Access.
   - The acquisition of domains and servers is a necessary step before these can be used in the attack, such as hosting malicious payloads or serving as command and control (C2) servers.
   - The exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera is described as a method for initial access, which would follow the preparation of resources such as domains and servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the purpose of Resource Development in the context of the attack. It involves acquiring necessary resources (domains, servers) for the attack.
   - **Step 2:** Recognize that Initial Access, achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities, requires the attacker to have resources in place to support the attack, such as hosting malware or providing C2 channels.
   - **Step 3:** Conclude that logically, acquiring infrastructure (Resource Development) must happen before or at least in preparation for the exploitation of vulnerabilities (Initial Access), as the attacker needs these resources to facilitate the attack.

**Final Answer: A**
