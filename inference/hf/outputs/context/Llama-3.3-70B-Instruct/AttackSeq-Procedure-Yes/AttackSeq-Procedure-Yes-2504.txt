To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by two Chinese APT groups, APT3 and APT18.
   - APT3's attack sequence involves:
     1. Phishing emails with URLs resolving to a specific IP address.
     2. Redirecting to JavaScript profilers and a malicious Adobe Flash file.
     3. Downloading an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload (a DLL backdoor).
     4. The SHOTPUT payload communicates over HTTP to hardcoded command and control (CnC) addresses.
   - APT18's attack sequence involves:
     1. Phishing emails prompting victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update.
     2. Exploitation delivers a GH0ST RAT variant.
     3. The GH0ST RAT calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor, it is likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT (delivered by APT18) calls out to an APT18 CnC address.
   - The question essentially asks about the communication behavior of the SHOTPUT backdoor and GH0ST RAT after they are delivered.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that the SHOTPUT backdoor, once delivered, communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses.
   - We also know that the GH0ST RAT variant delivered by APT18's campaign calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.
   - The question's scenario aligns with the behaviors described in the CTI report for both APT3's SHOTPUT backdoor and APT18's GH0ST RAT.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the behavior of the SHOTPUT backdoor after delivery. According to the report, it communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses.
   - **Step 2**: Identify the behavior of the GH0ST RAT delivered by APT18. The report states it calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the behaviors described in the question match the report. Yes, they do. The SHOTPUT backdoor is expected to communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, and the GH0ST RAT is expected to call out to an APT18 CnC address.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while the GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address, as these behaviors are directly stated in the report.

Final Answer: A
