To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence of the NanHaiShu malware, which includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
     2. **Execution**: The malicious macro in the attachment executes, decoding and running JScript, and establishing persistence.
     3. **Persistence**: The malware modifies the registry to ensure autostart.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: It uses encoding and obfuscation to evade detection.
     5. **Discovery**: The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
     6. **Exfiltration**: It can receive and execute additional scripts for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gathering system information, NanHaiShu is likely to communicate with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves:
     1. Gathering system information (Discovery).
     2. Communicating with C&C servers.
     3. Downloading and executing additional scripts (Exfiltration).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after gathering system information (Discovery), the malware is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code, which can be used for exfiltration.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP POST and HTTP GET for communication with C&C servers. However, it does imply communication for uploading system information and potentially for receiving additional scripts.
   - Given the context, it's reasonable to infer that communication with C&C servers could involve common web protocols like HTTP POST and GET for exchanging information and receiving commands or scripts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the sequence of TTPs in the CTI report and the question.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the malware gathers system information and then can communicate with C&C servers for further instructions or data exchange.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of using HTTP POST and GET for such communication, given their common use in web-based interactions.
   - **Conclusion**: While the report does not explicitly detail the communication protocols used, the described capabilities of the malware and common practices in malware C&C communication support the likelihood of using HTTP POST and GET for interacting with C&C servers before downloading and executing additional scripts.

Final Answer: A
