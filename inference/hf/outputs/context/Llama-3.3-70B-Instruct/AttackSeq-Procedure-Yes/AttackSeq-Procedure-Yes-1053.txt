To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Darkhotel APT's tactics in detail, starting from reconnaissance, where they target specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks.
   - They develop resources to compromise trusted commercial network resources globally, showing advanced capabilities in mathematics and crypto-analysis.
   - Initial access is gained through malware disguised as software updates or seeded in P2P sharing sites.
   - Execution involves deploying various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, along with 0-day exploits.
   - Defense evasion techniques include using digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypting gathered data.
   - Credential access and collection involve targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services, and encrypting gathered data.
   - Command and control is maintained through a web interface, with data encryption on servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after deploying malware, the Darkhotel APT is likely to maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware.
   - The question focuses on the tactic of "Persistence" as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems or maintain a presence within a network over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of autorun registry settings for persistence. However, it does detail the deployment of various malware components and the use of advanced techniques for defense evasion and credential access.
   - Given the sophistication and the range of tactics employed by the Darkhotel APT, including the use of digital certificates to sign backdoors and the employment of encryption for gathered data, it is plausible that they would also use persistence techniques to maintain access to compromised systems.
   - The use of autorun registry settings is a common method for maintaining persistence, allowing malware to execute automatically when a system starts up or a user logs in.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the tactics and techniques used by the Darkhotel APT as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the question's focus on persistence as a tactic.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of the Darkhotel APT using autorun registry settings and malware for persistence based on their demonstrated capabilities and the commonality of this technique in malware operations.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the Darkhotel APT's sophisticated nature and the common use of autorun registry settings for persistence in malware campaigns, it is reasonable to conclude that they would likely use such methods to maintain access to compromised systems.

Final Answer: A
