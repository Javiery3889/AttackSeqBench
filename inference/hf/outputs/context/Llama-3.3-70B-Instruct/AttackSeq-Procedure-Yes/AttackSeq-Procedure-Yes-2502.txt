To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign named RevengeHotels targeting the hospitality sector.
   - **Initial Access**: The attackers use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments (exploiting CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution**: The attachments execute macro code, which downloads and executes malware like RevengeRAT.
   - **Credential Access**: The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTAs).
   - **Others**: Provides context about the campaign's history, its detection by Kaspersky, and the availability of IoCs.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access and executing RAT malware, it's likely that attackers will collect credit card information from Online Travel Agency (OTA) websites.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves initial access through spear-phishing, execution of malware, and the potential collection of credit card information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions that one of the modules, ScreenBooking, captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com, which is an OTA website.
   - This indicates that the attackers have a specific interest in collecting credit card data from OTAs, aligning with the question's scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - The attackers use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the execution method of malware - The attachments execute macro code to download and execute RAT malware like RevengeRAT.
   - **Step 3**: Assess the goal of collecting credit card information - The report states that the attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and OTAs.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of collecting credit card information from OTA websites - Given the specific mention of a module targeting booking.com and the overall goal of capturing credit card data, it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations.
   
Final Answer: A
