To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - These emails are designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The sequence of attack as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
     - **Execution**: Opening the Word document executes a VBS macro, which calls a PowerShell script.
     - **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
     - **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers to download payloads.
     - **Impact**: Execution of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     - Initial access through phishing emails.
     - Execution of VBS macros from the Word document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that the campaign involves phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - Upon opening these documents, a VBS macro executes, leading to further malicious activities.
   - The question essentially asks if this sequence of events (phishing email leading to the execution of VBS macros) is likely, given the context of the campaign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The campaign uses phishing emails as an initial access vector, which matches the first part of the question.
   - **Step 2**: These emails contain Word documents with embedded macros, which, when opened, execute a VBS macro.
   - **Step 3**: The execution of the VBS macro is a critical step in the attack sequence as it leads to the download and execution of malware payloads.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
