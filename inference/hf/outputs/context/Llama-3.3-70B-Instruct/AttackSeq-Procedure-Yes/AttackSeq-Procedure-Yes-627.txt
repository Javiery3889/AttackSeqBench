To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an APT campaign where the initial access is gained through a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - Upon execution, the HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file while executing a backdoor in the background.
   - The malware uses VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing evasion techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
   - The malware also uses obfuscation and checks for file existence before deletion to ensure persistence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after delivering the malware and executing the VB Script to drop and open a decoy file, it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.
   - Specifically, it mentions rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the malware employs techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection, including obfuscation and evasion methods.
   - The use of a decoy document and background execution of a backdoor suggests the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent.
   - Rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename could be a method to evade detection, as it would make it harder for security software to identify the malware based on its filename or path.
   - Creating a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file from a temporary location aligns with the tactics of evasion and persistence mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's initial action involves executing a VB Script to drop and open a decoy file, indicating a focus on stealth and evasion.
   - **Step 2**: The report highlights the malware's use of evasion techniques, including minimizing visibility and avoiding detection, which supports the idea of it using temporary, randomized filenames.
   - **Step 3**: The tactic of rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension, and then executing from there, fits the pattern of behavior described in the CTI report, aimed at evading detection and ensuring persistence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the malware's sophisticated evasion techniques and the goal of persistence, it is plausible that the malware would create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.

Final Answer: A
