To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Black Energy 2, a malware detected as Backdoor.Win32.Blakken.
   - **Execution**: Black Energy 2 executes malicious activities, hides its code, infects system processes, and allocates virtual memory for its operations.
   - **Persistence**: It maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe process.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The malware evades detection through encryption, code compression, and potentially anti-emulation techniques.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with its C&C center via HTTP requests, receiving an encrypted XML configuration file that can include commands for downloading and executing files, updating, or setting contact frequency.
   - **Others**: Black Energy 2 has evolved with plugins for capabilities beyond DDoS attacks, including spam distribution, credential grabbing, and proxy server setup.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after receiving an encrypted XML configuration file from its C&C server, Black Energy 2 is likely to initiate network denial-of-service attacks using DDoS plugins.
   - The question focuses on the behavior of Black Energy 2 post-communication with its C&C server, specifically regarding the initiation of DDoS attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that Black Energy 2 can receive general commands from the C&C, including downloading and executing files.
   - It also mentions that the malware has evolved to include plugins that extend its capabilities, with historical use for DDoS attacks and the potential for other malicious activities.
   - Given that the malware can receive commands and has the capability for DDoS attacks through plugins, it is plausible that upon receiving specific commands (potentially included in the encrypted XML configuration file), Black Energy 2 could initiate DDoS attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities of Black Energy 2 as described in the CTI report, including its ability to communicate with a C&C server and receive commands.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the historical and potential use of Black Energy 2 for DDoS attacks, as well as its ability to extend its capabilities through plugins.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the question, which involves the receipt of an encrypted XML configuration file that could contain commands for the malware.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, it is reasonable to conclude that Black Energy 2 could indeed initiate DDoS attacks after receiving appropriate commands from its C&C server.

Final Answer: A
