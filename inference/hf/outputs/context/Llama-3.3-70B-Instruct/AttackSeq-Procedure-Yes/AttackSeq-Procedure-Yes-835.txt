To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Execution**: WinDealer malware executes, reads its configuration, and loads a DLL module. It steals information, including from SNS applications, and saves this data in the %TEMP% directory.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses encoding and encryption (XOR, AES, RSA) for its configuration and communication.
   - **Discovery**: It discovers and processes information about the infected PC, network, and SNS applications, encrypting the data with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Collection**: Collects data from various sources, including SNS applications, and processes it into ".a" files.
   - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates the stolen, encrypted data to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that WinDealer will steal information from SNS applications, encrypt this data using AES, and then communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report confirms that WinDealer steals information from SNS applications and encrypts the data using AES.
   - The report mentions that the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted channels but does not specify the ports used. However, the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication is a common tactic among malware to evade detection.
   - The question's details about stealing SNS application data and encrypting it with AES align with the report's information.
   - The specific ports mentioned (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) are not detailed in the report, but the report does indicate encrypted communication with C2 servers, which could plausibly involve non-standard ports.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key actions of the WinDealer malware from the CTI report, which include stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting the data.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the malware communicates with C2 servers using encryption, which supports the plausibility of using non-standard ports for such communication.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report does not explicitly mention the use of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 but does describe behaviors that align with the question's other details, we must consider the typical behaviors of malware and the goals of using non-standard ports.
   - **Step 4**: Given the malware's use of encryption for C2 communication and its evasion tactics, it is reasonable to infer that using non-standard ports could be part of its strategy to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A**
