To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the AtomBombing technique, which allows threat actors to inject malicious code into trusted processes.
   - This technique enables attackers to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products.
   - It's highlighted that AtomBombing does not require exploiting operating system bugs or vulnerabilities and cannot be fixed with a patch.
   - The report mentions that security products must monitor API calls for malicious activity to mitigate this technique.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using AtomBombing for malicious code injection via legitimate programs, it's likely that threat actors will bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.
   - The question focuses on the effectiveness of AtomBombing in evading various security solutions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we understand that AtomBombing is specifically designed to evade security products by injecting malicious code into trusted processes.
   - The technique's ability to bypass process-level restrictions implies it can potentially evade traditional security measures that rely on identifying malicious processes or code execution outside of trusted contexts.
   - Given that AtomBombing leverages Windows operating system mechanisms for code injection and does not rely on exploiting vulnerabilities, it suggests a high likelihood of evading detection by security solutions that are not monitoring API calls for such malicious activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The AtomBombing technique is designed for defense evasion by injecting malicious code into trusted processes, which suggests it can bypass traditional security checks.
   - **Step 2**: The technique does not require vulnerabilities to work, making it potentially more effective against security solutions that primarily focus on vulnerability exploitation.
   - **Step 3**: The report indicates that monitoring API calls is necessary to mitigate AtomBombing, implying that standard antivirus and endpoint protection solutions might not be effective unless they include such monitoring.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the nature of AtomBombing and its designed purpose to evade security products by leveraging legitimate processes and not relying on vulnerabilities, it is reasonable to conclude that threat actors using this technique are likely to bypass traditional antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions that do not specifically monitor for such activity.

Final Answer: A
