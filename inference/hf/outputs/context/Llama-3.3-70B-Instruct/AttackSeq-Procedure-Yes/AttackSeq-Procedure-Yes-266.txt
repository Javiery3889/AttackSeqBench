To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers initially deploy RATs by tricking users into opening email attachments or downloading files. This step involves file-based vectors.

2. **Execution**: The attackers execute RATs entirely in memory, avoiding disk interaction in a decrypted state. This technique is used to evade traditional antivirus and next-generation technologies focused on file-based threats.

3. **Persistence**: For persistence, the attackers create a registry key at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Load` pointing to the `PerfWatson.exe` binary. This step is crucial for maintaining access to the compromised system.

Given the sequence of events:
- The attackers first gain initial access through file-based vectors.
- They then execute the RAT in memory to evade detection.
- The question asks if it's likely that attackers will inject the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process before creating a persistence registry key.

From the report, we understand that the execution of the RAT in memory is a sophisticated technique to avoid detection. The creation of a registry key for persistence is a subsequent step to ensure the malware remains on the system. The injection of the NanoCore RAT into a new process is part of the execution phase, where the attackers execute the RAT entirely in memory. This implies that the injection of the RAT into a new process happens as part of executing the malware in memory, which precedes the creation of the persistence mechanism.

Therefore, considering the sequence of events:
- Initial access is gained.
- The RAT is executed in memory (which includes injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process as part of this execution).
- Persistence is established through the creation of a registry key.

Given this analysis, it is logical to conclude that the injection of the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process would indeed occur before the creation of the persistence registry key, as it is part of the execution phase that precedes persistence.
