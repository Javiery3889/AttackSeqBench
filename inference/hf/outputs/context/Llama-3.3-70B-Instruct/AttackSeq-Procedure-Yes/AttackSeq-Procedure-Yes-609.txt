To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Adversaries use worms and scanning tools like masscan to detect vulnerable hosts, including those with exposed Docker API ports.
2. **Initial Access**: Attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports to gain initial access. They also use tactics like typo-squatting to trick developers into running malicious container images.
3. **Execution**: Once inside, attackers abuse command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries. This includes executing shell or Python scripts and downloading scripts or binaries from remote sources.
4. **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**: Adversaries use various methods to maintain access and escalate privileges, including creating new user accounts, using LD_PRELOAD, and mounting hostPath volumes.
5. **Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Command and Control**: Attackers employ several techniques to evade detection, collect credentials, and establish command and control channels, including the use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
6. **Exfiltration**: The ultimate goal includes exfiltrating sensitive information, such as AWS credentials.

Given this sequence, the question asks whether, after gaining initial access through exposed Docker API ports, it is likely that attackers will execute cryptocurrency mining scripts before achieving their objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Access**: The report clearly states that attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports to gain access.
- **Execution**: After gaining access, abusing command interpreters to execute malicious scripts or binaries is a documented TTP.
- **Objective**: The report mentions a massive attack against platforms like GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, where crypto miners were executed during the auto-build of an image process, targeting supply-chain processes. This indicates that executing cryptocurrency mining scripts is indeed part of the attackers' tactics.
- **Resource Hijacking**: The use of malicious container images to hijack resources is also a stated goal, aligning with the concept of resource hijacking.

**Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is plausible that after deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts and exploiting exposed Docker API ports, attackers would abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts as part of their campaign. This action aligns with their tactics of executing malicious scripts and their objective of resource hijacking through malicious means, including the execution of crypto miners during the auto-build process of images.

**Final Answer**: A
