To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attack started with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email, which contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo.
     2. **Execution**: Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain presence and execute their backdoor. They created scheduled tasks for persistence and executed commands via scripts. Additional variants of Pterodo were executed, and a VNC client was installed.
     3. **Persistence**: Scheduled tasks were created to execute malicious VBS files every few minutes, ensuring the backdoor remained active.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Shuckworm used mshta.exe, scheduled tasks, and VBS scripts to evade detection.
     5. **Collection**: Multiple variants of the custom VBS backdoor were deployed, and VBS scripts were executed, possibly for collecting and exfiltrating sensitive information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing VBS scripts and HTA files and deploying additional Pterodo variants, Shuckworm is likely to establish command and control using HTTP requests and interacting with C&C servers (like deep-pitched.enarto.ru) before downloading additional payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that Shuckworm used various tactics to maintain presence and evade detection, including the execution of scripts and the use of scheduled tasks.
   - It mentions the deployment of additional variants of Pterodo and the installation of a VNC client as part of the attack.
   - The question implies a next step in the attack sequence involving command and control (C2) communication, which is a common step after initial compromise and establishing persistence.
   - Establishing C2 communication often involves interacting with C&C servers, which could be done using HTTP requests or other protocols.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP requests for C2 communication but does discuss the use of various tools and techniques for persistence and evasion, which suggests a capability for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and tactics used by Shuckworm, which include initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and collection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that establishing command and control is a critical step in the attack sequence, typically following initial compromise and persistence.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Shuckworm, including their use of custom backdoors, VBS scripts, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of Shuckworm using HTTP requests to interact with C&C servers for command and control, given their demonstrated capabilities and the common practices of threat actors.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the common practices of threat actors, it is plausible that Shuckworm would establish command and control using HTTP requests and interact with C&C servers before downloading additional payloads.

Final Answer: A
