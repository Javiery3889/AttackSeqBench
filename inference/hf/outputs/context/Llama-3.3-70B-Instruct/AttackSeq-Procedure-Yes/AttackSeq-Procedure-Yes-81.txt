To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes OnionDog malware, which is transmitted through vulnerabilities in Hangul software or via a USB worm to attack network-isolated targets.
   - It uses darkweb ("Onion City") communications tools to hide its real identity in the Tor network.
   - The malware is known to infiltrate the target internal network by using a USB disk drive to circumvent network isolation, similar to the Stuxnet virus.
   - The report mentions that OnionDog has been active in infiltrating and stealing information from infrastructure industries in Korean-language countries, with a pattern of activity that includes a self-set lifecycle of a Trojan attack averaging 15 days.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after infiltrating the target internal network through a USB worm, OnionDog is likely to establish communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server and download other malware for further operations.
   - The question focuses on the post-infiltration actions of the OnionDog malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that OnionDog uses Onion City (a method of communicating through the Tor network without the Onion browser) for its communications, which implies a level of sophistication in hiding its command and control operations.
   - The report mentions the use of C&C domains and IPs related to OnionDog, suggesting that communication with a C&C server is part of its operation.
   - Given the organizational and objective-oriented nature of OnionDog's attacks, as well as its ability to generate USB worms and use advanced communication methods, it is reasonable to infer that establishing communication with a C&C server for downloading additional malware would be a plausible next step in its operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary method of infiltration used by OnionDog, which is through USB worms to bypass physical isolation.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the sophisticated communication method used by OnionDog, involving the Tor network and Onion City, which facilitates hidden communication.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the organizational and objective-oriented nature of OnionDog's attacks, suggesting a structured approach to its operations.
   - **Step 4**: Infer that, given the use of C&C servers and IPs in its operations, OnionDog likely communicates with these servers to download additional malware for further operations after initial infiltration.
   
**Final Answer: A**
