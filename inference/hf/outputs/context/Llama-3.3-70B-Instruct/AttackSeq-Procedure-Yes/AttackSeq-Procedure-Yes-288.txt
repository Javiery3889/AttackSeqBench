To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Dropping Elephant group.
   - **Initial Access**: The group uses spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and exploits (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution**: They use a UPX-packed backdoor that downloads additional malware from a C2 server.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Encoded blobs are decoded to PowerShell scripts to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access**: Steals user credentials, including Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Collection**: Collects specific file types and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control**: Regularly pings the C2 server, with resilient communications through encrypted locations in comments on legitimate websites.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after targeting entities to gather victim identity information, Dropping Elephant is likely to use spear-phishing emails with malicious documents to gain initial access before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves **Initial Access** through spear-phishing and then **Execution** of UPX-packed backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing with malicious documents (exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352) for initial access.
   - After gaining access, they execute a UPX-packed backdoor that downloads additional malware, aligning with the execution phase described.
   - The question essentially describes the initial phases of the attack as outlined in the CTI report, focusing on initial access via spear-phishing and the subsequent execution of malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by Dropping Elephant, which is spear-phishing with malicious documents.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the action taken after initial access, which involves executing a UPX-packed backdoor to download additional malware.
   - **Step 3**: Compare these steps with the question, which asks if this sequence is likely after targeting entities to gather victim identity information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, the sequence described in the question (using spear-phishing emails with malicious documents for initial access and then executing UPX-packed backdoors) aligns with the known TTPs of Dropping Elephant.

Final Answer: A
