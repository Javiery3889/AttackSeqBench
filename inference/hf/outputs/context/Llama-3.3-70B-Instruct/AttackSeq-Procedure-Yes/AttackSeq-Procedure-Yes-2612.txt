To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack dubbed 'Domestic Kitten' where attackers use mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information from victims' devices.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Victims are tricked into downloading malicious mobile applications.
     2. **Collection**: The malware collects various data from the victims' devices, including contact lists, phone call records, SMS messages, browser history, geo-location, photos, and voice recordings.
     3. The stolen data is sent back to the attackers' command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting sensitive information during the Collection phase, it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves collecting data and then potentially using a specific protocol for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that the attackers collect sensitive information from the victims' devices.
   - The report specifically mentions that the stolen data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol used for transferring data over the web.
   - Therefore, the use of HTTP POST requests aligns with the question's mention of an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method used by attackers to collect data - They use mobile applications loaded with spyware.
   - **Step 2**: Determine how the collected data is sent back to the attackers - The data is sent using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Step 3**: Assess if HTTP POST requests qualify as an application layer protocol - Yes, HTTP is an application-layer protocol.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude if the attackers' infrastructure is likely to receive stolen data over an application layer protocol - Given the use of HTTP POST requests, the answer is affirmative.
   
Final Answer: A
