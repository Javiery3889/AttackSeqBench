To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes FIN13's tactics, which include:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution.
     4. **Persistence**: Using methods like trojanized KeePass binaries and deploying malware.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizing tools like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employing passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for stealth.
     7. **Discovery**: Leveraging native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI to execute commands remotely.
     9. **Collection**: Collecting data from network shared drives.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using proxies and protocols for command and control.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we see that FIN13 indeed uses native OS binaries for **Discovery** (reconnaissance) purposes, which includes gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - Additionally, FIN13 is known to use tools like ProcDump for **Privilege Escalation**, which involves dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
   - The sequence of using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before attempting to escalate privileges (which would include dumping LSASS process memory) aligns with a logical attack progression. Reconnaissance would provide necessary information about the network and hosts, which could then be used to plan and execute privilege escalation techniques effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13 conducts reconnaissance as part of their operations, which includes gathering network and host configurations.
   - **Step 2**: They use native OS binaries as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
   - **Step 3**: Dumping LSASS process memory is a method used by FIN13 for privilege escalation to obtain credentials.
   - **Step 4**: Logically, reconnaissance would precede privilege escalation in an attack sequence, as understanding the network and host configurations would facilitate more targeted and effective attempts at escalating privileges.
   - **Conclusion**: Given FIN13's tactics and the logical progression of a cyber attack, it is likely that they would gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries before attempting to dump LSASS process memory for credential extraction.

Final Answer: A
