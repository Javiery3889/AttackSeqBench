To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Hidden Cobra group targeting financial organizations, particularly in Turkey.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     2. **Resource Development**: Bankshot malware implant is prepared and distributed from a malicious domain.
     3. **Initial Access**: Financial organizations are targeted via spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
     4. **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Bankshot is designed to evade detection.
     6. **Command and Control**: The implants communicate with control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access is gained through spear phishing, the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves initial access, exploitation, and communication with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after initial access, the Bankshot implant is executed, allowing for persistence and further exploitation.
   - It specifically mentions that the implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers.
   - The question essentially asks if this communication with control servers, as part of the command and control tactic, occurs after the initial access and exploitation via the malicious Word document.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - The report states that initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an Adobe Flash exploit.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the action after initial access - After the exploit is executed, the Bankshot implant is deployed.
   - **Step 3**: Assess the communication with control servers - The report explicitly states that the implants communicate with control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is logical to conclude that after initial access is gained and the Bankshot implant is executed, it will indeed communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files.

Final Answer: A
