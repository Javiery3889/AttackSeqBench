To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Rocket Kitten group used spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to infect systems with the CWoolger keylogger.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The GHOLE malware campaign used techniques like a .DLL file with a misleading export function name and hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication to evade detection. The CWoolger keylogger created a mutex and a VBScript for persistence.
   - **Others:** Provides context about the targets, the nature of the malware, and the potential sponsorship of the threat actor group.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing persistence and defense evasion mechanisms (using 'wsc.vbs' and creating a mutex named 'woolger'), it is likely that the GHOLE malware will communicate with its C&C servers and the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to these servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the GHOLE malware uses hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication, which suggests it is designed to communicate with C&C servers.
   - The CWoolger keylogger's purpose is to capture keystrokes, implying it would need to send this data back to the C&C servers for the attackers to utilize.
   - The specific detail about uploading keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes is not mentioned in the report, but given the keylogger's function, it's plausible that once the keylogger has enough data (potentially exceeding 3,000 bytes), it would upload this to the C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The GHOLE malware and CWoolger keylogger are designed for stealthy operations, including evasion techniques and persistence mechanisms.
   - The primary goal of a keylogger is to capture and exfiltrate keystroke data.
   - The use of C&C servers by the GHOLE malware for communication suggests a mechanism for data exfiltration.
   - While the report does not specify the size of the data to be uploaded, the functionality of the malware and keylogger implies that they are designed to send collected data back to the attackers.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing persistence and defense evasion mechanisms, the GHOLE malware would indeed communicate with its C&C servers, and the CWoolger keylogger would upload keystroke logs, including those exceeding 3,000 bytes, as part of its operational design.

**Final Answer: A**
