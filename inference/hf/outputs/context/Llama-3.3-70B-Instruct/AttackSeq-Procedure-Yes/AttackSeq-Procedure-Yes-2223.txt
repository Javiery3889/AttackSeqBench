To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca, a threat actor. The key points relevant to the question include:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Earth Lusca used various tools and commands to gather information about the target network, including user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Discovery**: The threat actor used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner to discover machines in the compromised network environment. This indicates an interest in mapping out the network.
   - **Command and Control**: Earth Lusca established C&C servers and used techniques to mimic normal traffic, avoiding detection. This implies the ability to communicate with compromised systems remotely.
   - **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**: While not directly stated in the provided snippet, the use of tools like PowerSploit and the exploitation of vulnerabilities suggest capabilities for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if, after employing scanning tools during the discovery phase, it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers. This involves analyzing the threat actor's potential next steps after discovering network assets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The discovery phase's use of scanning tools indicates Earth Lusca's interest in understanding the network layout and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
   - The threat actor's capability to establish C&C servers and use encrypted channels for communication suggests they have the means to remotely control compromised systems.
   - Exploiting remote services and engaging in lateral movement would be a logical next step after discovering potential targets within the network, as it aligns with the goal of expanding access and control within the compromised network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Earth Lusca has demonstrated the ability to discover network assets using scanning tools.
   - **Step 2**: They have shown capabilities in establishing command and control channels, which could be used for lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: The goal of lateral movement is often to expand access, which aligns with exploiting remote services and establishing network tunnels for further exploitation or exfiltration.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Earth Lusca's demonstrated capabilities and the logical progression of a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after employing scanning tools, they would likely exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement.

Final Answer: A
