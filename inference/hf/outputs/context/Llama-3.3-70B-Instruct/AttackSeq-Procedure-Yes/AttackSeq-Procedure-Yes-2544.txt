To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: PowerShell scripts and batch file execution to download and run additional files, including the Milestone backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself and creating a service.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Creation of a new administrator user and execution of the backdoor with elevated privileges.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Use of a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide malicious artifacts.
     6. **Discovery**: Milestone backdoor discovers system information, files, directories, and captures screens.
     7. **Command and Control**: Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves discovery capabilities followed by potential data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions the Milestone backdoor's capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - The report also mentions that the Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server, which could be used for exfiltrating data.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that data exfiltration occurs after discovery, the backdoor's communication with a C2 server and its discovery capabilities suggest it has the potential to exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities of the Milestone backdoor, which include system discovery and communication with a C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the typical behavior of backdoors, which often include data exfiltration as part of their functionality.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the context provided by the CTI report, which suggests a sophisticated campaign with multiple components, including a backdoor and a rootkit, indicating a high likelihood of data exfiltration as part of the attack's objectives.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the Milestone backdoor's capabilities and the context of the attack, it is reasonable to conclude that data exfiltration over the C2 channel is a likely part of the attack sequence after system discovery and screen capture.

Final Answer: A
