To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Hidden Cobra targeting Turkish financial organizations.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     2. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to execute arbitrary code.
     3. **Execution**: The exploit downloads and executes the Bankshot implant.
     4. **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Bankshot evades detection and can wipe files from the targeted system.
     6. **Command and Control**: The implant communicates with control servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access, it's likely that Hidden Cobra will develop Bankshot implants to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files under the tactic of Resource Development.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves developing capabilities for full control and file wiping.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report already indicates that Bankshot has capabilities for persistence and defense evasion, including wiping files and content to erase evidence or perform destructive actions.
   - The question essentially asks if developing such capabilities aligns with the tactic of Resource Development, which involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations.
   - Given that Bankshot is designed for persistence and has destructive capabilities, it suggests that Hidden Cobra is indeed interested in developing resources (in this case, malware capabilities) that can provide full control over victim systems and facilitate further malicious activities, such as data destruction or exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the current capabilities of Bankshot as described in the CTI report, which include persistence, defense evasion, and file wiping.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the tactic of Resource Development in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves creating, buying, or stealing resources (like malware) to support operations.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that developing Bankshot with enhanced capabilities for full control and file wiping aligns with the goals of Resource Development, as it enhances the attackers' ability to exploit victim systems.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the nature of Resource Development, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would continue to develop Bankshot implants with such capabilities.

Final Answer: A
