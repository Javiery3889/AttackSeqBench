To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack starts with vulnerability scanning of the target server, followed by the injection of a web shell code.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery, and then penetrate the internal network.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan has two main components: a main executable binary and a DLL file. The DLL is dynamically loaded and unloaded as needed.
   - **Persistence:** Explosive can be installed under various service names and paths, and it uses several files and directories for its operation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan evades detection by frequently changing versions, monitoring memory consumption, and using custom configurations.
   - **Credential Access:** The Explosive Trojan uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** A multi-tiered server backend framework is used to control targeted systems.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining access to administrator passwords, the Explosive Trojan is likely to use writable mass storage devices (infected through a configurable USB infection option) for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report mentions that once the attackers are in control of a server, they "further penetrate the targeted internal network via various means, including manual online hacking as well as an automated USB infection mechanism." This indicates that the use of USB infection for lateral movement is a part of their tactics.
   - The report also details the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control after the initial access and execution phases.
   - Given that the question specifies the scenario after gaining access to administrator passwords (Credential Access), it's logical to consider how the attackers would proceed with Lateral Movement and then Command and Control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gain initial access to a server.
   - They use keylogging for Credential Access to obtain administrator passwords.
   - With these credentials, they can move laterally within the network. The report mentions an "automated USB infection mechanism" as one of the means for further penetrating the internal network, which aligns with the use of writable mass storage devices for Lateral Movement.
   - After establishing a foothold and potentially spreading within the network, they would use a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information in the CTI report and the logical progression of the attack, it is plausible that the Explosive Trojan would use writable mass storage devices infected through a configurable USB infection option for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

Final Answer: A
