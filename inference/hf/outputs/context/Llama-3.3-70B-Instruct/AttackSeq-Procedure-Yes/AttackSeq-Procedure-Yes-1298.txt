To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193) via an email with a malicious Excel document.
     2. **Execution**: User Execution (T1204) through exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
     3. **Credential Access**: Techniques include Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214).
     4. **Collection**: Data from Local System (T1005).
     5. **Command and Control**: Using Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071).
     6. **Exfiltration**: Data Encrypted (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of employing File Deletion (T1107) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of File Deletion (T1107) as a technique. However, the question is about the plausibility of this technique being used between the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 and the stealing of credentials.
   - Defense evasion techniques, including File Deletion, are commonly used by attackers to hide their tracks and avoid detection. Given that the attackers have already demonstrated sophistication by using a hidden object in an Excel document to exploit a vulnerability silently, it's reasonable to consider that they might employ additional evasion techniques.
   - However, the specific sequence and techniques used can depend on the attackers' goals and the tools at their disposal. The report highlights the use of specific malware and exploits but does not detail every step taken for defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and the point of interest (between exploitation and credential stealing).
   - **Step 2**: Consider the nature of the attack and the sophistication of the attackers.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of using File Deletion as part of defense evasion based on common attacker behaviors and the information provided.
   - Given the attackers' demonstrated ability to use sophisticated tactics and the common use of defense evasion techniques in similar attacks, it's plausible they might use File Deletion. However, the report does not directly support this conclusion, and the question asks for a likelihood based on the provided sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: The attackers have shown sophistication, and defense evasion is a common practice. However, without explicit mention or strong implication of File Deletion in the provided sequence, the most cautious answer based on the information given would lean towards it not being explicitly mentioned or implied as a necessary step in the sequence provided.

Final Answer: B
