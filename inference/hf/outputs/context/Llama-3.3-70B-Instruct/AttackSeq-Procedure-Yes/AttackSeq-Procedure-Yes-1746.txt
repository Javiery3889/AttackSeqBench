To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by TG1021, and then match this information with the details in the question.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 conducted reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
   - **Execution:** Executed sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** Utilized web shells and a custom malware framework for persistence, with a focus on in-memory operations.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used custom tools and techniques for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Actively avoided detection by interfering with logging and evading EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** Modified login webpages to capture credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Used tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, loading them into memory without disk presence.
   - **Command and Control:** Established C2 using an inline hook on an IIS validation function.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question focuses on the actions taken by TG1021 after the Discovery phase, specifically after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - It asks if TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI report details TG1021's sophisticated and stealthy approach, focusing on in-memory operations and evasion techniques.
   - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit directly in memory for reconnaissance suggests a careful approach to avoid detection.
   - The question implies a lateral movement tactic involving accessing shared folders over SMB and deploying a web shell loader.
   - Given TG1021's demonstrated ability to exploit IIS servers initially and their use of web shells for persistence, it's plausible they would attempt to compromise additional servers.
   - The mention of NodeIISWeb providing backdoor functionality aligns with the idea of using a web shell loader for further compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - TG1021 has shown the capability and intent to exploit web servers and use web shells.
   - Their methods include sophisticated evasion techniques and in-memory operations, indicating a preference for stealthy and efficient tactics.
   - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance suggests an interest in mapping and understanding the target environment, which would be a precursor to lateral movement.
   - Deploying a web shell loader like NodeIISWeb to compromise additional servers via SMB would be consistent with their observed TTPs, especially given their focus on web server exploitation and the use of similar tools for persistence and C2.

**Final Answer: A**
