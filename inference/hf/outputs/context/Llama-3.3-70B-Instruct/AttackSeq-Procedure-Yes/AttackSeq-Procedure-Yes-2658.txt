To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Execution involves a custom loader exploiting a side-loading vulnerability to load the Korplug variant.
   - Persistence is established through creating a hidden directory and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry.
   - Defense evasion techniques include control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption.
   - Discovery involves collecting system information.
   - Collection includes gathering data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - Exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting metadata and content, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands, involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body. This indicates that Korplug does use a custom TCP-based protocol for communication and data exfiltration.
   - The question specifies communication over non-standard ports, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report. However, the use of a custom protocol suggests flexibility in communication methods, which could include the use of non-standard ports.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of data exfiltration used by Korplug according to the CTI report. The report states that exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the question's description of the communication method aligns with the report's description of Korplug's exfiltration method. The question describes a custom TCP-based protocol, which aligns with the report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the implication of using a "custom protocol" for communication. This implies a level of flexibility and potential for using various methods, including non-standard ports, for communication.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis. Given that the report confirms the use of a custom protocol for exfiltration and the question's description aligns with this, the most plausible answer is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
