To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infects systems through social engineering tactics, exploiting vulnerabilities in Adobe products, or by disguising executables as images or documents.
   - **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, with various compilation dates indicating updates over time.
   - **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service, allowing it to start the malware using a duplicated process token.
   - **Credential Access**: It targets various software and Windows credentials for theft, including passwords, hashes, and certificates.
   - **Discovery**: The malware searches for specific file types on hard drives and network drives, targeting documents, archives, and files related to encryption.
   - **Command and Control**: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for data exfiltration and updates.
   - **Exfiltration**: Collected data is uploaded to remote servers via FTP, with detailed login credentials and folder structures provided.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types, CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating data via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details CosmicDuke's capabilities, including its ability to steal credentials, search for specific files, and exfiltrate data. However, it specifically mentions the theft of credentials, certificates, and files but does not explicitly mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers as part of its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - The report focuses on CosmicDuke's file and credential theft capabilities, its persistence mechanisms, and its communication with command and control servers for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary methods of data collection mentioned in the report, which include credential theft and file searching.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the report explicitly mentions the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It does not.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the nature of the malware's operations, which are focused on stealing specific types of data (credentials, files) and exfiltrating them.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided. Given that the report does not mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers, and instead focuses on other methods of data collection, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke is not described as using these specific tools for gathering information before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
