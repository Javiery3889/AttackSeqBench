To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence of RIG EK, starting with **Initial Access** through malvertising or compromised sites, leading to the execution of RIG exploits.
   - **Execution** involves running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control** infrastructure includes proxy servers and an API server to serve exploits.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing commands on victim machines, RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting them to its landing page.
   - The question essentially inquires about the method of initial access and exploitation used by RIG EK.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript. This is the initial access method.
   - The question seems to imply a sequence where after gaining initial access and executing commands, RIG EK would then use malvertising to redirect users. However, the report suggests that malvertising is a method used for initial access, not necessarily a step that occurs after executing commands on victim machines.
   - The confusion may arise from interpreting the question's phrasing about "after using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands." This could be seen as part of the exploitation process (Execution phase) rather than the initial access phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report indicates that RIG EK uses malvertising as a method for initial access, to redirect users to its exploit kit.
   - The question seems to ask if, after initial exploitation, RIG EK would use malvertising again in the same way. However, the primary use of malvertising described is for initial access, not as a subsequent step after exploitation.
   - Given the information, the most direct interpretation of the question based on the report's details suggests that the primary method of delivering exploits involves malvertising for initial access, which aligns with the report's description.
   - Therefore, considering the question's phrasing and the report's details, the answer should reflect whether RIG EK's method of delivering exploits aligns with using malvertising for initial access.

Final Answer: A
