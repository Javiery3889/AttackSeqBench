To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes ZoxPNG, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses the PNG image file format for data transmission with its Command and Control (C2) server.
   - It supports executing arbitrary code from the C2 server and requires the attacker to specify the C2 server address as a command line argument.
   - Upon activation, ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.
   - For Command and Control, ZoxPNG communicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests, with the first request being a GET request to establish initial contact.
   - The report mentions that ZoxPNG is resilient to network instability and uses a polling model for communication, retrying connections multiple times.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after ZoxPNG begins communication with the victim's machine (via the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion), it is likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request for command and control.
   - The question focuses on the method of initial contact with the C2 server after ZoxPNG has started interacting with the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that ZoxPNG uses HTTP requests for communication with the C2 server and that the first request is a GET request to establish initial contact.
   - The question specifies the use of the WinInet API for exploiting proxy settings, which is a method for defense evasion but does not directly impact the method of communication with the C2 server as described in the report.
   - Given that the report explicitly states the first contact with the C2 server is via a GET request, and there's no information suggesting this changes based on the use of the WinInet API for proxy settings exploitation, the most logical conclusion is that the initial contact would indeed be through an HTTP GET request.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method ZoxPNG uses for initial contact with the C2 server according to the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Consider if the use of the WinInet API for exploiting proxy settings would change the method of initial contact with the C2 server.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report specifies the initial contact method as an HTTP GET request and there's no indication this would change due to the use of the WinInet API, conclude that the initial contact would likely be through an HTTP GET request.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the most plausible sequence of events is that ZoxPNG would establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request after beginning communication with the victim's machine.

Final Answer: A
