To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Mustang Panda using spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files.
   - These files contain embedded HTA scripts that drop and open decoy documents while running malicious payloads in the background.
   - The payloads include Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX malware.
   - Defense evasion techniques include the use of double extension tricks (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) to deceive users.
   - The report mentions the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike, which are known for their capabilities in establishing command and control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after evading defenses using the double extension trick, Mustang Panda is likely to use documents attempting to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.
   - This implies an examination of the post-exploitation phase, specifically focusing on the communication strategy of the attackers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report highlights the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike, which are tools commonly used for establishing C2 communications.
   - The question essentially asks if the attackers would use documents (or more broadly, their malware payloads) to communicate with C2 servers.
   - Given that PlugX and Cobalt Strike are designed to establish such communications, and considering the context of the attack aiming to deliver these payloads, it is reasonable to infer that establishing C2 communications would be a subsequent step in the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the attack, which is to deliver malicious payloads (PlugX and Cobalt Strike) to the victim's system.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the capabilities of the delivered payloads, specifically their ability to establish C2 communications.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the attack, including the use of defense evasion techniques to ensure the payloads are executed.
   - **Step 4**: Infer the likely next steps in the attack sequence, given the tools and techniques used.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike, which are known for their C2 communication capabilities, and the context of the attack aiming to evade defenses to deliver these payloads, it is logical to conclude that Mustang Panda would indeed attempt to establish C2 communications as part of their strategy.

Final Answer: A
