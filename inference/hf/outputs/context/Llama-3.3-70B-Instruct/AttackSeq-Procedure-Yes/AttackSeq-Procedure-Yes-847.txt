To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack sequence ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, starting from Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and finally Exfiltration.
   - The key phases relevant to the question are Discovery, and the actions that follow, such as lateral movement and establishing persistence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the discovery phase, attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
   - This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically employed by attackers after they have discovered relevant systems, users, and data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The discovery phase is about exploring the target network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - After discovery, the next logical steps for an attacker would involve moving laterally within the network to reach targeted systems or data. This often requires exploiting remote services to gain access to other systems.
   - Establishing persistence points is crucial for maintaining access, but the question specifically asks about the sequence after discovery and before potentially installing additional persistence points on new systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Discovery** provides the necessary knowledge about the network layout, system vulnerabilities, and potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement** is a natural next step, which can involve exploiting remote services to move between systems without being detected.
   - The question implies a sequence where **lateral movement** (potentially through exploiting remote services) occurs as a means to reach new systems before the attackers would **install additional persistence points** on those systems. This makes sense because an attacker would first need to gain access to a system (through lateral movement) before they could install persistence mechanisms on it.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase would indeed involve exploiting remote services for lateral movement as a precursor to installing additional persistence points on new systems. This aligns with the tactics typically employed by attackers to spread within a network and maintain access.

**Final Answer: A**
