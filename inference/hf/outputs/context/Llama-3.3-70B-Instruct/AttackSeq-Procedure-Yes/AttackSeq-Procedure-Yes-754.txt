To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with the execution of a malicious XLS attachment containing a VB macro.
   - This macro silently downloads a malicious MSI package.
   - The MSI package is then installed, which includes installing legitimate Lua dependencies, a modified Windows Lua interpreter, and a malicious Lua script named SunSeed.
   - The report specifically mentions that the MSI package establishes persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after the malicious XLS attachment uses a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package, it is likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - The question directly references the sequence of events described in the CTI report, focusing on the outcome of the MSI package installation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the MSI package installs an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup as a method of establishing persistence.
   - This directly aligns with the scenario presented in the question, indicating that the installation of the MSI package indeed includes achieving persistence through the installation of an LNK file for autorun.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial attack vector and the action taken by the malicious XLS attachment, which is the execution of a VB macro to download an MSI package silently.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the purpose and content of the MSI package, which includes establishing persistence.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate how persistence is achieved according to the report, which is through the installation of an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the sequence of events described in the question matches the attack sequence outlined in the CTI report, specifically regarding the establishment of persistence.
