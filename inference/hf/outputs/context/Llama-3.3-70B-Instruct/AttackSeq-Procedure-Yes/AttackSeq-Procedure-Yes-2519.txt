To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the BlueDelta campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Targeting Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure, exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for reconnaissance and exfiltration.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gained by exploiting Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730, and also exploiting a Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397.
     3. **Execution**: Executing malicious scripts through Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscation techniques.
     5. **Credential Access**: Accessing credentials by exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     6. **Collection**: Collecting emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.
     7. **Command and Control**: Using web protocols for command and control.
     8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over alternative protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access before exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities focused on gathering information such as system and network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the BlueDelta campaign did indeed exploit CVE-2020-35730 for initial access to the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers.
   - Following initial access, the campaign executed malicious scripts that could be used for discovery activities, such as reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server, which aligns with gathering system and network configurations.
   - The report explicitly mentions the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts, which includes redirecting incoming emails and performing reconnaissance on the target server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by the BlueDelta campaign, which was the exploitation of CVE-2020-35730.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the campaign conducted discovery activities after initial access. The report mentions reconnaissance activities, including redirecting emails and performing reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate if these activities align with gathering system and network configurations. The exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities for reconnaissance purposes suggests that such information could be gathered.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access before exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities.

Final Answer: A
