To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193) via an email with a malicious Excel document.
     2. **Execution**: User Execution (T1204) through a hidden object in the Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
     3. **Credential Access**: Techniques include Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214).
     4. **Collection**: Data from Local System (T1005).
     5. **Command and Control**: Using Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071).
     6. **Exfiltration**: Data Encrypted (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing hidden objects in an Excel document for silent code execution, it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing Hidden Files and Directories (T1158) before searching for and extracting credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, followed by credential access techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of Hidden Files and Directories (T1158) as a step before credential access.
   - The question implies a sequence where after the initial execution (exploiting CVE-2017-11882), the attacker might hide artifacts (T1158) before proceeding with credential access techniques (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - Given the nature of the attack, which involves stealthy techniques like silent code execution, it is plausible that the attacker would attempt to hide artifacts to avoid detection. This would align with typical adversary tactics to remain undetected on a compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial attack vector and execution method, which involves exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the subsequent actions an attacker would take to maintain stealth and successfully extract credentials without being detected.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of employing Hidden Files and Directories (T1158) as a tactic to hide artifacts before engaging in credential access activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack and typical adversary behavior, it is reasonable to assume that hiding artifacts would be a strategic step to avoid detection before proceeding with credential extraction.

Final Answer: A
