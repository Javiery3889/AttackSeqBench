To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Moafee and DragonOK groups.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: The groups use similar TTPs, including custom-built backdoors and RATs, and publicly available tools.
   - **Initial Access**: The primary attack vector is spear-phishing emails with tailored attachments.
   - **Execution**: The groups use evasion techniques, including environment-based evasion (like CPU core checks) to detect and avoid sandbox environments.
   - **Persistence**: Registry entries are used for startup persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Techniques include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control**: The backdoors and RATs use specific communication methods, including network beacons with hardcoded header values and encrypted data.

2. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via spear-phishing, it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development before using environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks to execute their payloads.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after initial access (via spear-phishing emails), the groups indeed employ custom-built backdoors and RATs (such as CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog) to maintain access to victim networks.
   - The report also details the use of evasion techniques, including the CPU core check, which is part of the first-stage payload for RATs like CT/NewCT. This technique is used to detect the number of processor cores in the running environment, likely to avoid detection in virtualized environments.
   - The sequence of events suggested by the question—using custom-built backdoors and RATs after initial access and before employing evasion techniques like CPU core checks—aligns with the tactics described in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Moafee and DragonOK use spear-phishing emails as their primary attack vector for initial access.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, they utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs as part of their resource development to support their operations. This is consistent with the report's description of their use of such tools for maintaining access.
   - **Step 3**: The groups then use environment-based evasion techniques, such as the CPU core check, as part of executing their payloads. This is a defense evasion technique aimed at avoiding detection in sandbox environments.

Given the information in the CTI report and the sequence of TTPs described, it is reasonable to conclude that the answer to the question is affirmative. The groups do leverage custom-built backdoors and RATs after initial access and before using evasion techniques like CPU core checks.

**Final Answer: A**
