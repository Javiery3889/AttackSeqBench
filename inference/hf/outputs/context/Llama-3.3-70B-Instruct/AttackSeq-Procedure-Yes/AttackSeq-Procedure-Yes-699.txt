To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the Elderwood Project, a group known for targeting various industries with zero-day exploits.
   - It mentions the use of an "Elderwood platform" for deploying these exploits.
   - The group has been linked to significant attacks, including the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack.
   - The report specifically mentions the establishment of command and control (C&C) servers by the attackers to control compromised systems and retrieve commands.
   - The identified C&C domains (e.g., qwby.gownsman.com, wwwcnas.org, gate-usa.com) are used for maintaining control over victim computers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via watering hole attacks using zero-day exploits, it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers to maintain control and retrieve commands.
   - The question essentially inquires about the next step in the attack sequence after initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know the Elderwood Project attackers do use zero-day exploits for initial access and have been observed setting up C&C servers.
   - The report directly states that these C&C servers are used to "control compromised systems" and "retrieve commands from the attackers," which aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - Given the attackers' systematic approach, technical capability, and the purpose of the Elderwood platform, it is logical that establishing C&C servers would be a crucial step after initial access to maintain control and execute further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method mentioned in the question - zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the purpose of C&C servers as described in the CTI report - to control compromised systems and retrieve commands.
   - **Step 3**: Connect the initial access method with the establishment of C&C servers as a logical sequence of actions for maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that based on the CTI report, the Elderwood Project attackers' modus operandi includes establishing C&C servers after gaining initial access, which matches the scenario described in the question.

Final Answer: A
