To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gholee malware campaign, which starts with a spear phishing attack using a malicious Excel file.
   - The malware uses obfuscation techniques, including ASCII character codes, to avoid detection.
   - It employs mechanisms to hide from debuggers and sandbox software.
   - The report mentions communication with an IP address in the same netblock as the Gholee malware but does not directly link this to the Gholee malware's post-obfuscation actions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after obfuscating its entry point, the Gholee malware is likely to establish communication with an IP address, use an expired digital certificate, and send HTTP communication for Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - The question focuses on the post-obfuscation behavior of the malware, specifically regarding its communication methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does mention the malware's ability to evade detection and hide from debuggers and sandbox software, which aligns with the premise of the question about post-obfuscation behavior.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that the malware uses an expired digital certificate or sends HTTP communication for C2 operations after evading defenses.
   - The mention of communication with an IP address (83.170.33.37) in the same netblock as the Gholee malware, related to another file ('svchost 67.exe'), suggests that communication with IP addresses might be part of the malware's or the threat actor's behavior, but this is not directly linked to the Gholee malware's actions after obfuscation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Gholee malware's primary goal, like many malware types, is to establish a foothold within a victim's system and potentially communicate back to its command and control servers.
   - **Step 2**: The use of obfuscation and evasion techniques is common among malware to avoid detection, which the Gholee malware employs.
   - **Step 3**: While the report does not explicitly detail the Gholee malware's post-obfuscation communication methods, the fact that it's designed to evade detection suggests it would likely attempt to communicate with its C2 servers.
   - **Step 4**: The mention of another file communicating with an IP address in the same netblock implies that the threat actor might use such communication methods, but this is not directly attributed to the Gholee malware's behavior after evading detection.
   - **Step 5**: Given the information provided and the common behaviors of malware, it's plausible that the Gholee malware would attempt to establish communication for C2 operations, but the specifics about using an expired digital certificate and sending HTTP communication are not directly supported by the report.

Given the analysis, the most direct answer to whether the Gholee malware, after obfuscating its entry point, is likely to establish communication with an IP address (a behavior that can be inferred from related incidents and common malware behaviors), use an expired digital certificate, and send HTTP communication for C2 operations would lean towards the affirmative based on typical malware behavior, despite the report not explicitly detailing these exact actions for the Gholee malware.

**Final Answer: A**
