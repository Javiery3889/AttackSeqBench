To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions two methods for delivering KerrDown: 
     1. Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros.
     2. RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading.
   - **Defense Evasion:** KerrDown uses a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs, and the payload is executed in memory after being decrypted with the DES algorithm.
   - **Command and Control:** The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, downloaded from a URL based on the victim's OS architecture.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after delivering KerrDown, it is likely that the Office document will contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The report does mention the use of Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros as a delivery method for KerrDown. It also mentions the use of base64 blobs for decoding, which aligns with the question's details about using base64 blobs.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that the Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. The mention of an image ('main_background.png') is related to where the KerrDown DLL is dropped, not within the context of the initial Office document or as part of the social engineering tactic to enable macros.
   - The execution of the payload based on the victim's system architecture is consistent with the report, as it mentions the KerrDown downloader attempts to download the payload from a URL depending on the OS architecture of the victim machine.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the delivery methods mentioned in the report (Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros and RAR archives).
   - **Step 2:** Recognize the use of base64 blobs for decoding in the report.
   - **Step 3:** Note the absence of explicit information about an image in the Office document instructing to enable macros.
   - **Step 4:** Understand the payload execution is based on the victim's system architecture, which aligns with the report.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the information provided, the question's specifics about an image instructing the victim to enable macros before executing the payload based on system architecture are not directly supported by the report. The report focuses on the technical aspects of the malware and its delivery but does not detail the social engineering aspect of instructing victims to enable macros via an image in the document.

Final Answer: B
