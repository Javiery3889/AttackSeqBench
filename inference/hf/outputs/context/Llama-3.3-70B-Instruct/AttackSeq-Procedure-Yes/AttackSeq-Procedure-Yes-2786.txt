To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Operation Pawn Storm involving iOS malware, part of the SEDNIT malware family.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The XAgent app is installed, hides its icon (on iOS 7), and runs in the background, restarting if terminated.
   - **Discovery**: The malware collects various information, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting information during the Discovery phase, the malware is likely to use a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to communicate with the Command and Control (C2) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the malware's capabilities, especially its data collection activities during the Discovery phase.
   - The question focuses on the communication method with the C2 server, specifically using a Base64-encoded token.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the communication protocol or the use of Base64-encoded tokens with a 5-byte random prefix. However, the fact that the malware is designed to collect and presumably send back sensitive information suggests it must communicate with a C2 server in some manner.
   - The use of Base64 encoding and random prefixes is a common technique in malware to obscure communication and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware collects sensitive information, which implies it needs to send this data back to the attackers.
   - **Step 2**: Malware often uses encoded communication to avoid detection, and Base64 encoding is a common method for this purpose.
   - **Step 3**: The specific detail about a 5-byte random prefix adds a layer of obfuscation, making it harder to detect the communication.
   - **Step 4**: While the report does not explicitly mention this communication method, the behavior described (collecting and presumably sending data) and the common practices of malware suggest that using an encoded token for C2 communication is plausible.
   
Given the information and the common practices of malware, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware could use such a method to communicate with its C2 server, especially since the question is about the plausibility after the discovery phase, where data collection has occurred.

**Final Answer: A**
