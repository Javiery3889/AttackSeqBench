To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a spear-phishing campaign targeting US-based retailers.
   - **Initial Access** is gained through spear-phishing emails containing malicious MS Office documents that leverage social engineering tactics.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by adding a registry key to launch the RMS executable on user login and by attempting to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process, causing the script to loop.
   - **Defense Evasion** involves using the legitimate RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control** involves the RMS executable attempting to 'call home' to a C2 server in Germany.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails, it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls before a macro downloads malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions the use of social engineering tactics in the phishing emails but does not explicitly state that victims are instructed to disable security controls.
   - The report highlights the use of a legitimate remote administration tool (RMS) to evade security controls, indicating a level of sophistication in avoiding detection without necessarily requiring the victim to manually disable security controls.
   - The focus of the attack seems to be on leveraging the RMS tool's capabilities for persistence, defense evasion, and command and control, rather than on instructing victims to manually disable security controls.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of initial access, which is through spear-phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.
   - **Step 2**: Consider how the threat actors achieve persistence and evade defense mechanisms, which is primarily through the use of the RMS tool.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of victims being instructed to disable security controls based on the information provided. Given the sophisticated use of the RMS tool for evasion and the lack of explicit mention of such instructions in the report, it seems less likely that victims would be required to manually disable security controls.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the nature of the attack, which leverages a legitimate tool for evasion and persistence, it is less likely that the attack sequence would require victims to disable security controls manually.

Final Answer: B
