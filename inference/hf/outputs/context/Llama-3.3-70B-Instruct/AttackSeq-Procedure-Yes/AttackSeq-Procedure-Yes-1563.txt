To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a sophisticated supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, leading to the deployment of a custom backdoor named Sunburst on over 18,000 customer networks.
   - This initial access via Sunburst backdoor is mentioned as allowing for further exploitation.
   - The report also mentions other incidents and actors (like HAFNIUM and the use of Exchange Server zero-days), but these are separate from the SolarWinds incident.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the behavior of the Sunburst backdoor after it has been delivered through a supply-chain attack for initial access.
   - It specifically asks if it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report establishes that the Sunburst backdoor was used for initial access, implying that further actions would be necessary for exploitation.
   - Typically, backdoors like Sunburst are designed to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional malware, which are all part of further exploitation.
   - The question of whether Sunburst communicates with a C2 server is crucial for understanding how the initial access leads to further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the role of the Sunburst backdoor in the attack. It was deployed for initial access, which is the first step in a cyber attack.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that initial access is typically followed by further exploitation, which can include data exfiltration, lateral movement, or deployment of additional malware.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that backdoors, by design, usually communicate with C2 servers to facilitate these further exploitation steps.
   - **Step 4**: Given the sophisticated nature of the supply-chain attack and the custom nature of the Sunburst backdoor, it is reasonable to assume that communication with a C2 server for further instructions or actions would be part of the attack sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of backdoors and the context provided by the CTI report, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A
