To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents that deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The initial access is through phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded VBS macros.
   - Upon execution, a VBS macro runs a PowerShell script that downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - The PowerShell script operates in memory and uses a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk, evading detection.
   - The impact includes file encryption by GandCrab and credential harvesting, system information gathering, and potential deployment of additional malware by Ursnif.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after evading defenses, the PowerShell script is likely to communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The key elements here are the evasion techniques and the subsequent actions of the PowerShell script.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab after evading defenses by operating in memory.
   - The use of the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk is a method to evade detection, which aligns with the question's context.
   - Communicating with C2 servers is implied as part of the process to download these payloads, as the script needs to fetch the malware from somewhere.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the PowerShell script after execution, which is to download and execute malware payloads.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that to download these payloads, the script must communicate with a command and control (C2) server or a similar infrastructure hosting the malware.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the evasion techniques described are meant to facilitate the successful execution of the malware without detection, which includes downloading and running Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given the script's purpose and the context provided, it is logical and necessary for the script to communicate with C2 servers to download the specified malware.

Final Answer: A
