To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses phishing emails as an initial access point for cyber attacks.
   - It mentions the use of sophisticated phishing methods, including sending emails from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain.
   - The report also talks about ransomware attacks involving data exfiltration and encryption, with demands for payment.
   - Other points include the increase in data subject litigation, the importance of preparedness for cyber-attacks, and legal implications of ransom payments.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails.
   - Further actions include lateral movement, exfiltration of data, and ransomware attacks.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial intrusion via phishing emails, threat actors targeting Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will likely gather victim organization information during reconnaissance efforts.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) starting with initial access and potentially followed by reconnaissance.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report establishes that phishing is used as an initial access point, which aligns with the starting point of the question.
   - Reconnaissance is a common step after initial access in many cyber attack sequences, as it allows attackers to gather information about the victim's network, systems, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - The report does not explicitly mention Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks but discusses the importance of understanding and preparing for various types of cyber threats, including those that might involve supply chain attacks (like the ones targeting Solar Winds and Kaseya).
   - Gathering victim organization information is a crucial part of the reconnaissance phase, as it helps attackers plan further actions, such as lateral movement, exfiltration, and potential ransomware deployment.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Phishing emails are used for initial access.
   - After gaining access, attackers typically conduct reconnaissance to understand the network and systems they have accessed.
   - Reconnaissance includes gathering information about the victim organization, which is essential for planning subsequent attacks, such as targeted phishing campaigns within the supply chain or deploying ransomware.
   - The question about gathering victim organization information during reconnaissance efforts after initial access via phishing aligns with common cyber attack TTPs.

6. **Final Answer**:
   Given the information in the CTI report and the typical sequence of cyber attack TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after using phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion, threat actors would likely gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts as part of planning further attacks.

Final Answer: A
