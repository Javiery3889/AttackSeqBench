To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the PurpleFox operator.
   - **Initial Access**: Achieved through PowerShell commands downloading malicious payloads from compromised servers.
   - **Execution**: Involved PowerShell commands downloading a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems, applying hotfixes for specific vulnerabilities, and using PowerSploit or Tater modules to install an MSI package.
   - **Persistence**: The MSI package installed the PurpleFox backdoor, modified registry values, and replaced sens.dll to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
   - **Command and Control**: The FoxSocket backdoor used WebSockets for a secure C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after ensuring persistence, PurpleFox is likely to install a rootkit driver to evade detection and execute a .vbs script to block specific ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the attack sequence up to the establishment of persistence and command and control. It does not explicitly mention the installation of a rootkit driver or the execution of a .vbs script to block ports.
   - However, the report does highlight the backdoor's capabilities, including key negotiations, machine fingerprinting, and executing commands from the server, which suggests a level of sophistication that could include evasive maneuvers.
   - Installing a rootkit driver to hide files and processes and blocking specific ports (like 135, 139, and 445, which are commonly used for Windows networking and could be used by security software or other tools to communicate) could be seen as tactics to further secure the foothold and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence and tactics used by PurpleFox as described.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report does not explicitly mention a rootkit or .vbs script execution for port blocking, these actions align with advanced persistence and evasion techniques.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities of the FoxSocket backdoor and the overall sophistication of the attack.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is plausible that after establishing persistence, PurpleFox could employ additional evasion techniques such as installing a rootkit driver and modifying firewall rules to further secure its presence in the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
