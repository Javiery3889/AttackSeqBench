To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an iOS malware, part of Operation Pawn Storm, which is similar to SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The XAgent app is fully functional, hides its icon, runs in the background, and restarts immediately if terminated on iOS 7 devices.
   - **Command and Control**: The app collects information from the iOS device and sends it via HTTP (using POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing and hiding itself on iOS 7 devices, the XAgent app is likely to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data to its C&C server via HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the malware collects information from the iOS device but does not specifically mention geo-location data.
   - However, given that the malware is described as advanced and similar to SEDNIT malware, which is known for its comprehensive data collection capabilities, it's plausible that geo-location data could be part of the information collected.
   - The fact that the malware sends collected information via HTTP to its C&C server suggests it has the capability to exfiltrate various types of data, potentially including geo-location information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's ability to collect and send information via HTTP suggests a broad data collection capability.
   - **Step 2**: The comparison with SEDNIT malware implies the malware could have advanced data collection features.
   - **Step 3**: While geo-location data is not explicitly mentioned, the malware's advanced nature and communication capabilities make it plausible that such data could be collected as part of its discovery routine.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the malware's capabilities and the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that the XAgent app could collect geo-location data as part of its operations.

Final Answer: A
