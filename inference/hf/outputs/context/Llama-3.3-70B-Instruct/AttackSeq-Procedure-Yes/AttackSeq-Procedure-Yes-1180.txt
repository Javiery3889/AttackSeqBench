To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign with similarities to MuddyWater, targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents with social engineering tactics to trick victims into enabling macros, which then execute the payload.
   - **Execution**: After macros are enabled, the payload creates files in the ProgramData directory, including a .VBS script that executes a PowerShell script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Persistence**: The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The campaigns use obfuscation, and the PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation. There's also an attempt to bypass AppLocker.
   - **Discovery** and **Collection**: The backdoor function collects machine information, takes screenshots, and sends this data to a C&C server.
   - **Others**: The attackers monitor incoming connections to the C&C server, and there are indications of potential false flags in the malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing a backdoor function for Discovery and Collection, it's likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the backdoor function collects machine information, takes screenshots, and sends this data to a C&C server. However, it does not explicitly state that the communication with the C&C server is encrypted.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack, including the use of obfuscation and attempts to bypass security measures like AppLocker, it would be reasonable to assume that the attackers would also use encryption to protect their communication with the C&C server. This would help in evading detection and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data being exfiltrated or the commands being sent.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the tactics and techniques used by the attackers, including social engineering, obfuscation, and attempts to bypass security software.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the importance of encryption in protecting communication between the backdoor and the C&C server, especially considering the attackers' efforts to remain stealthy and evade detection.
   - **Step 3**: Although the report does not explicitly mention encryption, the use of encryption would align with the attackers' overall strategy of using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain control over compromised systems.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers would likely use an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server to protect their operations and data.

Final Answer: A
