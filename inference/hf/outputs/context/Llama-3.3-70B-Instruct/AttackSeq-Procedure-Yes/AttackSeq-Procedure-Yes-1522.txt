To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a strategic web compromise (SWC) where the Afghan Government's content delivery network (CDN) server was compromised.
   - The attackers modified a Javascript file (`jquery-1.4.2.min.js`) to load additional malicious code from a specific IP address (`176.58.101.24`).
   - The report mentions the use of IP address whitelisting by the attackers, suggesting targeted exploitation.
   - It does not explicitly mention the obfuscation method used for the malicious code.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after modifying the Javascript file, the attackers likely obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.
   - The question specifically mentions a technique (appending and encoding with Dean Edwards Packer) that could be used for obfuscation and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not directly mention the use of Dean Edwards Packer or the specific method of obfuscation.
   - However, the report does indicate selective exploitation and the use of IP address whitelisting, suggesting the attackers were sophisticated and likely employed evasion techniques.
   - The question's mention of appending malicious code to an existing file and using Dean Edwards Packer for encoding is a plausible method for defense evasion, given the context of targeted and sophisticated attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The CTI report outlines a sophisticated attack involving the modification of a Javascript file to deliver malicious code, indicating a level of complexity and intent to evade detection.
   - **Step 2**: The attackers' use of IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation suggests they were targeting specific victims and might have employed techniques to avoid detection, such as code obfuscation.
   - **Step 3**: While the report does not specify the obfuscation method, the technique mentioned in the question (appending to an existing file and encoding with Dean Edwards Packer) is a known method used for defense evasion.
   - **Step 4**: Given the sophistication of the attack and the attackers' intent to evade detection, it is plausible they would use such a method to obfuscate their malicious code.

**Final Answer: A**
