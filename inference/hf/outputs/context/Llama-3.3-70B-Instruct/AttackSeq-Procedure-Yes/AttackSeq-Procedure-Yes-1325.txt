To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infects systems through social engineering and document-based exploits.
     2. **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's to execute its payload.
     3. **Persistence**: It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
     4. **Credential Access**: CosmicDuke steals credentials from various software and Windows components.
     5. **Discovery**: The malware searches for specific file types on hard drives and network drives.
     6. **Command and Control**: It communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for data exfiltration.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during the discovery phase, CosmicDuke is likely to use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the information via FTP.
   - The key elements here are the discovery phase activities and the potential use of a clipboard stealer for data collection before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details CosmicDuke's capabilities, including its discovery phase where it searches for specific file types on hard drives and network drives. However, it does not explicitly mention searching removable drives or using a clipboard stealer as part of its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - The report focuses on file-based discovery and credential theft, followed by exfiltration via FTP. While clipboard stealers are a known method for collecting sensitive data, the report does not specify this behavior for CosmicDuke.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the main activities of CosmicDuke as described - initial access, execution, persistence, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Note that the discovery phase involves searching for specific file types, which aligns with the question's context about searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the use of a clipboard stealer is not mentioned in the report as part of CosmicDuke's TTPs.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no explicit mention of CosmicDuke using a clipboard stealer to collect data before exfiltration.
   
**Final Answer: B**
