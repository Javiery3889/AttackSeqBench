To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign by Iranian state-backed hackers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting information on targets.
     2. **Initial Access**: Utilizing phishing attacks through emails or social media, and compromising public figures' accounts.
     3. **Persistence**: Not changing passwords to remain undetected and monitor communications.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using images instead of text in phishing emails, hosting images on third-party services, and using hidden tracking images.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after evading Google's security systems by using images in phishing emails, it's likely that the attackers will verify victims' credentials in real-time and then prompt for the 2-step verification code.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     1. Evading security systems.
     2. Verifying credentials in real-time.
     3. Prompting for 2-step verification code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know the attackers used sophisticated methods to evade detection and gain access to accounts without raising suspicion, such as not changing passwords.
   - The use of images to bypass security systems and the ability to monitor communications in real-time suggest a high level of sophistication and interest in maintaining access without detection.
   - The question of verifying credentials in real-time and prompting for a 2-step verification code implies an attempt to fully compromise the account security features.
   - Given the attackers' goal of infiltrating accounts of individuals working on sanctions against Iran and their demonstrated capability in evading detection, it's plausible they would attempt to fully compromise these accounts, including bypassing 2-step verification.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have shown sophistication in evading detection and a clear interest in gaining and maintaining access to sensitive information.
   - The use of real-time monitoring and the evasion of security measures suggests they are capable of and interested in fully compromising accounts.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after evading Google's security systems, the attackers would attempt to verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code to fully compromise the account.

Final Answer: A
