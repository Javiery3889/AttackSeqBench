To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence as described in the CTI report and analyze the question in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The adversaries start by gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods such as scanning perimeter devices and social media data collection. This step is about understanding the target's network architecture and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Initial Access**: The report mentions that adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) on targeted networks after employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. This step involves gaining initial access to the network.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: After the installation of BE3, the malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server. This step is crucial for the adversaries to maintain control over the compromised systems and to deliver additional payloads.

Given this sequence, the question asks whether, after reconnaissance activities and the installation of malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution, it is likely that these implants will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.

**Analysis**:
- The CTI report explicitly states that after the installation of BlackEnergy 3, the malware attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests as part of its execution routine. This communication is essential for the adversaries to control the compromised systems, deliver additional malware, and conduct further malicious activities.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the steps outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is indeed likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. This communication is a critical component of the attack sequence, allowing the adversaries to maintain access, deliver additional payloads, and execute their attack plan.

**Final Answer: A**
