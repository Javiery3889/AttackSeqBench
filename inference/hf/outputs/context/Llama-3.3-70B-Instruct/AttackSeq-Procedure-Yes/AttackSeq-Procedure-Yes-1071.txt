To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign named Operation Earth Kitsune.
   - **Initial Access**: Watering hole tactics were used, exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to deliver malware.
   - **Execution**: Malware execution involved exploiting Chrome and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities, leading to the download of 'dropper.dll' and additional malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: A PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 for system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Malware checked for security software and aborted if detected.
   - **Discovery**: SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information and capture screenshots.
   - **Command and Control**: SLUB malware communicated with the Mattermost server for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information and capturing screenshots during the Discovery phase, the SLUB malware is likely to exfiltrate this data via the same Mattermost server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions that during the Discovery phase, the SLUB variant interacts with a Mattermost server to collect system information and capture screenshots, and then sends this data back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - This indicates that the Mattermost server is used not just for command and control but also for data exfiltration, as the report mentions that the collected information and screenshots are sent back to the server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of the Mattermost server in the campaign. The server is used for command and control and for collecting system information and screenshots.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the exfiltration of system information and screenshots aligns with the observed behavior of the SLUB malware. The report indicates that the malware sends collected data back to the Mattermost server.
   - **Step 3**: Conclude based on the analysis. Given that the SLUB malware uses the Mattermost server to send back collected system information and screenshots, it is reasonable to conclude that this server is also used for the exfiltration of such data.

Final Answer: A
