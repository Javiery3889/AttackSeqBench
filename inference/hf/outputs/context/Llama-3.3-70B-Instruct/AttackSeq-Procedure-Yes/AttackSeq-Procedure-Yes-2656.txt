To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - **Initial Access**: Involves phishing and watering hole attacks, with filenames related to current events.
   - **Execution**: Utilizes a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence**: Establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Features control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery**: Collects system information, including uptime, Windows version, and network details.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, encrypted with RC4.
   - **Exfiltration**: Performs data exfiltration via the same custom protocol, involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.
   - The key elements here are the collection of data and the method of exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the Korplug variant collects extensive system information and can communicate with C&C servers using a custom, encrypted TCP-based protocol.
   - The report specifically mentions that data exfiltration is performed via this custom protocol, which involves encrypted and compressed TCP messages.
   - Given that the malware is capable of collecting data and has a mechanism for encrypted communication with its C&C servers, it is reasonable to infer that it would use this mechanism for exfiltrating collected data, including data gathered from network shared drives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities of the Korplug malware as described in the CTI report, particularly its ability to collect system information and communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the method of data exfiltration used by the malware, which is via a custom, encrypted TCP-based protocol.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the question, which involves the collection of metadata and content from various sources, including local systems, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that, given the malware's capabilities and methods, it is likely to proceed with data exfiltration using its established encrypted communication protocol after gathering data.
   
Final Answer: A
