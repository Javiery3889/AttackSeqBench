To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Agrius' tactics starting with **Initial Access** through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Execution** involves deploying custom malware like the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include using obfuscated webshells and the backdoor's ability to update itself and delete traces.
   - **Lateral Movement** is facilitated by webshells tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts.
   - **Command and Control** involves the 'IPsec Helper' communicating with C2 servers over HTTP for various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the 'IPsec Helper' receives commands from C2 servers (specifically for sending recon information or downloading files), Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and the 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details Agrius' methods for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. It mentions the use of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for exfiltration and deploying additional malware.
   - The question implies a scenario where, after establishing command and control and potentially gathering reconnaissance or downloading files, Agrius might proceed with data destruction activities using specific malware ('Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD').
   - The report does not explicitly mention the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware but does indicate that Agrius uses custom malware and has the capability to deploy additional malware based on commands from C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the capabilities and tactics of Agrius as described in the CTI report, focusing on their use of custom malware and command and control structures.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question posits a scenario of data destruction following reconnaissance or file download, which aligns with potential post-exploitation activities.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate if the deployment of specific malware for data destruction ('Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD') is consistent with Agrius' modus operandi (MO) as described.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not explicitly mention these specific malware but does detail the use of custom malware for various purposes, including the potential for deploying additional malware, consider the plausibility based on the group's known tactics and capabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Agrius' demonstrated use of custom malware, ability to receive and execute commands from C2 servers, and the context of the question, it is plausible that they could deploy specific malware for data destruction as part of their operations. However, the report does not directly mention the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware, which introduces uncertainty. The question's context and the known tactics of Agrius suggest a potential for such actions, but without explicit mention, the answer leans towards the possibility based on the group's capabilities and the scenario described.

Final Answer: A
