To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents. These documents had embedded links that would send a GET request to the attacker's server when opened in Microsoft Word.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used an undocumented Word feature to evade detection. The documents appeared benign since they contained no macros, exploits, or active content.
   - **Others:** The report highlights an abuse of the INCLUDEPICTURE field in Microsoft Word, which can contain a link. The attackers used a Unicode link that Word ignored but followed a URL attached to a form within the document, leading to the attackers' server.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails after using a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the initial access vector was indeed through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links. 
   - The report also mentions that when these documents were opened in Microsoft Word, they would send a GET request to the attacker's server. This action can be interpreted as a method for the attackers to confirm that the target has opened the document and possibly to gather information about the target environment, such as the type of software installed, during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The technique described in the question aligns with the information provided in the CTI report. The attackers' use of the undocumented Word feature to evade detection and the sending of a GET request upon opening the document fits the scenario where the attackers would use such a method for reconnaissance purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the initial access vector and the method used by the attackers to evade detection and gather information.
   - **Step 2:** Analyze how the technique of sending a GET request to the attacker's server upon opening the document in Microsoft Word aligns with the reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - **Step 3:** Determine if the described sequence of events is plausible based on the CTI report.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the information in the CTI report and the details provided in the question, it is plausible that the Freakyshelly attackers would use the described method to gain initial access and inform themselves about the target environment.

Final Answer: A
