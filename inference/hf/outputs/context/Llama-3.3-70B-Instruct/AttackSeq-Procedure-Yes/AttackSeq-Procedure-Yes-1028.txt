To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gamaredon group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     - **Initial Access**: Spearphishing with malicious attachments.
     - **Execution**: Using scripting, rundll32, and CreateProcess for launching malicious DLLs and payloads.
     - **Persistence**: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, and inserting malicious macros.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscating files, modifying registry keys, and employing code signing.
     - **Discovery**: Automatically listing interesting files for future exfiltration.
     - **Lateral Movement**: Injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macro to send malicious emails.
     - **Command and Control**: Using HTTP and HTTPS.
     - **Exfiltration**: Automatically uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the sequence of TTPs after Gamaredon uses its Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement. It asks if the group is likely to deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities after this point.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that after gaining access and moving laterally, Gamaredon's activities include **Discovery**, where their backdoors list interesting files (like Office documents) for future exfiltration. This implies that scanning for sensitive documents is part of their post-compromise activities.
   - The use of Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement is a method to spread within an organization. Following this, the group's interest in collecting sensitive information is consistent with their overall objectives, as described in the "Others" section, which mentions gathering sensitive information and spreading further.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the relevant TTPs from the CTI report that align with the question's context, specifically focusing on post-lateral movement activities.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question essentially asks about the likelihood of the group engaging in document scanning for collection after they have moved laterally within a target organization.
   - **Step 3**: Recall from the report that Gamaredon's backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration, which directly supports the notion that they would scan for sensitive documents.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given the group's objectives and observed TTPs, it is reasonable to expect them to deploy scripts for scanning sensitive documents after lateral movement.

Final Answer: A
