To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** where the adversary gains SSH access and downloads malware using `wget`.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM), which hides processes.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are employed by the Derusbi malware and Turbo LKM to cloak and evade analysis.
   - **Discovery** involves gathering system information using the Derusbi malware.
   - **Command and Control** is established through network beacons and HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining SSH access and downloading malware, it's likely that the Turbo LKM will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and then deleted by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that the Turbo LKM is used for persistence and defense evasion, suggesting it is indeed loaded into the kernel to hide processes.
   - The question of whether it is dropped to disk, loaded, and then deleted to avoid detection involves understanding the tactics used for defense evasion. The report mentions that the LKM and Derusbi malware employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques, which could include fileless malware techniques or deleting files after loading them into memory to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary's use of SSH access and `wget` to fetch malware samples indicates a deliberate attempt to introduce malicious software into the target system.
   - The employment of the Turbo LKM for persistence and its ability to hide processes suggests sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - The Derusbi malware's role in gathering system information and its communication with command and control servers implies a need for stealthy operations.
   - Given the emphasis on evasion and stealth, it is plausible that the Turbo LKM would be handled in a way that minimizes its detectability on disk, such as being dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and then deleted.

**Final Answer: A**
