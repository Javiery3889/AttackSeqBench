To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The Desert Falcons conducted three campaigns targeting various high-profile victims across different regions.
   - They used homemade backdoors for full access and control, including functionalities like keylogs, password stealing, and more.
   - The report mentions the use of malware targeting Windows and Android devices and various infection vectors but does not explicitly detail the initial access methods.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after conducting campaigns with homemade backdoors for Command and Control (C2) activities, it is likely that the Desert Falcons used spear phishing emails and social engineering to achieve Initial Access.
   - The question focuses on the plausibility of using specific tactics (spear phishing and social engineering) for gaining initial access to targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the initial access methods used by the Desert Falcons but highlights the use of homemade backdoors and various infection vectors.
   - Given the context that the group targeted high-profile victims and used advanced malware with functionalities like keylogging and password stealing, it suggests a level of sophistication that could include social engineering and spear phishing for initial access.
   - Social engineering and spear phishing are common tactics used by sophisticated threat actors for initial access, as they can be highly effective against high-profile targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Desert Falcons' campaigns involved sophisticated malware and targeting of high-profile victims, indicating a level of operational sophistication.
   - **Step 2**: The use of homemade backdoors for C2 activities like keylogging and password stealing suggests the group has the capability to develop and deploy complex tools.
   - **Step 3**: Social engineering and spear phishing are typical methods used by sophisticated threat actors to gain initial access to targeted systems, especially when targeting high-profile victims.
   - **Step 4**: While the report does not explicitly mention these tactics, the group's sophistication and the nature of their targets make it plausible that they would use such methods for initial access.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication of the Desert Falcons' operations and the common use of social engineering and spear phishing in similar contexts, it is reasonable to conclude that they likely used these methods to achieve initial access.

Final Answer: A
