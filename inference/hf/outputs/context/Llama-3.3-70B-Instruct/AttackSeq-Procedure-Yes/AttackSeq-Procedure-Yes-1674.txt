To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used a malicious JavaScript-based framework called SocGholish, found on over 150 compromised websites, to initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript and subsequent downloading of PowerShell scripts for discovery.
   - **Execution, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, Command and Control, and Impact:** These tactics involved the use of Cobalt Strike, PowerShell, PsExec, and other tools for executing payloads, escalating privileges, evading defenses, accessing credentials, moving laterally, communicating with C&C servers, and finally encrypting files for ransom.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the SocGholish framework was used for initial compromise, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - However, the report mentions that after the initial compromise, the attackers used PowerShell scripts for discovery-related activities. It specifically does not mention the use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery. Instead, it talks about the use of Cobalt Strike and other tools for lateral movement and command execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' initial compromise method involved the SocGholish framework, which is consistent with the first part of the question.
   - The question's second part regarding the use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery is not directly supported by the CTI report. The report does mention the use of PowerShell for discovery but does not specify the use of PowerView or the Get-NetComputer command.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, it's plausible that the attackers could use various tools for discovery, but the specific sequence mentioned in the question (using SocGholish followed by Get-NetComputer from PowerView) is not directly described in the report.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the initial part of the question aligns with the report, the second part introduces a specific tool (Get-NetComputer from PowerView) not mentioned in the report. The report does indicate the use of PowerShell for discovery, which could potentially include PowerView, but it does not specify this tool or command.

**Final Answer: B**
