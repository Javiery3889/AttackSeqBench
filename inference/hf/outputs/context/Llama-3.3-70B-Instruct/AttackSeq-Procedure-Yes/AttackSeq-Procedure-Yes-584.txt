To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - The actors then used the webshell for **Execution** of various commands, including system and user discovery, and uploaded tools like a custom Mimikatz variant and Impacket's wmiexec and atexec tools.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques were employed using a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access** was gained using Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass the hash techniques.
   - **Discovery** involved running commands for initial system and network discovery.
   - **Command and Control** was maintained through the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after discovery, the actors likely used webshells for lateral movement by dumping credentials with a Mimikatz variant and using Impacket's atexec tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the initial access and execution phases, the actors focused on discovery and then used tools like Mimikatz and Impacket's tools for credential access and potentially for lateral movement.
   - The use of Mimikatz for dumping credentials and Impacket's atexec for executing commands on other systems aligns with techniques that could be used for lateral movement.
   - The presence of webshells, such as AntSword, and the use of tools like atexec, which can execute commands on remote systems, supports the possibility of using these tools for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the actors after the discovery phase, which seems to be moving laterally within the network.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the tools and techniques available to the actors, including webshells, Mimikatz, and Impacket's atexec.
   - **Step 3**: Consider how these tools can be used for lateral movement, such as using webshells as a pivot point, dumping credentials with Mimikatz, and executing commands on remote systems with atexec.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tools and techniques described, it is plausible that the actors used webshells for lateral movement by dumping credentials with a Mimikatz variant and using Impacket's atexec tool.

Final Answer: A
