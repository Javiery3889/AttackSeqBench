To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the reconnaissance efforts of cybercriminals targeting medical networks.
   - It mentions the use of tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure.
   - The report highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after identifying potential entry points, it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery.
   - The question essentially inquires about the likelihood of discovering vulnerable services and devices after the initial reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the use of masscan, Shodan, and Censys can lead to the identification of potential entry points, which often include discovering open ports and services.
   - The discovery of Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers without authentication, as mentioned in the report, suggests that such reconnaissance efforts can indeed reveal various services and devices on the network perimeter.
   - Given that the report explicitly mentions the discovery of specific types of services and devices, it is reasonable to infer that the reconnaissance phase would likely uncover other services, including outdated systems and medical devices, as part of network service discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The report details the use of specific tools for reconnaissance, which is aimed at identifying potential entry points into medical infrastructure.
   - **Step 2**: These tools are capable of discovering open ports and services, which can include a wide range of devices and systems connected to the network.
   - **Step 3**: The report provides examples of the types of services and devices that can be discovered through such reconnaissance, including those that are vulnerable due to lack of authentication.
   - **Step 4**: Given the capabilities of the tools mentioned and the examples provided in the report, it is logical to conclude that the reconnaissance efforts would likely discover various services on the medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the nature of the reconnaissance tools and techniques described, it is reasonable to expect that such efforts would lead to the discovery of various services and devices on the network.

Final Answer: A
