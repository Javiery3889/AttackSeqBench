To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack that starts with **Initial Access** via malicious emails containing a weaponized RTF document. This document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop a downloader (named svchost.exe).
   - The dropped executable has downloader functionality, implying it's designed to fetch additional malware components.
   - The report mentions the **Command and Control** aspect, stating that the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with its C&C servers.
   - It also notes that some modules rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration, suggesting a modular design where additional components, like the full RAT, might be downloaded post-initial infection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access, the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute, attempt to download the full RAT component from a specified IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001), and then establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence of actions the malware takes after the initial infection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the initial infection vector is a weaponized RTF document that drops a downloader.
   - The report does not explicitly state the IP address (213.136.87[.]122:10001) as a C&C server but mentions that the malware communicates with its C&C servers using a custom TCP protocol.
   - However, given the modular nature of the MSIL/Crimson malware and its need for a RAT component for full functionality (including data exfiltration), it's plausible that after initial access, the malware would attempt to download additional components, such as the full RAT, to establish a more robust presence on the victim's machine.
   - The specific IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001) are not mentioned in the provided CTI report, but the behavior of downloading additional components aligns with the described modular architecture of the malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware gains initial access through a weaponized RTF document.
   - **Step 2**: This document drops a downloader, which is designed to fetch additional malware components.
   - **Step 3**: Given the modular design of the MSIL/Crimson malware, it is reasonable to assume that the next step would involve downloading additional components necessary for its operation, such as the full RAT component.
   - **Step 4**: The question specifies a particular IP address and port for downloading the RAT component, which, while not explicitly mentioned in the report, fits the pattern of behavior expected from a modular malware seeking to establish a command and control channel.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the modular nature of the malware and the typical behavior of such threats, it is plausible that the malware would attempt to download the full RAT component before establishing command and control. Therefore, the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the expected behavior of the MSIL/Crimson malware post-initial access.

Final Answer: A
