To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT35, starting with **Initial Access** through a spear phishing email.
   - **Persistence** is established with C2 beaconing, indicating APT35 maintained a foothold.
   - **Discovery** involves Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automating the investigation after C2 detection.
   - **Lateral Movement** is noted as not occurring after C2 detection.
   - **Command and Control** activity is detected by Darktrace without signatures or threat intelligence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after APT35's initial access, Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst likely automated the investigation following **Command and Control** detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that after the C2 beaconing was detected (indicating **Command and Control** activity), Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device, automating the investigation process.
   - This directly aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the automation of the investigation process by Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst occurs after the detection of C2 activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Step 1: Identify the initial access method and subsequent actions by APT35, which includes C2 beaconing for persistence.
   - Step 2: Recognize the role of Darktrace's Cyber AI in detecting C2 activity and its response.
   - Step 3: Match the report's details with the question's scenario to determine the likelihood of Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automating the investigation after C2 detection.
   - Conclusion: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process following the detection of Command and Control activity, as this directly follows the sequence of events described.

Final Answer: A
