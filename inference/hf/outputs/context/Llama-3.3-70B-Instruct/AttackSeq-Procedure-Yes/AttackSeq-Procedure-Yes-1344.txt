To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where the initial access was gained by exploiting a known vulnerability in MS Exchange, CVE-2021-26855.
   - After initial access, the ShadowPad backdoor was downloaded and executed. Specifically, it mentions that the ShadowPad backdoor was launched using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application (OleView).
   - The attackers then used various tools, including those for stealing credentials (like Mimikatz) and for maintaining access.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via the MS Exchange vulnerability, it is likely that the attackers used DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor before stealing domain authentication credentials.
   - The key elements here are the exploitation of the MS Exchange vulnerability, the use of DLL hijacking to execute ShadowPad, and the act of stealing domain authentication credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know the attackers exploited the MS Exchange vulnerability for initial access.
   - We also know that the ShadowPad backdoor was executed using DLL hijacking.
   - Additionally, the report mentions the use of tools like Mimikatz for stealing credentials, which implies that stealing domain authentication credentials was part of the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers gained initial access by exploiting the MS Exchange vulnerability, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Step 2**: The report confirms that the ShadowPad backdoor was executed using DLL hijacking, which matches the second part of the question.
   - **Step 3**: The use of tools like Mimikatz indicates that the attackers were interested in stealing credentials, which would logically follow after establishing a foothold in the system, such as executing the ShadowPad backdoor.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is plausible that the sequence of events included exploiting the MS Exchange vulnerability, using DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor, and then stealing domain authentication credentials.

Final Answer: A
