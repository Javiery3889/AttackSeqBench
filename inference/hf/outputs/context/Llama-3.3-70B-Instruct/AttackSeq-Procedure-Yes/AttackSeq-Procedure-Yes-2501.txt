To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the RevengeHotels campaign targeting the hospitality sector.
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0199 to download and execute malware.
   - **Execution**: The downloaded malware includes RATs (Remote Access Trojans) like RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC. A module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data from web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. ProCC campaigns involve Delphi binaries with a backdoor that can collect data from the clipboard and printer spooler, capture screenshots, etc.
   - **Credential Access**: The attackers aim to capture credit card data and sell credentials for remote access to compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after capturing credentials, the malware is likely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know the attackers are interested in capturing credit card data.
   - The report specifically mentions that in the ProCC campaigns, the malware can collect data from the "printer spooler," which implies monitoring documents sent to the printer.
   - This capability aligns with the goal of capturing credit card data, as sensitive information might be printed and could be intercepted at the printer spooler level.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The RevengeHotels campaign's primary goal is to capture credit card data among other sensitive information.
   - The campaign uses various tactics, including monitoring web pages for credit card data (via ScreenBooking) and collecting data from the clipboard.
   - Specifically, the ProCC campaigns' ability to collect data from the printer spooler indicates a capability to monitor documents sent to the printer.
   - Given the attackers' interest in credit card data and the technical capabilities described, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed monitor documents sent to the printer as part of its data collection efforts.

Final Answer: A
