To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Targeted emails with malicious document files leveraging COVID-19 as a lure.
     2. **Execution**: The malicious document executes a VBScript (VBS) named 'PlayList.vbs' upon opening.
     3. **Persistence**: The VBS script registers a RUN key in the Windows registry for execution at every system startup.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The VBS script uses obfuscation and self-deletion after execution to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing defense evasion techniques (obfuscation and self-deletion), it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a specified C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the use of a VBS script for execution and persistence, as well as defense evasion techniques.
   - The question implies a potential **Command and Control (C2)** tactic, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided CTI report but is a common step after establishing persistence.
   - Given that the VBS script is designed for persistence and evades detection, it is plausible that its purpose includes communicating with a C&C server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - The specifics of the C&C server communication (e.g., the URL provided) are not detailed in the CTI report, but such communication is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of APT groups like Gamaredon.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and tactics used by the Gamaredon APT group.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the question's context about the VBS script's potential communication with a C&C server.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that while the CTI report does not explicitly mention C&C communication, the use of persistence and defense evasion techniques suggests the script is designed for ongoing malicious activity, which could include C2 communication.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the plausibility of the VBS script communicating with a C&C server given its design for persistence and evasion.

Given the information and the typical behaviors of APT groups, it is reasonable to conclude that the VBS script could indeed communicate with a C&C server as part of its operation, even though the specific details of this communication are not provided in the CTI report.

Final Answer: A
