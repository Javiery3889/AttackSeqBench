To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through a compromised website, leading to the download of malicious JavaScript files and eventually malware.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the malware (gpsvc.exe) being executed, which is packed with 'Enigma Protector' and can drop/install DLLs.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include the use of a commercial packer and mimicking normal system queries.
   - **Command and Control** involves communication with C&C servers using a beacon that resembles a Firefox browser on Windows.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, the malware will likely attempt communication with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the malware communicates with the C&C using a beacon with the User-Agent resembling a Firefox browser on Windows.
   - The question's scenario (executing system information discovery commands and returning results to the C&C) is consistent with the behaviors described in the report, particularly under **Defense Evasion** and **Command and Control**.
   - Given that the malware is designed to communicate with the C&C server and has been observed doing so in a manner that mimics a Firefox browser on Windows, it is reasonable to conclude that after executing system information discovery commands, the malware would continue to use this method for communication as part of its command and control activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's behavior, as described, includes executing system information gathering commands and communicating with the C&C server.
   - The method of communication with the C&C server involves mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows.
   - The question's scenario fits within the described behaviors of the malware.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the malware would continue to use its established method of communication for command and control activities after executing system information discovery commands.

Final Answer: A
