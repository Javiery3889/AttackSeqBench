To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence of the Trickbot banking trojan campaign, which includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spam emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document that drops a JavaScript file to download Trickbot.
     2. **Execution**: The JavaScript file executes, displaying a fake error while running in the background and creating a copy of itself for persistence.
     3. **Persistence**: Trickbot creates a copy of itself in the Startup folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Trickbot evades detection by checking for virtual environments and analysis-related processes.
     5. **Credential Access**: Steals credentials and information from various applications.
     6. **Collection**: Uses modules for PoS extraction and intercepts web traffic.
     7. **Command and Control**: Connects to a URL to download and execute its payload.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after connecting to its Command and Control server, Trickbot is likely to proceed to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves post-exploitation activities, specifically actions taken after the malware has established command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention Trickbot deleting files with specific extensions in removable and network drives as part of its tactics.
   - The report focuses on Trickbot's capabilities for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, collection, and command and control, but it does not detail file deletion as a tactic.
   - Given the emphasis on stealing credentials, intercepting web traffic, and modifying transactions, Trickbot's primary goals appear to be financial gain through theft and fraud rather than through destructive actions like file deletion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goals and tactics of Trickbot as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if file deletion is a tactic mentioned or implied in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of Trickbot engaging in file deletion based on its primary goals and the tactics described.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the report does not mention file deletion and Trickbot's focus is on financial gain through stealthy means, it is less likely that deleting files with specific extensions is a primary tactic.

Final Answer: B
