To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment exploiting CVE-2021-40444.
     2. **Execution**: Exploiting CVE-2021-40444 for client execution and using PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager).
     3. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through hijacked COM objects and creating a local account.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Using reflective code loading.
     5. **Command and Control**: Creating multiple stages for obfuscation, using an existing legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive), and employing encryption for command and control traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initiating the attack, it's likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure (like domains) for command and control servers during resource development.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves initial access and execution, focusing on the exploitation of a vulnerability and the use of existing services for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that for command and control, the adversaries used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive) rather than setting up their own infrastructure like domains.
   - This suggests that the attackers relied on existing services to blend in and avoid detection, rather than acquiring and setting up their own command and control infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method used for command and control in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if this method involves acquiring new infrastructure or using existing services.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the implications of using existing services versus acquiring new infrastructure for command and control.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the attackers used an existing legitimate service (Microsoft OneDrive) for command and control, it suggests they did not acquire new infrastructure like domains for this purpose. This approach helps in evasion and blending in with normal traffic.

Final Answer: B
