To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's initial access methods, including the use of back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - It mentions a specific instance where a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - The malware is designed for espionage, with capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, including configuring specific domain and IP address combinations for C&C servers, using privacy services, and communicating over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The malware is designed to communicate externally at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after infecting a target with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit, Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
   - The question essentially inquires about the behavior of Longhorn's malware post-infection, specifically regarding evasion techniques and the execution of its espionage capabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, it's clear that Longhorn's operations are characterized by a high degree of operational security.
   - The report highlights the use of custom cryptographic protocols for communication, randomization of communication intervals, and the use of legitimate services to hide their identity, all of which are tactics to avoid detection.
   - Given that the malware is designed for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities, and considering the emphasis on operational security, it is reasonable to infer that Longhorn's tools would indeed follow guidelines or tactics to avoid detection.
   - The fact that the malware is built with operational security measures to remain undetected supports the notion that it would attempt to avoid detection before and during the execution of its espionage-focused capabilities, such as system fingerprinting and discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify Longhorn's initial infection methods and malware capabilities.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the emphasis on operational security in Longhorn's operations.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize the malware's design for espionage with capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - **Step 4**: Infer the likelihood of Longhorn's tools following tactics to avoid detection based on the provided information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the emphasis on operational security, the design of the malware for espionage, and the tactics used to avoid detection, it is likely that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

Final Answer: A
