To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to download an HTA file from webserv-redir.net.
     2. **Execution**: The HTA file checks for antivirus software using WMI and, if not detected, executes the FinalBot backdoor (renamed to Srvstr.exe).
     3. **Persistence**: Establishment of persistence through a Run key in the registry.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Avoidance of PowerShell and use of DLL sideloading.
     5. **Discovery**: Use of WMI to discover installed antivirus products.
   - The report mentions that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after a series of actions (exploiting CVE-2017-11882, using WMI to check for antivirus software, executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading), it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server after being downloaded from webserv-redir.net.
   - The actions described in the question (exploiting CVE-2017-11882, checking for antivirus software, executing the backdoor with DLL sideloading) are all part of the attack sequence described in the CTI report.
   - The question essentially asks if the communication with the C2 server, which is part of the initial access tactic, would occur after these specific actions, which are part of the execution and defense evasion tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server.
   - The actions described in the question are consistent with the tactics outlined in the CTI report.
   - Given that the HTA file's communication with the C2 server is mentioned as part of its behavior after initial access, and considering the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the HTA file would indeed communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control as part of its operation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report aligns with the option that affirms this communication.

Final Answer: A
