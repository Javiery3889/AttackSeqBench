To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) on the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) website.
   - The exploit deployed a malware payload (Rdws.exe), which used a DLL sideloading technique to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) via the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe).
   - The attackers used defense evasion techniques, including sideloading, to deploy the malware and connect back to their infrastructure.
   - The report mentions that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, which are part of the attackers' infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion, it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication.
   - The question focuses on the command and control (C2) communication phase of the attack, specifically whether the malware would connect back to a specified domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the domain "pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org" as part of the attackers' infrastructure or the exploit domain.
   - However, it does state that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, which were part of the attackers' infrastructure.
   - Given that the report details the use of sideloading for evasion and mentions connection to the attackers' infrastructure for C2 communication, it's plausible that the malware would connect back to a domain controlled by the attackers for command and control purposes.
   - The question's specificity about the domain "pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org" is not directly addressed in the report, but the behavior of connecting back to an exploit domain or infrastructure-controlled domains is consistent with the tactics described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report describes an attack where malware is deployed using sideloading techniques and connects back to the attackers' infrastructure for C2 communication.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the malware connecting back to a specific domain during C2 communication after using sideloading for evasion.
   - While the specific domain "pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org" is not mentioned in the report, the behavior of connecting back to an exploit domain or the attackers' infrastructure is consistent with the described tactics.
   - Therefore, based on the tactics and techniques described in the CTI report, it is plausible that the malware would connect back to a domain controlled by the attackers for command and control purposes, even though the specific domain in question is not mentioned in the report.

Final Answer: A
