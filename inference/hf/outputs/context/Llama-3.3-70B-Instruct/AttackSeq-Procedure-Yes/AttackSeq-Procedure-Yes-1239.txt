To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the initial access method of WinDealer malware, which leverages the automatic update mechanism of certain legitimate applications.
   - It mentions the execution of WinDealer, including its modular design, capabilities such as file manipulation and network discovery, and its ability to download/upload files.
   - Persistence is achieved through the registry's RUN key for configuration updates.
   - The report also touches on the discovery aspect, noting the malware's focus on Chinese-speaking targets and popular applications in Asia.
   - **Key Points for Analysis**: Initial access via legitimate application updates, execution involves decoding a DLL for various capabilities, persistence via registry, and a focus on Chinese targets.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of WinDealer using specific ports (UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556) for Command and Control (C2) communication after initial access and maintaining persistence.
   - **Key Points for Analysis**: The question is focused on the communication methods used by WinDealer for C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for C2 communication.
   - However, it does describe WinDealer's capabilities, including arbitrary file download/upload and command execution, which imply the need for C2 communication.
   - The report does not specify the protocols or ports used for this communication, making it necessary to infer based on common practices and the information given.
   - Given that the question asks for a likelihood based on the provided information, we must consider whether the use of specific ports for C2 communication is consistent with the malware's described capabilities and behaviors.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the initial access and persistence methods of WinDealer, which involve exploiting legitimate application updates and using the registry for persistence.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the malware's need for C2 communication to fulfill its capabilities, such as downloading/uploading files and executing commands.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the report does not specify the exact ports used for C2 communication.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the common practices of malware using specific ports for C2 and whether the use of UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 would be unusual or expected based on the malware's other behaviors.
   - **Conclusion**: Without explicit information on the ports used by WinDealer for C2 communication in the CTI report, and considering the question's request for a likelihood assessment, the most appropriate answer would be based on the general understanding of malware communication tactics and the specifics of WinDealer's behaviors as described.

Given the information provided and the steps followed, the final answer would be based on the understanding that the CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of these specific ports, and thus, we cannot confirm their use directly from the report.

**Final Answer: B**
