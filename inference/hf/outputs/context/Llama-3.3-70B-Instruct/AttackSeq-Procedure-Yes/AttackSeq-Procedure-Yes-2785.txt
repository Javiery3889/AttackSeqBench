To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses Operation Pawn Storm and the discovery of iOS malware, part of the advanced malware family similar to SEDNIT for Windows.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The XAgent app is fully functional, hides its icon on iOS 7, runs in the background, and can restart immediately if terminated. It collects various information: text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status.
   - **Discovery**: The app's capabilities are focused on data collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting specific data, the XAgent app will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests and communicate with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves data collection followed by potential data exfiltration and communication with a command and control (C&C) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the malware's ability to collect extensive data from compromised iOS devices but does not explicitly mention how the data is exfiltrated or the specifics of the communication with the C&C server.
   - However, given the nature of the malware and its capabilities, it is reasonable to infer that the collected data would need to be exfiltrated to be of use to the attackers. Common methods for data exfiltration include HTTP requests due to their ubiquity and the ease with which they can blend in with normal network traffic.
   - The use of a Base64 encoded token for identification with the C&C server is a plausible method for the malware to communicate and authenticate with its command and control infrastructure, as Base64 encoding is often used for transferring binary data over text-based protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware collects sensitive data from iOS devices, which implies a need for exfiltration to a server controlled by the attackers.
   - **Step 2**: HTTP requests are a common method for exfiltrating data due to their commonality and the difficulty in distinguishing them from legitimate traffic without deep packet inspection.
   - **Step 3**: The use of a Base64 encoded token for identification is a plausible method for the malware to authenticate with its C&C server, given the encoding's widespread use in similar contexts.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the malware's capabilities and the common TTPs used by similar malware, it is reasonable to conclude that the XAgent app would exfiltrate collected data via HTTP requests and use a Base64 encoded token for C&C server communication.

Final Answer: A
