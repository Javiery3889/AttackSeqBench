To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions that Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications.
   - It also mentions that Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns to potentially evade detection.
   - The updated Aumlib malware was downloaded from specific URLs, indicating command and control activities.
   - The new Ixeshe sample contains encoded data, suggesting methods for tracking attacks and possibly evading detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after deploying updated malware, APT12 will attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe before connecting to specific URLs during command and control.
   - The question focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to defense evasion and command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications, which could include encoding the HTTP POST body as a method of defense evasion.
   - The report also mentions Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns, which could involve employing a different Base64 encoding pattern for its traffic to evade detection.
   - The actions described in the question (encoding HTTP POST body for Aumlib and using a different Base64 encoding for Ixeshe) align with the evolving TTPs of APT12 as described in the report, especially in the context of evading detection and improving their command and control capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the CTI report related to the question, which are the updates to Aumlib and Ixeshe malware, including encoding and new network traffic patterns.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the question's focus on defense evasion techniques and command and control.
   - **Step 3**: Match the report's details with the question's specifics, noting that the report supports the idea that APT12 is evolving its TTPs to include more sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the actions described in the question are consistent with the evolving tactics of APT12 as outlined in the CTI report.

Final Answer: A
