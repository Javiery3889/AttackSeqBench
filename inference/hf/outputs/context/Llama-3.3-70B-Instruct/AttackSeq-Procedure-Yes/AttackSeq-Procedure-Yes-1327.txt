To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's infection process, starting with Initial Access through social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - Execution involves the use of a loader similar to MiniDuke's, with various compilation dates.
   - Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks and a Windows service.
   - Credential Access involves stealing credentials from various software and Windows components.
   - Discovery includes searching for specific file patterns and non-English filenames.
   - Collection involves using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, as well as searching removable drives.
   - Command and Control (C2) communications are via HTTP GET requests, with FTP and WebDav servers used for exfiltrating data and updating the malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting information, CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials during the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that during the Collection phase, CosmicDuke collects information using various methods.
   - It also states that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data, with the configuration (including server IPs, URLs, and credentials) embedded in the malware.
   - This implies that after collecting information, CosmicDuke has the capability and the intent to exfiltrate the data to remote servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the Collection methods used by CosmicDuke, which include a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the methods used by CosmicDuke for Command and Control and data exfiltration, which include HTTP GET requests, FTP, and WebDav servers.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the malware has embedded configuration for server communication, including credentials, which facilitates automated exfiltration.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given the capabilities and behaviors described, CosmicDuke is designed to collect and then exfiltrate data, aligning with the question's scenario.

Final Answer: A
