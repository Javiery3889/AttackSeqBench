To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents that employed the remote template technique to gain initial access. This technique allows the attackers to retrieve the next stage of the malware from their server when the document is opened.

2. **Persistence**: After initial access, the attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update'. This task was set up to run a specific function from a DLL, which helped maintain the foothold on the system.

3. **Exploitation and Infection Chain**: The report mentions the use of the RoyalRoad RTF exploit building kit, which is known for exploiting vulnerabilities such as those in Microsoft Equation Editor. However, the specific sequence of exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using RoyalRoad before creating the 'Windows Update' task for persistence is not directly stated in the report.

Given the information:

- The attackers used spear-phishing with malicious DOCX documents for initial access.
- The report mentions the use of RoyalRoad, which is associated with RTF exploits, but the initial access vector described is DOCX, not RTF.
- The creation of a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' for persistence is a later step in the attack sequence.

Considering these points, the question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access through malicious DOCX documents, the attackers would exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities (typically associated with RTF files and the RoyalRoad tool) before creating the 'Windows Update' task for persistence.

The report does indicate a multi-stage infection chain and the use of various techniques for exploitation and evasion, but it specifically describes the initial access vector as malicious DOCX documents using the remote template technique, not the exploitation of Equation Editor vulnerabilities via RoyalRoad.

However, given the context that the attackers are sophisticated, using various tools and techniques, and the mention of RoyalRoad (which is associated with exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities), it's plausible that the attackers could use such an exploit in their toolkit, potentially as part of their infection chain. But the direct sequence from the DOCX initial access to exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities before establishing persistence is not explicitly outlined in the report.

Given the information and focusing on the specific sequence of events asked about in the question, the most direct answer based on the provided details would lean towards the possibility of such actions being part of the attackers' toolkit and methods, but the report does not explicitly confirm this exact sequence of events following the initial DOCX-based access.

Therefore, considering the attackers' sophistication and the tools mentioned, but also the specific details provided about the initial access vector and the establishment of persistence:
