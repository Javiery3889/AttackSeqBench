To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described:

1. **Initial Access**: The report mentions the exploitation of vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) as the initial access vector but does not detail the immediate actions following exploitation. However, it does describe the system configuration file (in.sys) dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which then deletes itself.

2. **Execution**: The backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) drops several files, including a normal sidebar.exe, a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file. It uses the BITSadmin command-line tool to launch sidebar.exe, which is then subjected to DLL hijacking by the malicious loader, leading to the injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

Given this sequence:
- The system configuration file drops UserInstall.exe.
- UserInstall.exe drops the malicious loader (wab32res.dll) among other files.
- The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) is used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe through DLL hijacking of sidebar.exe.

**Analysis of the Question**:
The question asks if it is likely that the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) before the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) was used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. Based on the sequence of events described in the CTI report:
- The backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is dropped first.
- This installer then drops the malicious loader (wab32res.dll).
- The malicious loader is subsequently used in the DLL hijacking process to inject a backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Conclusion**:
Given the sequence of events, it is indeed likely that the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) before the malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) was used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. This aligns with the described sequence of the attack where UserInstall.exe is dropped first and is responsible for dropping the malicious loader, which is then used in the attack sequence.
