To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets. A specific instance involved a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration. It employs operational security measures to remain undetected.
   - **Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration:** These phases involve extensive remote control capabilities, customized plugins, and secure communication protocols to protect the malware's activities from detection.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after gaining initial access, Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection (as outlined in the Vault 7 documents) before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report highlights Longhorn's use of operational security measures to remain undetected. This includes configuring specific domain and IP address combinations per target for C&C servers, using privacy services, and communicating over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the Vault 7 documents but emphasizes Longhorn's sophisticated operational security and evasion techniques.
   - Given Longhorn's focus on espionage and their demonstrated use of advanced evasion techniques, it is reasonable to infer that they would employ tactics to avoid detection, consistent with the principles that might be outlined in documents like those from Vault 7, which are known for detailing sophisticated cyber espionage tools and techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify Longhorn's primary goals and methods. They are focused on espionage, using advanced malware for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2:** Consider Longhorn's operational security measures. They use customized C&C servers, privacy services, and encrypted communication protocols to avoid detection.
   - **Step 3:** Relate Longhorn's methods to the question about following guidelines to avoid detection. Given their sophisticated evasion techniques and focus on remaining undetected, it is plausible they would adhere to guidelines or best practices for evasion, such as those that might be found in the Vault 7 documents.
   - **Step 4:** Conclude based on the analysis. Longhorn's operational security focus and use of advanced evasion techniques suggest they would likely follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting.

**Final Answer: A**
