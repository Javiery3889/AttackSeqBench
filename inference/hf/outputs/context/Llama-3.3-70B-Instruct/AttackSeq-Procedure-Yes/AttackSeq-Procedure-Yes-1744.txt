To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by TG1021, a threat actor, in a cyber attack. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Identifying vulnerabilities.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
     3. **Execution**: Executing memory-resident malware.
     4. **Persistence**: Using web shells and a custom malware framework for persistence while removing disk-resident tools.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Employing custom tools like PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation.
     6. **Credential Access**: Modifying login webpages to capture credentials.
     7. **Discovery**: Using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance without leaving disk traces.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Moving laterally using compromised credentials and exploits.
     9. **Command and Control**: Establishing control through an IIS request handling process hook.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 likely demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.
   - The key sequence of TTPs in question involves privilege escalation followed by potential defense evasion tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, it's clear that after gaining initial access and executing malware, TG1021 focused on maintaining stealth. This is evident from their use of memory-resident malware and the removal of disk-resident tools after use.
   - The use of a custom version of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) for privilege escalation is a specific instance of TG1021's tactics. Following this, the report mentions that the threat actor "actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them, effectively giving up on persistency in exchange for stealth."
   - This behavior indicates a deliberate effort to avoid detection, aligning with defense evasion strategies. The removal of tools and the preference for memory-resident operations suggest that TG1021 prioritized stealth over persistence, at least in terms of leaving behind evidence on disk.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the sequence of TTPs related to the question, which involves privilege escalation and potential defense evasion.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report explicitly mentions the removal of disk-resident tools as a tactic used by TG1021 to maintain stealth.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that this behavior is consistent with a strategy to avoid detection, which is a key aspect of defense evasion.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the emphasis on stealth and evasion tactics by TG1021, it is reasonable to conclude that after employing a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 did demonstrate significant efforts to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A
