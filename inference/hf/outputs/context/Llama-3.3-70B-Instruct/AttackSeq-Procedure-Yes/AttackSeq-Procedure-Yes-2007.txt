To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack sequence ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, starting from Reconnaissance to Impact.
   - Key steps include:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information on potential targets.
     - **Initial Access**: Delivering a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) through a phishing campaign, specifically using BlackEnergy 3.
     - **Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server.
     - The report mentions that after the delivery of the BlackEnergy 3 malware through phishing, the malware establishes a connection to an external server via HTTP requests as part of its execution routine.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT through a phishing campaign, it is likely that the adversaries will establish a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities.
   - The question focuses on the establishment of a C2 connection as a follow-up action to the initial access gained by delivering the RAT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we understand that the delivery of the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is followed by the establishment of a C2 connection. This connection is crucial for the adversaries to control the compromised systems, deliver additional malware, and conduct further malicious activities.
   - The report specifically mentions that after the installation of the malicious files (which includes the execution of malicious VBA scripts), the malware implant attempts to communicate with an external server, establishing a C2 connection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The adversaries conduct a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.
   - **Step 2**: The RAT is installed on the target systems after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros, which executes the malicious VBA script.
   - **Step 3**: The malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, which then attempts to establish a connection to an external server.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is logical to conclude that after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, the adversaries would indeed establish a C2 connection through the execution of the malicious VBA script. This connection is essential for enabling further malicious activities, such as internal network reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and the delivery of additional malware.

Final Answer: A
