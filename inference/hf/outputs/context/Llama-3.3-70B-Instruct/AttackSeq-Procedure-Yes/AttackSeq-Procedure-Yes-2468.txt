To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: An email with a malicious PDF attachment was sent and opened, initiating the attack.
     2. **Execution**: The attachment executed scripts and batch files, leading to the decryption of files and the extraction of contents.
     3. **Persistence**: Modifications were made to the Windows registry to ensure continuous operation, and legitimate applications were used to collect credentials.
     4. **Credential Access**: Credentials were collected from local mail clients and Internet browsers using legitimate applications.
     5. **Collection**: Credentials were collected recurrently.
     6. **Command and Control**: An FTP command was used to upload stolen credentials.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an external FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the attack started with a benign-appearing PDF attachment that evaded security filters and then used legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that the attack began with an email containing a PDF attachment that "passed through all security filters" and was "actually an executable file disguised as a document." This matches the first part of the question.
   - The report further details how the attack used legitimate applications and scripts (like batch files and VB scripts) for its operations, which aligns with the second part of the question about evading detection by using legitimate tools and scripts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attack initiated with a PDF attachment that was disguised as a benign document but was actually an executable file. This matches the description in the question.
   - **Step 2**: The attack utilized legitimate tools and scripts for its operations, which helped in evading detection. This is consistent with the tactics described in the CTI report.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the attack started with a PDF attachment that appeared benign, passed through security filters, and then used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection and carry out its operations.

Final Answer: A
