To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where an Excel file with a malicious macro is sent via email.
   - When the macro is enabled, it displays a fake invoice and silently installs the ISMAgent Trojan.
   - The Trojan is written to a file, and a VBScript is created to execute it.
   - A scheduled task is set for persistence.
   - The attack involves defense evasion techniques, such as using a decoy document.
   - The ISMAgent Trojan communicates with its C2 server using HTTP requests and DNS tunneling.
   - The report mentions the OilRig campaign and its potential link to the Greenbug threat group.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the malicious Excel file contained a macro designed to display a fake invoice while installing ISMAgent after phishing emails were sent by actors associated with the OilRig campaign.
   - The question essentially summarizes the initial steps of the attack described in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that the Excel file contained a malicious macro that displayed a fake invoice while silently running malicious code to install the ISMAgent payload.
   - The report also mentions the OilRig campaign in the context of the attack, indicating that the actors associated with this campaign are involved in sending phishing emails with malicious attachments like the described Excel file.
   - Therefore, the details in the question align with the information provided in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack vector described in the CTI report, which involves a malicious Excel file with a macro.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the macro's behavior of displaying a fake invoice while installing malware.
   - **Step 3**: Note the involvement of the OilRig campaign in the attack.
   - **Step 4**: Compare these details with the question, which asks about the likelihood of this specific scenario.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the direct correlation between the CTI report's details and the question's scenario, it is highly likely that the malicious Excel file was designed to display a fake invoice while installing ISMAgent after phishing emails were sent by actors associated with the OilRig campaign.

Final Answer: A
