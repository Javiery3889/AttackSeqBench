To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association'. These emails contain a malicious URL leading to a fake Adobe Flash Player update page, which ultimately results in the installation of the 'FriarFox' malicious Firefox browser extension.
   - After installation, the FriarFox extension is used for **Defense Evasion**, allowing threat actors to access the user's Gmail account and Firefox browser data. It contacts a command and control server to retrieve the PHP and JS-based payload Scanbox.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via phishing emails and delivering the FriarFox malicious browser extension, it is likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves using the malicious browser extension to establish communication with a command and control server for further payload delivery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the FriarFox browser extension, once installed, contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload. This directly aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The report provides context that TA413, the threat actor, has used the Scanbox framework since at least June 2020, indicating a pattern of behavior that supports the likelihood of using the FriarFox extension for this purpose.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method described in the CTI report, which is through phishing emails leading to the installation of the FriarFox malicious browser extension.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the purpose and capabilities of the FriarFox extension as described, which includes contacting a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the question in light of the information provided in the CTI report, noting that the report directly supports the sequence of events outlined in the question.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the threat actors will use the FriarFox extension to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload, as this aligns with the described capabilities and past behaviors of the threat actor.

Final Answer: A
