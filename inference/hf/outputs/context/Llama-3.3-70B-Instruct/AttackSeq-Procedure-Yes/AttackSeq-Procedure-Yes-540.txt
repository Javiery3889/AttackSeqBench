To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack involving a variant of the Poison Ivy (PIVY) Remote Access Trojan (RAT), specifically a new variant called SPIVY.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: SPIVY uses DLL sideloading and drops several files, including a decoy document, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll, and the PIVY shellcode file.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes its malicious actions by copying rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and running it with the path to the DLL.
     3. **Persistence**: SPIVY installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection.
   - The report mentions that the C2s (Command & Control servers) have their hostnames modified with a null-byte followed by a changing string, but it does not directly state the method of communication with these C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after evading defenses, the PIVY variant is likely to communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where the malware first evades defenses and then potentially communicates with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the evasion techniques used by the PIVY variant, including DLL sideloading and configuration modification.
   - The question specifically asks about communication with C2 servers after evasion, which aligns with the typical behavior of malware post-infection, where establishing C2 communication is crucial for receiving further instructions or exfiltrating data.
   - Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) are commonly used for C2 communication due to their ubiquity and the ease with which they can blend in with normal network traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection, as described in the report.
   - **Step 2**: After evading detection, the next logical step for the malware would be to establish communication with its C2 servers to receive commands or send stolen data.
   - **Step 3**: Given that the report mentions modified C2 hostnames and the question specifies communication with C2 servers like webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com, it's reasonable to infer that such communication would occur over application layer protocols, which are commonly used for C2 communication due to their ability to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of malware and the specifics of the PIVY variant's evasion techniques and C2 server communication, it is likely that the malware would use application layer protocols for this purpose.

Final Answer: A
