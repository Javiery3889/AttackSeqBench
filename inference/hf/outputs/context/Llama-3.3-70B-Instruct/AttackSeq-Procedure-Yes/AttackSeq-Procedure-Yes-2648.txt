To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the initial access tactics of the Dridex malware, which involves spreading through spambots sending malicious documents attached to emails. When opened, these documents execute macros that download and execute the Dridex payload.
   - The execution phase involves a loader and a payload. The loader uses anti-debug techniques like the OutputDebugStringW function to complicate analysis, and the payload is heavily obfuscated with no direct function calls and uses RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.
   - Defense evasion tactics include anti-debug techniques and obfuscation. The loader generates a large number of debug messages, and the payload uses hash values for call resolutions and RC4 encryption for strings.
   - The "Others" section provides additional context about the malware's background, evolution, targets, and indicators but does not directly relate to the technical operation of the malware post-defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing defense evasion techniques, the Dridex malware is likely to send encrypted POST requests containing specific data (computer name and botnet ID) to connect to proxy servers for command and control.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where the malware, after evading detection, communicates with its command and control (C2) infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the initial infection vector, execution, and defense evasion techniques but does not explicitly mention the communication with C2 servers or the specifics of how the malware exfiltrates data or receives commands.
   - However, it is a common TTP for malware, after establishing a foothold and evading detection, to communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or both. This communication often involves sending encrypted data to avoid detection.
   - Given the sophistication of Dridex, including its use of anti-debug techniques and obfuscation, it is plausible that it would also employ secure communication methods with its C2 infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the initial access and execution methods of Dridex, which involve sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the importance of command and control communication for malware like Dridex to operate effectively.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the typical behaviors of malware post-infection, including data exfiltration and command reception, which often involve encrypted communication to proxy servers.
   - **Step 4**: Given the context and the common TTPs of similar malware, infer the likely behavior of Dridex in this scenario.

Final Answer: A
