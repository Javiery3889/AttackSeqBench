To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes APT28's tactics starting with **Initial Access** through spear-phishing campaigns, using malicious URLs or exploit documents to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics include leveraging vulnerabilities and using legitimate tools for lateral movement.
   - **Credential Access** involves harvesting credentials through spear-phishing, fake login pages, or malicious applications.
   - **Lateral Movement** is achieved through strategic web compromises and exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via spear-phishing, APT28 would execute exploit documents to install malware before using specific tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE) during their operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that APT28 uses spear-phishing to deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto users' systems. This aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - The report mentions exploiting vulnerabilities to install malware, which is consistent with the execution of exploit documents to install malware like GAMEFISH.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the tools CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE, it does indicate that APT28 uses legitimate tools for lateral movement and has a traditional toolset, suggesting they do use various tools during their operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT28 uses spear-phishing to gain initial access, which matches the beginning of the question.
   - **Step 2**: The group delivers exploit documents to deploy malware, which is a method to execute documents and install malware like GAMEFISH.
   - **Step 3**: Although the specific tools mentioned in the question (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE) are not detailed in the report, the report's description of APT28's tactics suggests they use various tools for different phases of their operations, including after gaining access and installing malware.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the tactics described, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, APT28 would execute exploit documents to install malware before leveraging other tools during their operations.

Final Answer: A
