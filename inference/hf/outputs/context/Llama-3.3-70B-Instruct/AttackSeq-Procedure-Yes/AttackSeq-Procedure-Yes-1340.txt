To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Initial Access**: An Adobe Flash zero-day exploit is delivered through a Microsoft Office document.
     2. **Execution**: The exploit allows for arbitrary read/write operations in memory, enabling the execution of a second stage shellcode.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: The FinSpy malware uses anti-analysis techniques.
     4. **Exfiltration**: The second stage shellcode downloads the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document.
   - The key detail here is that after gaining execution capabilities, the second stage shellcode is involved in downloading the final payload.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the initial exploit gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities to execute a second stage shellcode, it is likely that this shellcode will then download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the execution of a second stage shellcode, followed by the potential download of the final payload and communication with Command and Control (C2) servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that the second stage shellcode indeed downloads the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document. This matches part of what the question is asking.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the establishment of communication with C2 servers for further control after the download of the final payload. However, it is a common practice in malware operations for the final payload to communicate with C2 servers for receiving further instructions, exfiltrating data, or uploading additional malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report confirms that the second stage shellcode downloads the final payload (FinSpy), which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the second stage shellcode establishes communication with C2 servers, the context of downloading a final payload like FinSpy typically implies that such communication would occur for the malware to be effective.
   - Given the information provided and the common practices of malware operations, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the second stage shellcode would download the final payload and likely establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

Final Answer: A
