To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in (.ppa) that executes a VBA macro.
   - **Execution:** The macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper, which then downloads and executes the RevengeRAT payload.
   - **Persistence:** A scheduled task is created to run 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours, ensuring the malware's persistence.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after establishing persistence, RevengeRAT is likely to communicate with its command and control (C2) servers and send victim machine information to specific domains, given the attacker's infrastructure is located in Canada and Brazil.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report details the initial infection vector, execution of the malware, and how persistence is achieved. It mentions the use of RevengeRAT but does not explicitly state its communication methods or the specific C2 servers it contacts.
   - However, the report does mention that the 'Outlook.exe' payload opens a listening TCP socket on localhost, suggesting potential communication capabilities.
   - The question introduces new information about the C2 servers (office365update[.]duckdns.org and systen32.ddns[.]net) and the geographical location of the attacker's infrastructure (Canada and Brazil), which is not directly mentioned in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Understand the attack sequence and the role of RevengeRAT in the campaign. RevengeRAT is known to be a remote access trojan (RAT), which typically allows attackers to access and control infected machines remotely.
   - **Step 2:** Recognize that RATs like RevengeRAT usually communicate with C2 servers to receive commands and send back stolen information.
   - **Step 3:** Consider the information provided in the question about the potential C2 servers and the location of the attacker's infrastructure. While this information is not directly from the CTI report, it's plausible given the context of how RATs operate.
   - **Step 4:** Evaluate the likelihood of RevengeRAT establishing communication with C2 servers based on its nature as a RAT and the information provided.

Given the nature of RevengeRAT as a remote access trojan and the typical behavior of such malware, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing persistence, RevengeRAT would likely attempt to communicate with its C2 servers to receive further instructions and potentially exfiltrate data. The introduction of specific C2 server domains and the geographical location of the attacker's infrastructure in the question, while not directly from the CTI report, aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with RATs and cyber attack campaigns.

**Final Answer: A**
