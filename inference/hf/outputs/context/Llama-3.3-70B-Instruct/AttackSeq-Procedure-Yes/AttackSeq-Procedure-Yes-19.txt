To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the "Machete" malware, which is distributed through social engineering tactics.
   - Initial Access is gained through spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website, with the malware embedded in PowerPoint presentations.
   - Persistence is achieved by creating a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/', along with creating a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
   - The report mentions that the malware is used for spying, indicated by its detection as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua, suggesting it is capable of collecting sensitive information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information.
   - This implies examining the potential actions of the malware post-persistence, specifically focusing on its capabilities for data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention keystroke logging or copying files to a USB device.
   - However, given that "Machete" is classified as a Trojan-Spy, it is reasonable to infer that it has capabilities for collecting sensitive information.
   - The fact that it's a spyware implies it could be designed to capture keystrokes, among other sensitive data collection methods.
   - The report's mention of targeting high-profile institutions like intelligence services, military, and government institutions suggests the malware is designed for espionage, which would align with the capability to collect sensitive information through methods like keystroke logging.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the nature of the "Machete" malware as described in the CTI report. It is a spyware distributed through social engineering tactics.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the implications of its classification as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua, which suggests it is designed for spying and collecting sensitive information.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the targets of the malware, which include high-profile institutions, indicating the malware's purpose is likely espionage.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the question's specifics about keystroke logging and copying files to a USB device in the context of the malware's known capabilities and purpose.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the spyware nature of "Machete" and its targets, it is plausible that it would be capable of logging keystrokes and potentially copying files for the collection of sensitive information, even though these specific actions are not detailed in the report.

Final Answer: A
