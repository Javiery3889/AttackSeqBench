To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This document contains encrypted script data and an external template that, when downloaded, contains malicious VBA macros. The external template is fetched via URL shortening services, redirecting to a domain controlled by the attacker.

2. **Defense Evasion and Execution**: The VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data, dropping two files: 'fmx.ps1' (a PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code). The report does not explicitly state the sequence of execution after these files are dropped but implies that the 'fmx.ps1' script is involved in further malicious activities.

3. **Command and Control**: The Bandook loader injects a malicious payload into an Internet Explorer process using Process Hollowing and communicates with the C&C server, which involves sending information about the infected machine and awaiting commands.

Given this sequence, the question asks whether the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

- The report indicates that 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' are dropped after the VBA macros are executed. It suggests that 'fmx.ps1' is a PowerShell script, which could potentially decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'. However, it does not explicitly state that 'fmx.ps1' decodes 'sdmc.jpg' or that this happens before any potential download of malware components.

- The question implies a specific sequence of events (decoding 'sdmc.jpg' and then downloading a zip file) that is not directly outlined in the report. However, given the nature of the dropped files ('fmx.ps1' as a PowerShell script and 'sdmc.jpg' as base64 encoded PowerShell code), it is plausible that 'fmx.ps1' could be involved in decoding 'sdmc.jpg' as part of the attack's progression.

- The report does mention that the malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components, which aligns with the idea of 'sdmc.jpg' being used in a way that involves decoding its contents for malicious purposes.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence based on the information given and the typical behavior of such malware is that the 'fmx.ps1' script would indeed be involved in decoding and executing the contents of 'sdmc.jpg' as part of the attack's progression. This could potentially happen before or as part of the process to download additional components for the malware payload, given the role of such scripts in setting up the environment for the main payload.

Final Answer: A
