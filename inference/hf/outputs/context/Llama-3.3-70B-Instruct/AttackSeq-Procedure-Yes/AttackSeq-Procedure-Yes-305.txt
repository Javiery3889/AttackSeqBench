To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a phishing campaign targeting Russian banks.
   - The campaign used emails with malicious attachments (docx files) that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter, likely CVE-2017-0262.
   - The attachments contained obfuscated code and a multibyte XOR key.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the establishment of communication with a compromised server for command and control (C2) but focuses on the initial access vector.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the phishing campaign exploited the EPS filter vulnerability through malicious docx files before establishing communication with a compromised server for C2.
   - The question introduces a new element not directly mentioned in the report: communication with a compromised server at a specific IP address for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report confirms the use of malicious docx files exploiting the EPS filter vulnerability, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - The report does not provide details about the post-exploitation activities, such as communicating with a C2 server. However, establishing C2 is a common step after initial access in many cyber attacks to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Given the context, it's plausible that after gaining initial access through the exploited vulnerability, the attackers would establish communication with a C2 server to further their objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details an initial access tactic using phishing with malicious attachments.
   - The question posits a sequence of events that includes this initial access method followed by C2 communication.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention C2 communication, this is a common enough tactic in cyber attacks that it's reasonable to consider it a plausible next step after initial access.
   - Therefore, considering the typical flow of cyber attacks and the information provided, the most logical conclusion is that the campaign likely did exploit the vulnerability before potentially establishing C2 communication, even though the report does not directly state this sequence.

Final Answer: A
