To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The Sednit group uses a new component called Zebrocy, which includes downloaders and backdoors written in Delphi and AutoIt.
   - The attack begins with an email message containing malicious attachments (Microsoft Office documents or archives) that use VBA macros, exploits, or DDE to download the first-stage payload.
   - The VBA macro creates a randomly-named file in the %TEMP% directory, decodes the malware executable, and runs it using PowerShell or Scriptable Shell Objects.
   - The Delphi downloader, as the first stage, gathers information from the victim's computer and establishes persistence through a Windows registry entry.
   - The group uses social engineering to lure victims into opening these attachments.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Sednit group will gain initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents using VBA macros to download and run the first stage payload before executing malware via the Delphi downloader.
   - The key elements in the question are the use of email attachments with VBA macros for initial access and the execution of malware via the Delphi downloader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report confirms that the Sednit group's initial access to victim networks is primarily through email attachments containing malicious documents or archives that execute a VBA macro to download and run the first-stage payload.
   - The report also details that the Delphi downloader is used as part of this process, which aligns with the question's description of executing malware via the Delphi downloader after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by the Sednit group, which is through email attachments with malicious documents or archives.
   - **Step 2**: Confirm that these attachments use VBA macros to download and run the first-stage payload, which matches the question's description.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the Delphi downloader is part of the Sednit group's toolkit and is involved in the early stages of the attack, including gathering information and establishing persistence.
   - **Step 4**: Since the CTI report and the question both describe a scenario where initial access is gained through email attachments with VBA macros, followed by the involvement of the Delphi downloader, it is reasonable to conclude that this sequence of events is likely.

**Final Answer: A**
