To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by FamousSparrow, including Initial Access through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - For Execution, they used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing SparrowDoor.
   - The report mentions various tactics such as Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration.
   - Specifically, for Exfiltration, it's mentioned that FamousSparrow exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining Initial Access and executing SparrowDoor, it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.
   - The question focuses on the communication method between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly state the communication protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) used between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.
   - However, given the context of modern malware and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of sophisticated threat actors like FamousSparrow, it is common for malware to use encrypted channels for communication to evade detection.
   - The use of encrypted channels, such as HTTPS, provides a layer of protection against network traffic inspection, making it harder for defenders to detect and intercept the communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question, which are the exploitation of vulnerabilities for Initial Access, the execution of SparrowDoor, and the method of communication with the C&C server.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTPS for C&C communication, the context suggests that using an encrypted channel would be a plausible tactic for evasion.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the common practices of threat actors to use encryption for hiding their communications, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactics mentioned in the report.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the common TTPs of sophisticated threat actors, it is reasonable to infer that SparrowDoor would likely communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel, such as HTTPS, to maintain stealth and evade detection.

Final Answer: A
