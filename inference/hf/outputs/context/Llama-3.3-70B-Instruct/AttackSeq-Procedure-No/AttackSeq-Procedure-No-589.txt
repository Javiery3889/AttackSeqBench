To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gholee malware campaign, which starts with a spear phishing attack using a malicious Excel file.
   - The malware uses Macro code to create and execute a PE file named NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll.
   - The report mentions that the malware employs obfuscation and includes mechanisms to hide from debuggers and sandbox software.
   - The entry point of the malware is named 'gholee', and it uses techniques to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing communication and performing Command and Control (C2) operations, the Gholee malware is likely to obfuscate its entry point to evade defense mechanisms.
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: establishing communication, using an expired digital certificate, sending HTTP communication for C2, and then potentially obfuscating its entry point.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know the Gholee malware already employs obfuscation and evasion techniques, including hiding from debuggers and sandbox software.
   - The question's sequence of actions (communication, C2 operations) is not directly detailed in the report but is consistent with the behavior of malware that seeks to establish a foothold in a system and then communicate back to its command and control servers.
   - Given that the malware is described as using obfuscation and evasion techniques, it is reasonable to infer that it would continue to use such methods to maintain its presence in the system undetected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Gholee malware's behavior, as described, includes using obfuscation and evasion techniques.
   - The question posits a scenario where the malware has established communication and is performing C2 operations, which would logically be followed by attempts to maintain stealth and evade detection.
   - Given the malware's known use of obfuscation and evasion, it is plausible that it would continue to use such techniques, including obfuscating its entry point, to evade defense mechanisms.

Final Answer: A
