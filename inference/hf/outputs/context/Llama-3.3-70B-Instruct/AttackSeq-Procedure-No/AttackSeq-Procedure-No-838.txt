To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear-phishing campaigns with malicious URLs or exploit documents to gain initial access. They exploit vulnerabilities to install malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 evades defenses by using zero-day vulnerabilities, public code, and legitimate tools within the victim's system.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvest credentials through spear-phishing, fake login pages, and credential harvesters.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT28 uses strategic web compromises and exploits vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move deeper into networks.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing and delivering exploit documents, APT28 is likely to install and execute a VBA script (like vba_macro.exe) to drop malware (like FONTCACHE.DAT) before using specific tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report mentions that APT28 delivers exploit documents as part of their initial access tactics, which can include installing malware.
   - The use of VBA scripts (e.g., vba_macro.exe) to drop malware is a plausible next step after initial access, as it aligns with the tactics of using exploit documents and installing malware.
   - The report does not specifically mention the tools CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE, but it does indicate that APT28 uses various tools and tactics for lateral movement and defense evasion, which could include the mentioned tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** APT28 uses spear-phishing with exploit documents for initial access, which matches the initial part of the question.
   - **Step 2:** The execution of a VBA script to drop malware is a tactic that could follow the initial access, given the group's use of exploit documents and malware installation.
   - **Step 3:** The question's mention of specific tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE) is not directly supported by the CTI report, but the report does suggest APT28's adaptability and use of various tools, making it plausible they could use such tools in their operations.

Given the information in the CTI report and the tactics described, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access, APT28 could engage in activities like installing and executing VBA scripts to drop malware as part of their broader campaign, which might include the use of various tools for further exploitation.

**Final Answer: A**
