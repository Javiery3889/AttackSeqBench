To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report discusses the AtomBombing technique, which is used for Defense Evasion.
   - AtomBombing allows threat actors to inject malicious code into trusted processes, bypassing security products without exploiting OS bugs or vulnerabilities.
   - This technique enables access to sensitive data and can perform actions like taking screenshots, MitB attacks, and accessing encrypted passwords.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using AtomBombing for code injection via legitimate programs, threat actors are likely to use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script, such as embedding it in a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.
   - The question essentially inquires about the potential sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report highlights the AtomBombing technique as a method for injecting malicious code into trusted processes, which is a form of Defense Evasion (MITRE ATT&CK tactic).
   - Using VBA scripts embedded in documents (like Word documents) is another technique that can be used for initial access or execution (also part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework), allowing malicious code to run on a victim's system.
   - Given that AtomBombing is about evading defenses and executing code within trusted processes, and considering that VBA scripts can be used to execute malicious code, it's plausible that threat actors could use both techniques as part of a broader strategy to compromise a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the primary technique discussed - AtomBombing for Defense Evasion.
   - **Step 2:** Understand the question's context - the potential use of VBA scripts after employing AtomBombing.
   - **Step 3:** Recognize that both techniques (AtomBombing and using VBA scripts) can be used for executing malicious code, albeit in different stages or manners of an attack.
   - **Step 4:** Consider the logical flow of an attack - initial compromise (possibly through a VBA script in a document) followed by evasion techniques (like AtomBombing) to maintain access or execute further malicious activities.

Given the information and analysis, it seems plausible that threat actors could use a combination of techniques, including AtomBombing for defense evasion and VBA scripts for initial execution or as part of their strategy to compromise and maintain access to a system.

**Final Answer: A**
