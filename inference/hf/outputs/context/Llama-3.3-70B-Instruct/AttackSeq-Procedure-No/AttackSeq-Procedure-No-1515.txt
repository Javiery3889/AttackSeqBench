To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** via spear-phishing emails containing malicious DOCX documents.
   - The sequence proceeds to **Execution**, where vulnerabilities are exploited to install a backdoor.
   - **Persistence** is established through a scheduled task.
   - The attackers use **Defense Evasion** techniques, including anti-analysis and anti-debugging.
   - The **Discovery** phase involves gathering information about the victim's computer.
   - **Collection** of a wide range of data from the victim's system is facilitated by the backdoor.
   - **Command and Control** communication is encrypted and involves sending and receiving specific messages.
   - **Exfiltration** capabilities include sending various data types back to the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the backdoor shuts down the victim's computer, it is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.
   - The key elements here are the shutdown of the victim's computer and the exfiltration of data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer as part of its capabilities or the attack sequence. It focuses on the installation, persistence, data collection, and exfiltration capabilities of the backdoor.
   - The report does mention that the backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.
   - However, the scenario presented in the question (shutting down the victim's computer) is not directly addressed in the report as a precursor to data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report clearly states the backdoor's capability for data exfiltration over an encrypted C&C channel.
   - However, the action of shutting down the victim's computer to disrupt operations is not mentioned in the report as part of the attack sequence or the backdoor's capabilities.
   - Given that shutting down the computer would likely terminate any running processes, including the backdoor, it seems implausible that the backdoor could exfiltrate data after such an event.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the most logical conclusion is that if the backdoor shuts down the victim's computer, it would not be able to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel because it would no longer be operational.

Final Answer: B
