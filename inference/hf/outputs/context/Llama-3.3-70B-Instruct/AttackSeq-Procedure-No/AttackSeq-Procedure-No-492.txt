To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Harvester group, a likely nation-state-backed actor.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: The group initiated their campaign, with the first evidence being a malicious URL on victim machines.
     2. **Execution**: Deployed a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon), a custom downloader, and a custom screenshot tool.
     3. **Persistence**: The custom downloader sets a registry value for persistence.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Leveraged legitimate infrastructure for C&C activities and used a decoy URL.
     5. **Collection**: The custom screenshot tool captures and saves screenshots to a password-protected ZIP archive.
     6. **Exfiltration**: The custom screenshot tool saves captured screenshots to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection, it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the use of specific tools (custom screenshot tool, custom backdoor, and potentially Cobalt Strike Beacon) for command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the Harvester group leveraged legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities, indicating a preference for blending in with legitimate traffic.
   - There is no explicit mention of the FTP protocol being used for C2 communication in the report.
   - The use of a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) and the mention of leveraging legitimate infrastructure for C2 suggest that the group might use more covert or encrypted methods for communication, rather than a protocol like FTP which could be more easily detected.
   - Cobalt Strike Beacon is not mentioned in the CTI report, but it is known to be a tool that can be used for C2 communication, often in a more stealthy manner than traditional protocols like FTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the Harvester group's C2 communication, which is to remain stealthy and blend in with legitimate traffic.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the use of FTP for C2 communication would be less stealthy and more easily detectable compared to leveraging legitimate cloud services.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the tools mentioned (custom backdoor, custom screenshot tool) and their capabilities, which suggest a focus on stealth and evasion.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided and the typical behaviors of nation-state-backed actors, who often prioritize stealth and evasion in their operations.
   
Given the emphasis on stealth, evasion, and the use of legitimate infrastructure for C2 activities, it is less likely that the Harvester group would use a protocol like FTP for C2 communication, which could be more easily detected and blocked.

**Final Answer: B**
