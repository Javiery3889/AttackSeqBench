To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through social engineering and document-based exploits.
     2. **Execution**: Utilizing a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
     3. **Persistence**: Creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
     4. **Credential Access**: Targeting various software and Windows credentials.
     5. **Discovery**: Searching for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
     6. **Collection**: Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     7. **Command and Control (C2)**: Communicating via HTTP GET requests, with data exfiltration and updates via FTP and WebDav servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting information, CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The key detail here is understanding how CosmicDuke handles data exfiltration in relation to its C2 communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know that CosmicDuke uses HTTP GET requests for C2 communications.
   - For data exfiltration, it uses FTP and WebDav servers, which implies that while the initial C2 might be over HTTP, the actual exfiltration of collected data (like keylogged information, screenshots, and clipboard content) is facilitated through different protocols (FTP and WebDav).
   - This distinction is crucial because it separates the command and control channel (used for receiving instructions and possibly sending back small amounts of data) from the data exfiltration channels (used for transferring larger amounts of stolen data).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify how CosmicDuke communicates for C2 purposes: via HTTP GET requests.
   - **Step 2**: Determine how CosmicDuke exfiltrates data: via FTP and WebDav servers.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate if these are the same channels: They are not the same; C2 is primarily over HTTP, while exfiltration uses FTP and WebDav.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the distinction between the channels used for C2 and those used for exfiltration, it's reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke does not exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

Final Answer: B
