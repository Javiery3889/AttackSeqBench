To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Taidoor malware campaign, which starts with a spear-phishing email containing an attachment that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability to install the malware.
   - The malware beacons to a command-and-control (CnC) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
   - The report mentions that Taidoor has evolved to avoid detection by using a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after communicating with specific CnC servers, the Taidoor malware is likely to avoid detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware.
   - The question implies a sequence of events where communication with CnC servers is followed by an attempt to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the initial installation and communication with CnC servers, Taidoor has mechanisms to evolve and avoid detection.
   - The specific mention of using a 'downloader' to retrieve and decrypt a modified version of the malware is a tactic used by the newer variant of Taidoor to avoid common network detection signatures.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the Taidoor malware after initial access, which is to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that communication with CnC servers is an early step in the malware's operation, which would logically be followed by attempts to maintain access and evade detection.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware is a described tactic for evasion, indicating an evolution in the malware's behavior post-initial communication.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the tactics described, it is reasonable to conclude that after communicating with the command-and-control servers, the Taidoor malware would attempt to avoid detection by evolving its presence on the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
