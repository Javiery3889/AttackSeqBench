To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability.
     2. **Execution**: PowerShell scripts and batch file execution to download and run additional files, including the Milestone backdoor.
     3. **Persistence**: Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself and creating a service.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Creation of a new administrator user and execution of the backdoor with elevated privileges.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Use of a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide malicious artifacts.
     6. **Discovery**: Milestone backdoor performs system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, the Milestone backdoor is likely to communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves **Discovery** (system information and screen capture) followed by **Exfiltration**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the Milestone backdoor is installed and performs its discovery functions, it exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - The question of whether this communication happens over a non-standard port is not directly addressed in the report, but the use of a C2 channel for exfiltration is confirmed.
   - Given the context, it's reasonable to infer that communication with a C2 server for exfiltration purposes could involve non-standard ports, as this is a common tactic to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Milestone backdoor's capabilities include system information discovery, screen capture, and exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
   - The use of non-standard ports for C2 communication is a common tactic among threat actors to avoid detection.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of non-standard ports, the context suggests that after performing discovery activities, the backdoor would likely communicate with its C2 server, potentially using non-standard ports, before exfiltrating data.
   - Therefore, based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is plausible that the Milestone backdoor would communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: A
