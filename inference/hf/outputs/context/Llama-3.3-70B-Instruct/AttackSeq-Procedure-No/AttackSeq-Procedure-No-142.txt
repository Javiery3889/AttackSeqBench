To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions an initial access tactic in July to August 2011, where attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
   - Following this initial access, the report mentions that the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for various accounts through several different phishing domains during the same period (July to August 2011).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after gaining initial access via an Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, it is likely that the attack group harvested user login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The question essentially inquires about the method used for credential access after initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that after the initial access in July to August 2011, the attack group attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains.
   - This indicates that the primary method mentioned for credential access after initial compromise was indeed through phishing, not directly harvesting credentials without phishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method and subsequent actions. The initial access was via an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the method used for credential access after initial compromise. According to the report, phishing domains were used to gather user credentials.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the question's premise. The question asks if the group likely harvested user login credentials instead of using phishing domains. However, the report indicates that phishing was the method used for credential access.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is not likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials without using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, as the report explicitly mentions the use of phishing domains for this purpose.

Final Answer: B
