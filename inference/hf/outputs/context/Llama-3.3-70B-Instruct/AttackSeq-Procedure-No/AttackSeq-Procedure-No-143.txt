To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: The report mentions two instances of initial access. The first occurred from July to August 2011, where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability was exploited to gain access to victim networks. The second instance, in February 2014, involved a watering hole attack that delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit.

2. **Credential Access**: The attempt to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains also occurred from July to August 2011.

3. **Sequence Analysis**: Based on the provided timeline, the attempt to gather user credentials through phishing domains happened concurrently with the exploitation of the Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access in July to August 2011. This suggests that the credential gathering attempt was part of the early stages of the attack, potentially after or simultaneously with the initial compromise.

4. **Question Analysis**: The question asks if, after deploying a second-stage implant (which is part of the later stages of the attack, as seen in the 2015 activities), it is likely that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains only after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks.

5. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given the timeline, the gathering of user credentials through phishing occurred early in the campaign (July to August 2011), around the same time as the initial access via the Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. The deployment of a second-stage implant, as mentioned in the question, refers to activities that happened later (in 2015). The question essentially asks if the credential gathering was a step that occurred after the initial access. According to the report, these events were concurrent or closely timed, suggesting that credential gathering was indeed an early objective, potentially initiated after or at the same time as the initial access.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the timeline and the sequence of events, the most plausible interpretation is that the credential gathering attempt was indeed made after or concurrently with the initial access via the Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. However, the question's phrasing implies a linear sequence that might not fully capture the complexity of the actual events. Given the information and focusing strictly on the question's requirements, the answer that aligns best with the provided sequence and the question's framing would be:
