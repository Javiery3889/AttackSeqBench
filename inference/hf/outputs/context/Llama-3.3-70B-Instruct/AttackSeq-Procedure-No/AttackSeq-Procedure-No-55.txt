To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the Lazarus group against the defense industry.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Using spear-phishing emails with personal information to target defense industry departments.
     2. **Initial Access**: Achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents that download and execute additional malware when macros are enabled.
     3. **Execution**: The malware (ThreatNeedle) is executed in a multistage deployment, starting with a spear-phishing document that loads a backdoor running in-memory for initial reconnaissance and deploying additional malware.
     4. **Persistence**: ThreatNeedle installer-type malware implants a loader-type malware for auto-execution.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques include deleting log files, using a custom web shell script, and masquerading.
     6. **Credential Access**: Executing a credential harvesting tool to acquire login credentials.
     7. **Lateral Movement**: Using Windows commands, WMIC, and compromising a router virtual machine.
     8. **Collection**: Archiving collected data for exfiltration.
     9. **Command and Control**: Involves multiple servers and configuring a compromised router as a proxy server.
     10. **Exfiltration**: Using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory only after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, before conducting discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - After initial access, the report mentions the execution of the ThreatNeedle malware in a multistage deployment, which includes running a backdoor in-memory for initial reconnaissance and deploying additional malware.
   - This sequence aligns with the question's description of gaining initial access and then executing the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by Lazarus, which was through spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the next step after initial access, which according to the report, involves the execution of the ThreatNeedle malware.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the execution of ThreatNeedle includes running a backdoor in-memory, which is a critical step for further reconnaissance and deploying additional malware.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the sequence described in the question (gaining initial access through spear-phishing and then executing the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory) matches the attack sequence outlined in the CTI report.
   
**Final Answer: A**
