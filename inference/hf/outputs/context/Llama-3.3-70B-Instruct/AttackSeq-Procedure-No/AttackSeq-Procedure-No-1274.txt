To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access** using the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - The sequence then moves through **Execution**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Discovery**, **Lateral Movement**, **Command and Control**, and finally **Impact**.
   - The report does not explicitly mention a **Reconnaissance** phase involving research of software code for supply-chain operations before the use of the SocGholish framework.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers researched software code to enable supply-chain operations as part of the **Reconnaissance** phase before using the SocGholish framework.
   - The question implies a specific action (researching software code for supply-chain operations) as part of the attack planning or preparation phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention a **Reconnaissance** phase or any activities related to researching software code for supply-chain operations before the initial compromise.
   - The report starts with the **Initial Access** tactic, which involves the SocGholish framework and malicious JavaScript, indicating that the described attack sequence begins with the execution of malicious code rather than the planning or reconnaissance phase.
   - While the attackers demonstrated skill and experience, including penetrating well-protected corporations and moving across networks with ease, the report focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed during the attack rather than pre-attack reconnaissance activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report does not provide direct evidence or mention of a **Reconnaissance** phase involving software code research for supply-chain operations before the initial compromise.
   - The question asks about a specific activity (researching software code) as part of the **Reconnaissance** phase, which is not explicitly covered in the report.
   - Given the information provided in the CTI report, it is not possible to confirm that the attackers engaged in software code research as part of a **Reconnaissance** phase before using the SocGholish framework.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided, the most appropriate answer would be that it is not explicitly stated or confirmed by the report.

Final Answer: B
