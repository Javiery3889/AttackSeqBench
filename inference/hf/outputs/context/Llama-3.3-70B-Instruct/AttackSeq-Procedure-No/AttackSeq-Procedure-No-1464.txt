To answer this question, let's break down the steps outlined in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the adversaries.

1. **Initial Access**: The adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, sending emails with weaponized MS Office attachments. When employees open these attachments and enable macros, BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed on their workstations.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: After the installation of BlackEnergy 3, the malware can conduct various malicious activities, including communicating with command and control (C2) servers.

3. **Credential Access and Discovery**: The report mentions that delivered BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions. This implies that after gaining initial access and executing the malware, the adversaries use it for internal reconnaissance and to gather credentials.

4. **Use of Legitimate Utilities**: The question asks about the use of legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting. While the report specifically mentions the use of BlackEnergy 3 plugins for these purposes and the use of MS Sysinternals PsExec for network discovery, it does not explicitly mention AnyDesk and PuTTy. However, the use of such legitimate utilities for maintaining access and facilitating movement within the network is a common TTP among adversaries. The report does mention the use of valid credentials and tools like PsExec for lateral movement and network discovery, which aligns with the concept of using existing, legitimate tools for these purposes.

Given the information provided in the CTI report and understanding common adversary TTPs:

- The adversaries use phishing emails with weaponized attachments to gain initial access.
- They install BlackEnergy 3, which can facilitate further malicious activities, including communication with C2 servers and potentially using built-in or additional tools for network discovery and credential harvesting.
- The use of legitimate utilities for remote access and network discovery is a plausible next step, as it aligns with known tactics to blend in with normal network activity and leverage existing tools to minimize detection.

Therefore, considering the sequence of events and the tactics typically employed by adversaries, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access and installing BlackEnergy 3, the malware could use legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments before or as part of enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
