To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The report mentions that before the attack, adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods such as scanning perimeter devices and social media data collection. This step is about gathering intelligence on potential targets.

2. **Initial Access and Execution**: The report states that adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) after employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. This indicates that the initial access vector involves exploiting user-enabled macro execution in MS Office documents.

3. **Malware Execution and Payload Delivery**: After installation, BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions. The report does not specifically mention Ruby scripts in the context of executing payloads or the operation of BlackEnergy 3.

Given these points, let's evaluate the question:

- The question asks if, after reconnaissance activities and the installation of malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution, it is likely that these implants will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads.

- The CTI report does not mention Ruby scripts as part of the BlackEnergy 3 operation or its payload execution mechanism. Instead, it focuses on the use of VBA scripts (Visual Basic for Applications) for the initial installation of the malware through macro execution in MS Office documents.

Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no indication that Ruby scripts are used by BlackEnergy 3 for executing payloads after being installed on the network. The report specifically mentions the use of VBA scripts for the initial installation of the malware, not Ruby scripts.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access vector: Phishing campaign leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution.
2. Determine the scripting language used for initial installation: VBA scripts (macro execution in MS Office documents).
3. Evaluate the mention of Ruby scripts in the report: Ruby scripts are not mentioned in the context of BlackEnergy 3's operation or payload execution.
4. Conclusion: Based on the provided information, it is unlikely that Ruby scripts are used by BlackEnergy 3 for executing payloads.

**Final Answer: B**
