To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the VERMIN malware, a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that uses HTTP encapsulated SOAP for command and control.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is initially executed, often through a decoy document, and checks the system's language settings.
   - **Execution**: After execution, it collects system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and installed anti-virus software) and sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Persistence**: Establishes persistence through a scheduled task and saves parameters to `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Uses ConfuserEx for obfuscation and avoids installing the keylogger if anti-virus software is detected.
   - **Discovery**: Collects system information via WMI queries.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information, the keylogger component will collect keystrokes and clipboard data and store them encrypted in a specific folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the malware collects system information, including machine name, username, and local IP address.
   - It also mentions the use of a keylogger component but notes that this component is not installed if anti-virus software is detected.
   - The report specifies that the malware saves and encrypts its parameters to `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`, but it does not explicitly state where the keylogger stores its collected data.
   - However, the question implies a specific behavior (storing keystrokes and clipboard data in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`) that is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on the VERMIN malware's behavior, including its collection of system information and its use of a keylogger component under certain conditions.
   - However, the specific action of the keylogger component storing data in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings` is not mentioned in the report.
   - Given the information provided, we cannot confirm the exact behavior of the keylogger component as described in the question.
   - Therefore, based on the information in the CTI report, we cannot definitively say "yes" to the question as it specifies a detail (the storage location of the keylogger's collected data) not covered in the report.

Final Answer: B
