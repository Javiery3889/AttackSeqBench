To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the OceanLotus backdoor's attack sequence:
     1. **Initial Access**: Delivered via a zip file, presumably through an email attachment, containing a disguised Microsoft Word document that executes the Trojan.
     2. **Execution**: The backdoor executes, displays a decoy document, and opens a hidden file.
     3. **Persistence**: Creates a Launch Agent for startup, copies itself to a new location, and deletes the original application bundle.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs string encoding, avoids command line utilities, and uses a custom binary protocol with encryption for C2 communication.
     5. **Discovery**: Surveys the victim's computer, gathering details like the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which are then encrypted and sent to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initiating command and control communication, the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather and transmit details.
   - The key elements here are the initiation of C2 communication and the surveying of the victim's computer for information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we see that after establishing persistence and evading defenses, the backdoor indeed surveys the victim's computer as part of its **Discovery** tactic.
   - The question specifies the use of a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode for C2 communication, which aligns with the report's description of the backdoor's communication method, indicating an advanced and secure method of communicating with its C2 server.
   - Given that the backdoor has established a secure means of communication, it is logical that it would proceed to gather and transmit sensitive information about the victim's system, as described in the **Discovery** phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The OceanLotus backdoor's behavior, as described, includes a phase dedicated to surveying the victim's computer and sending the gathered information to its C2 server.
   - The initiation of secure C2 communication would naturally precede or coincide with the need to send collected system information.
   - Therefore, after establishing secure C2 communication, it is highly likely that the backdoor would proceed with surveying the victim's computer to gather and transmit the specified details.

Final Answer: A
