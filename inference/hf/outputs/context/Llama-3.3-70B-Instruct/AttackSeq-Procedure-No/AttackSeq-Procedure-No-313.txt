To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Dragonfly campaign's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics: 
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through spear-phishing, watering holes, and supply-chain exploits.
     2. **Resource Development**: Creating or gaining user accounts and using remote-desktop protocol (RDP) for operations.
     3. **Initial Access**: Targeting energy companies via spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
     4. **Execution**: Using backdoor malware for code execution without detection.
     5. **Persistence**: Creating or gaining user accounts and using RDP for movement.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Incorporating legitimate application code (TeamViewer) into their backdoor and using self-deleting code.
     7. **Lateral Movement**: Using RDP to move among systems.
     8. **Impact**: Capability for disruptive and destructive actions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using self-deleting code for defense evasion, the Dragonfly group likely used RDP for lateral movement before focusing on Windows systems for discovery (gathering system information).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that after gaining access and executing code, the Dragonfly group used defense evasion techniques, including self-deleting code, to avoid detection.
   - Following defense evasion, the report mentions lateral movement using RDP to hop among internal or external systems, which aligns with the question's scenario.
   - The question implies a sequence where after defense evasion (using self-deleting code), the group moves laterally (using RDP) and then focuses on discovery (gathering system information on Windows systems). The report supports the use of RDP for lateral movement after defense evasion but does not explicitly state that this movement is directly followed by a discovery phase focused on Windows systems. However, given the context, it's plausible that after establishing a foothold and evading defenses, the group would move laterally and then engage in discovery activities, which could include gathering system information from Windows systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the sequence of tactics in the CTI report and understand the question's context.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report supports the use of RDP for lateral movement after initial access and defense evasion tactics.
   - **Step 3**: Consider that while the report does not explicitly link lateral movement directly to a discovery phase focused on Windows systems, the overall attack sequence suggests a progression from access and evasion to movement and potentially further internal reconnaissance or discovery.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the logical progression of attack tactics, it is plausible that after using self-deleting code for defense evasion, the Dragonfly group would use RDP for lateral movement as part of their campaign, which could precede or include discovery activities such as gathering system information from Windows systems.

Final Answer: A
