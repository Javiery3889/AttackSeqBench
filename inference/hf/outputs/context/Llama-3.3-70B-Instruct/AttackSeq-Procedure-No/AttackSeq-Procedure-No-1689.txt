To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with an email containing a malicious PDF attachment that appeared benign and passed through security filters.
   - **Execution:** The attachment initiated the attack by executing scripts and batch files, leading to the decryption of files and the extraction of contents.
   - **Persistence:** The attack used modifications to the Windows registry and legitimate applications to maintain persistence and collect credentials.
   - **Credential Access:** Legitimate applications were used to collect credentials, which were then saved and uploaded to an external FTP server.
   - **Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration:** The attack involved the recurrent collection of credentials, their transmission to an external server, and exfiltration of stolen data over a long period.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations, starting with the sending of a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the attack indeed used legitimate applications and scripts for its operations, such as collecting credentials and maintaining persistence. This approach can help evade detection since the use of legitimate tools does not typically trigger security alerts in the same way malicious executables might.
   - The initial vector, a PDF attachment that appeared benign and passed through security filters, also contributed to the attack's ability to evade detection initially.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The attack started with a benign-appearing PDF, which is a common social engineering tactic to gain initial access without arousing suspicion.
   - **Step 2:** The use of legitimate tools and scripts for credential collection and persistence helps in evading detection, as these activities might be mistaken for normal system operations.
   - **Step 3:** The fact that the attack went undetected for a long time, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013, suggests that the strategy of using legitimate tools and scripts, combined with the initial stealthy entry method, was effective in evading detection.

**Final Answer: A**
