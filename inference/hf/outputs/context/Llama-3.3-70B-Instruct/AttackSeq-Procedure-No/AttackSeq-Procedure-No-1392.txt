To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 maps victim networks, captures credentials, and steals sensitive documents.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employs JSPRAT for command execution and uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
     4. **Persistence**: Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK, and email communications for command and control.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizes utilities like ProcDump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employs passive backdoors, chains web shells, and uses legitimate utilities for evasion.
     7. **Discovery**: Leverages native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells for lateral movement.
     9. **Collection**: Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
     10. **Command and Control**: Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
   - The key elements here are the retrieval of secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and the use of native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not specifically mention FIN13 targeting cloud services like AWS or using modules like enum_secrets to retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager. FIN13's focus, as described, is more on traditional network intrusion, lateral movement, and data exfiltration within the victim's on-premises network.
   - The report highlights FIN13's use of native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with gathering information on network and host configurations but does not specify actions against cloud services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify FIN13's primary targets and methods. FIN13 primarily targets financial, retail, and hospitality industries in Mexico, focusing on long-term intrusions and financial gain through fraudulent transactions.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if FIN13's known TTPs include cloud service exploitation. The report does not mention specific actions against cloud services like AWS.
   - **Step 3**: Assess the likelihood of FIN13 using a specific module (enum_secrets) for retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Given the lack of information on FIN13's involvement with cloud services, this seems unlikely based on the provided CTI report.
   - **Step 4**: Consider FIN13's methods for reconnaissance. They use native OS binaries and custom tools for internal reconnaissance, which is consistent with gathering network and host configurations but does not directly relate to retrieving secrets from cloud services.

**Final Answer: B**
