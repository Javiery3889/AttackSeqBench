To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by FamousSparrow, including Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - **Discovery**: SparrowDoor collects system information (usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, drive types) and probes files in specified directories.
     - **Credential Access** is not explicitly mentioned in the provided report, but it's implied that the group has capabilities for further exploitation, given their use of various tactics.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that FamousSparrow collects system information and probes files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: Credential Access (using Mimikatz) followed by Discovery (collecting system information and probing files).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of Mimikatz or any specific Credential Access techniques by FamousSparrow. However, it outlines a comprehensive set of tactics that suggest a sophisticated approach to compromising and exploiting target systems.
   - The report does indicate that Discovery involves collecting system information and probing files, which could logically follow initial exploitation and potentially credential dumping as part of a broader campaign to understand and exploit the target environment.
   - Given the tactics described, it's plausible that FamousSparrow would engage in Credential Access (possibly using tools like Mimikatz, though not specified) as part of their operations, which would then be followed by or include Discovery activities to further understand the compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question, which involves a sequence of TTPs (Credential Access followed by Discovery).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report does not explicitly mention Credential Access using Mimikatz, the described tactics suggest a capability for sophisticated exploitation.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the logical flow of a cyber attack, where initial access and exploitation (potentially including credential dumping) are often followed by discovery and further exploitation.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis. Given the information provided and the typical flow of cyber attacks, it's reasonable to assume that Discovery activities (like collecting system information and probing files) could occur after or as part of a broader set of exploitation activities that might include Credential Access.

**Final Answer: A**
