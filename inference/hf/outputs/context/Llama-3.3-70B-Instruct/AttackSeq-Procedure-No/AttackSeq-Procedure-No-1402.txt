To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
   - Key points include:
     - **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials.
     - **Initial Access**: Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     - **Execution**: Employs JSPRAT for command execution and uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
     - **Persistence**: Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK, and email communications for command and control.
     - **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizes tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz for credential extraction.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Employs passive backdoors, chains web shells, and uses legitimate utilities for evasion.
     - **Credential Access**: Dumps LSASS process memory, uses network sniffing, and targets unsecured credentials.
     - **Discovery**: Leverages native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     - **Collection**: Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
     - **Command and Control**: Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
     - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after internal reconnaissance, FIN13 is likely to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs involving discovery, lateral movement (using specific tools), and then collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - FIN13's modus operandi (MO) involves long-term intrusions, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries, with a goal of facilitating fraudulent money transfers.
   - The report does not mention the use of AvosLocker or PDQ Deploy. Instead, it highlights the use of custom malware and tools like JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and SIXPACK for various stages of the attack.
   - FIN13's approach to lateral movement and tool deployment within the network is not explicitly described in terms of using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy or ransomware like AvosLocker. The report emphasizes the use of web shells, custom backdoors, and legitimate utilities for persistence and command and control.
   - The question introduces elements (AvosLocker and PDQ Deploy) not directly mentioned in the CTI report, suggesting a hypothetical scenario that does not align with the described TTPs of FIN13.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify FIN13's known TTPs from the report, focusing on discovery, lateral movement, and collection.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question for the specific sequence of TTPs it implies and the tools it mentions.
   - **Step 3**: Compare the known TTPs with the scenario presented in the question, noting any discrepancies or alignments.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of FIN13 using the tools and methods mentioned in the question based on their known MO and TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the CTI report does not mention AvosLocker or the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement, and considering FIN13's focus on custom malware and traditional cybercrime methods, it is unlikely that FIN13 would use these specific tools and methods as described in the question.

Final Answer: B
