To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign uses malicious documents with social engineering tactics to trick victims into enabling macros, which then activate the payload. Some payloads are embedded, while others are downloaded from the internet.
   - **Execution:** After macros are enabled, files are created in the ProgramData directory, including a .VBS script that executes a PowerShell script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The latest change includes dropping files like an .sct scriptlet file and an .inf file that use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker, indicating the use of obfuscation and evasion techniques.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the use of malicious documents for initial access and the employment of obfuscation techniques (including bypassing AppLocker) are part of the campaign's tactics. However, it does not imply that the use of malicious documents for payload delivery is conditional upon the use of obfuscation processes or AppLocker bypassing techniques.
   - The report suggests that the campaign has evolved, incorporating new techniques such as the use of .sct scriptlet files and .inf files for bypassing AppLocker, but it does not restrict the delivery of payloads through malicious documents to only after these evasion tactics are employed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The campaign uses social engineering through malicious documents for initial access.
   - The execution phase involves creating files that may include obfuscation and evasion techniques.
   - The question implies a sequence where obfuscation and evasion must precede the use of malicious documents for payload delivery, which is not directly supported by the report.
   - The report shows that malicious documents are a primary means of initial access and payload delivery, regardless of the specific evasion techniques used in the execution phase.

**Final Answer: B**
