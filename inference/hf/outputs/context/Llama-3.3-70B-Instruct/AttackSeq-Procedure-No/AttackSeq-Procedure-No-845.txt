To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** KerrDown is delivered via two methods: Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros and RAR archives with DLL side-loading. The primary targets seem to be in Vietnam or Vietnamese-speaking individuals.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The KerrDown DLL is dropped in a specific directory, retrieves a payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory. A VBS decode function is used to decode base64 blobs.
   - **Command and Control:** The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, downloaded based on the OS architecture of the victim machine.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after delivering KerrDown, it is likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The report mentions that KerrDown uses a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs as part of its defense evasion tactics. However, this is related to the execution and evasion techniques of the KerrDown DLL itself, not directly to the initial delivery mechanism via Office documents.
   - The initial delivery via Office documents involves malicious macros. The report does not specify that these macros directly use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture before instructing the victim to enable macros. Instead, it mentions the use of base64 blobs in the context of the KerrDown DLL's operation.
   - The question seems to conflate the initial delivery mechanism with the subsequent operations of the KerrDown malware, specifically its use of base64 decoding and the condition of executing based on the victim's system architecture.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access vector via Office documents with malicious macros is designed to deliver the KerrDown downloader.
   - The use of base64 blobs for decoding is a tactic employed by the KerrDown DLL for its operation, not explicitly mentioned as part of the initial macro-enabled document's function.
   - The question's scenario suggests a specific sequence and condition (using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture before containing an image file instructing to enable macros) that is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B**
