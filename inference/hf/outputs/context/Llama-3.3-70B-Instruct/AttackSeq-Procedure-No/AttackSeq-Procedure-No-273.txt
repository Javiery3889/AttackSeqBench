To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - **Initial Access**: Involves phishing and watering hole attacks, with filenames related to current events.
   - **Execution**: Utilizes a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence**: Establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory, copying necessary files, and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry to run at boot.
   - **Collection**: Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including listing files, directories, metadata, and content.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with encrypted communication.
   - **Exfiltration**: Performs data exfiltration via the same custom protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing communication with C&C servers, the Korplug variant is likely to collect system information only after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after the Korplug variant is executed, it establishes persistence and then proceeds with its malicious activities, which include collecting data from the system.
   - The collection of system information such as uptime, Windows version, and CPU clock rate is part of the data collection activities of Korplug.
   - The report does not explicitly state that data collection occurs immediately after establishing communication with C&C servers but implies that after persistence is established, the malware proceeds with its data collection activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Korplug variant first gains initial access, likely through phishing or watering hole attacks.
   - It then executes its payload using a custom loader, exploiting a vulnerability.
   - Persistence is established by creating a hidden directory and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry to ensure the malware runs at boot.
   - After establishing persistence, the malware communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - Given the nature of the Korplug variant's activities, which include collecting system information, it is reasonable to infer that such collection would occur after the malware has secured its presence on the system (i.e., after establishing persistence).
   - The question's phrasing suggests a sequence where communication with C&C servers precedes the collection of system information, which aligns with the malware's operational sequence of establishing persistence, communicating with C&C, and then proceeding with data collection activities.

**Final Answer: A**
