To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Hidden Cobra targeting Turkish financial organizations.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     2. **Initial Access**: Financial organizations in Turkey are targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
     3. **Execution**: The exploit executes the Bankshot implant.
     4. **Persistence**: Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Bankshot evades detection and can wipe files.
     6. **Command and Control**: The implant communicates with control servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after developing Bankshot implants, Hidden Cobra is likely to target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails that exploit CVE-2018-4878 for initial access.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves developing implants (Resource Development), using them for initial access via spear phishing and exploitation (Initial Access), and then presumably executing the implant for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly states that Hidden Cobra has targeted Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878.
   - The development of Bankshot implants with capabilities for full control and file wiping aligns with the tactics of Persistence and Defense Evasion described in the report.
   - Given that the report outlines a specific instance where Hidden Cobra used this method to target Turkish financial organizations, it suggests a pattern of behavior that could be repeated.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and tactics used by Hidden Cobra as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question essentially asks if the behavior described in the report (targeting via spear phishing and exploiting CVE-2018-4878) is likely to be repeated.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities of the Bankshot implant and its alignment with the tactics of Persistence and Defense Evasion.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given the direct evidence from the report and the alignment of the implant's capabilities with the described tactics, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would continue to use this method.
   
Final Answer: A
