To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Higaisa APT group, starting with Initial Access via spear-phishing with malicious LNK files.
   - The Execution phase involves a multi-stage attack, including decoding, decompressing, and executing a JavaScript file.
   - The JavaScript file performs several actions, including creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request.
   - The report does not mention adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks as part of the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing the JavaScript file, it is likely that 'svchhast.exe' will be copied to the startup directory only after 'officeupdate.exe' is added to scheduled tasks.
   - The question introduces 'officeupdate.exe' and its addition to scheduled tasks, which is not mentioned in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly mentions the copying of 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as one of the actions performed by the JavaScript file but does not condition this action on the addition of 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - Since 'officeupdate.exe' and its addition to scheduled tasks are not mentioned in the report, we cannot infer that this is a prerequisite for copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory based on the provided information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sequence of actions following the execution of the LNK file, including the execution of a JavaScript file.
   - The JavaScript file's actions include copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as part of maintaining persistence.
   - There is no mention of 'officeupdate.exe' or its addition to scheduled tasks as a condition for the copying of 'svchhast.exe'.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, it is unlikely that the copying of 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory is contingent upon 'officeupdate.exe' being added to scheduled tasks, as this detail is not mentioned in the report.

Final Answer: B
