To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines a cyber attack by the Lazarus Group on a pharmaceutical company.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Used system utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and unknown PE files.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gained through malicious documents sent to employees.
     3. **Execution**: Used system utilities, a backdoor named CommsCacher, and the Windows command line.
     4. **Persistence**: Created services and placed shortcuts in the startup folder.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Used encryption, hidden folders, and removed malware samples.
     7. **Lateral Movement**: Used compromised legitimate privileged accounts.
     8. **Command and Control**: Used standard HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after reconnaissance and initial access, the Lazarus Group likely used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement before using net user and SMBMap for network share discovery.
   - The key elements in the question are the sequence of actions: reconnaissance, initial access, lateral movement using compromised accounts, and then the use of specific tools (net user and SMBMap) for network share discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report confirms that after gaining initial access, the group executed various tactics, including privilege escalation and lateral movement.
   - The report specifies that for lateral movement, the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts.
   - However, the report does not explicitly mention the use of "net user and SMBMap" for network share discovery in the sequence of events. Instead, it mentions the use of system utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The question implies a specific sequence that includes the use of compromised accounts for lateral movement before using specific tools for network share discovery. The report supports the use of compromised accounts for lateral movement but does not detail the use of "net user and SMBMap" in this specific sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lazarus Group's tactics, as described, involve a sophisticated sequence of actions including reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - The question focuses on a specific part of this sequence, particularly whether the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement before using specific tools for network share discovery.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, it is clear that the group did use compromised accounts for lateral movement. However, the report does not explicitly state that this was done before using "net user and SMBMap" for network share discovery, as these specific tools are not mentioned in the context of the sequence provided in the question.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided and the sequence of events described in the CTI report, the most accurate answer to the question, considering the typical actions of the Lazarus Group and the details given, would be to acknowledge the use of compromised accounts for lateral movement but recognize the question's implication about the sequence involving "net user and SMBMap" is not directly supported by the report.

Final Answer: B
