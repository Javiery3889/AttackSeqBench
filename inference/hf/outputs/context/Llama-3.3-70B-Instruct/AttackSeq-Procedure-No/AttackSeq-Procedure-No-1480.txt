To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Duke group using various tactics and techniques, starting with Initial Access via phishing emails containing a Cozyduke payload.
   - The group then uses Defense Evasion techniques with Seaduke, a highly configurable and stealthy information-stealing Trojan.
   - Credential Access is gained through methods like Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
   - Collection involves retrieving system information, updating configurations, and more using Seaduke.
   - Exfiltration is done by archiving and sending sensitive information via legitimate cloud services.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the behavior of Seaduke after it has retrieved system information and deleted itself.
   - Specifically, it inquires if Seaduke calculates its command-and-control (C2) port by performing a specific mathematical operation on the IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details Seaduke's capabilities, including its ability to communicate with command and control servers through a highly encrypted and obfuscated protocol.
   - However, the report does not explicitly mention how Seaduke calculates its C2 port or if it involves mathematical operations on IP addresses.
   - Given Seaduke's sophisticated and highly configurable nature, it's plausible that it could use complex methods for determining its C2 communication parameters.
   - The question's specific scenario about calculating the C2 port by manipulating IP address octets is not directly addressed in the report but considering Seaduke's advanced capabilities, such a method is within the realm of possibility for a sophisticated malware like Seaduke.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the capabilities and behaviors of Seaduke as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report highlights Seaduke's sophistication and configurability.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that while the specific method of calculating the C2 port is not mentioned, Seaduke's advanced nature makes various complex communication methods plausible.
   - **Step 4**: Given the information and the context of Seaduke's capabilities, evaluate the likelihood of the described behavior.

Given the sophisticated and highly configurable nature of Seaduke, and without explicit information to the contrary, it's reasonable to consider that Seaduke could employ complex methods for determining its communication parameters, including the calculation of its C2 port. However, the report does not provide direct evidence or mention of such a specific method, making it a bit speculative based on the information given.

**Final Answer: B**
