To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines SideCopy APT's activities, including reconnaissance, resource development, initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - Key points include:
     - **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final payloads.
     - **Execution**: SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including njRAT for credential harvesting.
     - **Exfiltration**: SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials from central Indian government employees, including targeting Kavach, an MFA app, and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

2. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting, SideCopy is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
   - This implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where initial access is gained, njRAT is deployed, and then exfiltration of Kavach databases occurs.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The CTI report indicates that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files for initial access, followed by a complex infection chain to deliver payloads like njRAT.
   - After deploying njRAT, the report mentions that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases, which aligns with the idea of exfiltration happening after initial access and payload delivery.
   - The report does not suggest that exfiltration occurs independently of the initial access and infection chain; rather, it implies a sequence where initial access enables the deployment of malware (like njRAT) and subsequent exfiltration activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by SideCopy, which is through malicious LNK files.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the deployment of njRAT malware as part of the execution phase, post-initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases is a goal of SideCopy, facilitated by the deployment of specific plugins post-infection.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the sequence of gaining initial access, deploying njRAT, and then exfiltrating databases is consistent with the tactics and techniques described in the CTI report.
   
**Final Answer: A**
