To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** where an iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that runs in the background, collects various information, and has the ability to restart itself on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase outlines the capabilities of the app, including collecting text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, starting voice recording, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after uploading files via FTP as part of Command and Control (C2) operations, it is likely that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - The question focuses on the communication methods used by the malware for exfiltrating data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP for sending gathered information but highlights the app's ability to collect and presumably exfiltrate data.
   - The mention of uploading files via FTP protocol suggests that the malware uses established communication protocols for data exfiltration.
   - Given that the malware is designed to collect various types of data and considering typical C2 communication methods, it's plausible that the malware could use HTTP for data exfiltration, especially since FTP is mentioned for uploading files, implying multiple protocols might be used for different purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's ability to collect a wide range of data and its use of FTP for uploading files indicate a sophisticated C2 structure.
   - The use of HTTP for sending gathered information after performing routines on the device aligns with common tactics used by malware for data exfiltration, as HTTP is a widely used protocol that can blend in with normal network traffic.
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of HTTP for data exfiltration, the context provided suggests that the malware is capable of adapting its communication methods, making the use of HTTP plausible.
   - Therefore, considering the capabilities of the malware and common practices in malware communication, the most likely answer is that the app could send gathered information via HTTP after performing its routines, especially since the question implies a sequence of actions (uploading via FTP and then potentially sending via HTTP).

Final Answer: A
