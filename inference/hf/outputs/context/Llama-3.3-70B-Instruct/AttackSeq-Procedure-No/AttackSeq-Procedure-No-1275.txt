To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that starts with the execution of a malicious email attachment, which installs PoisonIvy, a backdoor Trojan.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Execution**: The attack begins with the execution of a malicious file from an email attachment.
     2. **Credential Access**: The attackers use the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes.
     3. **Lateral Movement**: They move laterally within the network using obtained credentials.
     4. **Collection**: Identify and copy desired intellectual property to staging servers.
     5. **Command and Control**: The PoisonIvy Trojan communicates with a C&C server.
     6. **Exfiltration**: The collected intellectual property is uploaded to a remote site.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors sent phishing emails containing malicious attachments to desired targets before conducting research on them.
   - The key elements here are the use of phishing emails as an initial attack vector and the presence of malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions the execution of a malicious email attachment as the initial step in the attack sequence, which directly implies that phishing emails were used.
   - The report does not detail the research phase on targets but focuses on the technical aspects of the attack. However, the use of targeted phishing emails typically involves some level of research to craft convincing emails.
   - Given that the attack starts with a malicious email attachment, it's reasonable to infer that the emails were sent to desired targets, likely after some form of research to make the emails convincing and increase the chance of the attachment being opened.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial vector of the attack from the CTI report, which is the execution of a malicious email attachment.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that for such an attack to be successful, the emails must be convincing, implying some level of research on the targets.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report does not explicitly mention the research phase but implies a targeted approach through the use of specific attachments, infer that research likely occurred to support the phishing effort.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the typical modus operandi of targeted phishing campaigns, it is reasonable to conclude that the threat actors did send phishing emails containing malicious attachments to desired targets, likely after conducting some research to make these emails more effective.

Final Answer: A
