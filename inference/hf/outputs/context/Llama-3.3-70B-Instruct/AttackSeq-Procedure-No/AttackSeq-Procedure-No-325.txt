To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions the discovery of iOS malware, part of Operation Pawn Storm, which is installed on already compromised systems and is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows.
   - **Execution:** The XAgent app is described as fully functional malware that, when installed on iOS 7, hides its icon and runs in the background. It can restart immediately if terminated. However, on iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The app collects information from the iOS device and sends it via HTTP (using POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands). The malware's communication includes a token to identify which module is communicating, and it can also upload files via FTP.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after collecting a list of processes for discovery, the XAgent app will execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the gathered information (including processes data) out via HTTP to the C2 server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The report indicates that the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background immediately after being installed on iOS 7 devices. This behavior is part of its execution phase, not necessarily dependent on sending gathered information to the C2 server.
   - The app does collect information and send it to the C2 server via HTTP, but the report does not specify that the execution (hiding the icon and running in the background) is contingent upon sending this information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The XAgent app's behavior of hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 is described as an immediate action upon installation, not as a response to sending data to the C2 server.
   - The collection and sending of information (including process lists) to the C2 server is a part of the app's functionality but is not directly linked to the condition of hiding its icon and running in the background as a prerequisite.

**Final Answer: B**
