To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the attack sequence of Operation Sharpshooter, which includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through masqueraded job recruitment activity.
     2. **Initial Access**: Malicious documents distributed via the internet, containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader.
     3. **Execution**: The macro executes, acting as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant.
     4. **Persistence**: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading its second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     5. **Command and Control**: Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Data is encrypted and obfuscated before being sent to the control server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after communicating with control servers, the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities only after ensuring persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests and has capabilities that include gathering information (e.g., drive and process information).
   - The question implies a sequence where communication with control servers is followed by discovery activities (fetching computer name and user name information) after ensuring persistence.
   - The report does mention that the implant has backdoor capabilities, including gathering information, but it does not explicitly state that this information gathering happens after persistence is established or as part of a specific sequence with communication with control servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The Rising Sun implant establishes communication with control servers, which is a point of command and control.
   - **Step 2**: The implant has the capability to gather various types of information, which could include computer name and user name as part of its backdoor capabilities.
   - **Step 3**: Persistence is ensured by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder, which allows the implant to maintain its presence on the system.
   - **Step 4**: Given the implant's capabilities and the fact that it communicates with control servers, it is plausible that it would engage in discovery activities, including fetching specific system information.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The question essentially asks if the sequence of ensuring persistence and then engaging in discovery activities (like fetching computer and user name information) after communicating with control servers is likely. Given the capabilities of the Rising Sun implant and the typical behavior of such malware, it is reasonable to assume that after establishing a foothold (persistence) and communicating with control servers, the implant would proceed with gathering more specific information about the compromised system as part of its operational cycle.

**Final Answer: A**
