To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are security flaws in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
   - The exploit leads to the download and installation of an installer package (.msi) that drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).
   - **Execution** involves the backdoor installer dropping several files, including a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and using BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe, which is then used for DLL hijacking to launch dllhost.exe.
   - A malicious DLL backdoor is injected into dllhost.exe.
   - **Persistence** and **Command and Control** involve the backdoor loading an encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and using SSL to connect to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing an installer package with malicious payloads using Equation Editor exploits, Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention RegAsm.exe in the sequence of actions taken by Tropic Trooper after the initial access and execution phases.
   - The report details the use of UserInstall.exe, BITSadmin, sidebar.exe, and dllhost.exe in the execution and persistence phases but does not include RegAsm.exe.
   - The question specifically asks about the dropping of RegAsm.exe before the injection of a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, a step not described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a specific sequence of events following the initial exploit, focusing on the use of an installer package, a backdoor installer, and various system and malicious files to establish persistence and command and control.
   - There is no mention of RegAsm.exe in this sequence, which suggests it is not a part of the described attack methodology.
   - Given the detailed description of the attack sequence and the absence of RegAsm.exe from this sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that Tropic Trooper is not likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

Final Answer: B
