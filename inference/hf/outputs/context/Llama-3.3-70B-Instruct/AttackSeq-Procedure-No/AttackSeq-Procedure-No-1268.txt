To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence by the 'Evil Corp' group aiming to deploy WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Using SocGholish on compromised websites to initiate the attack.
     2. **Initial Access**: Delivering SocGholish via compromised websites, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript.
     3. **Execution**: Deploying Cobalt Strike to download and execute a loader containing a .NET injector.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Using techniques involving slui.exe and wmic.exe.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Disabling Windows Defender and stopping services before launching WastedLocker.
     6. **Credential Access**: Using Cobalt Strike for credential dumping.
     7. **Lateral Movement**: Using Cobalt Strike Beacon for movement and command execution.
     8. **Command and Control**: Communicating with a C&C domain.
     9. **Impact**: Encrypting computers and servers, demanding ransom.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access, the attackers are likely to enumerate AWS infrastructure (like EC2 instances) for discovery.
   - The answer choices are A: Yes, or B: No.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the attack sequence focusing on the deployment of WastedLocker ransomware, emphasizing actions taken within the compromised network, such as privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, and lateral movement.
   - The report does not specifically mention enumeration of AWS infrastructure like EC2 instances as part of the attack sequence.
   - However, the attackers' use of Cobalt Strike for discovery-related PowerShell scripts and their ability to move laterally within the network suggest a capability for extensive network exploration.
   - Enumerating cloud infrastructure could be a plausible step for attackers aiming to understand the full scope of their access and potential targets for ransomware deployment, especially in environments with cloud services integrated into their network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers gain initial access using SocGholish, indicating a sophisticated approach to compromising networks.
   - **Step 2**: The use of Cobalt Strike for various stages of the attack, including discovery and lateral movement, shows the attackers' capability for network exploration.
   - **Step 3**: While the report does not explicitly mention AWS or cloud infrastructure enumeration, the attackers' methods suggest they could be interested in all potential targets within a network, which might include cloud services.
   - **Step 4**: Given the attackers' sophistication and the goal of maximizing the impact of the ransomware, it's reasonable to consider that they might attempt to discover and compromise all accessible systems, including those in the cloud.

**Final Answer: A**
