To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events described, focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the threat actor.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: The threat actor used a phishing email to gain initial access, leading to the deployment of a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Execution**: A CARBANAK RAT was installed, and a PowerShell RAT was deployed for further control.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: The actor escalated privileges and used tools like RunPsExec to install additional malware.
   - **Discovery**: The actor conducted reconnaissance using Cobalt Strike.
   - **Collection**: Data was exfiltrated using the SmartFTP Client.
   - **Command and Control**: Communication was established with Command-and-Control servers.
   - **Exfiltration**: Data theft occurred during the third stage of the attack.

2. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack during the Impact phase after data exfiltration, as opposed to deploying RYUK ransomware a week later.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sophisticated attack involving initial access, execution, privilege escalation, discovery, collection, and command and control, culminating in data exfiltration.
   - The question posits two possible outcomes post-exfiltration: a DDoS attack or the deployment of RYUK ransomware.
   - The report does not explicitly mention plans for a DDoS attack but details a sequence of events focused on gaining access, escalating privileges, and exfiltrating data, which is consistent with a ransomware attack preparation.
   - RYUK ransomware is known for being used by threat actors, including those associated with the CARBANAK and Cobalt Strike tools mentioned in the report, as a means to monetize their access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The threat actor's actions, as described, are typical of a ransomware attack campaign, including the use of CARBANAK RAT and Cobalt Strike.
   - The exfiltration of data could be part of a double-extortion tactic, where the threat actor both steals and encrypts data.
   - There is no direct indication in the report that the threat actor planned a DDoS attack as part of their campaign.
   - The deployment of RYUK ransomware a week after the described activities aligns with the observed TTPs and the goal of monetizing the attack through ransom demands.

**Final Answer: B**
