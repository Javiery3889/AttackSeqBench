To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used methods like a weaponized RTF file, archive files with malicious DLLs, and direct delivery of an executable to gain initial access. They exploited the RoyalRoad tool to drop a loader named 'intel.wll', which then downloaded and executed the next stage payload from a C&C server.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was used for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence was achieved through the 'Startup' folder, 'Run' registry key, or by injecting into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used tactics like operating C&C servers within limited daily windows, fileless loading, and frequently changing server infrastructure and loader variants to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The Aria-body backdoor collected detailed system and network information from the victim's machine.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor had capabilities for file and directory management, taking screenshots, searching for files, launching files, and more.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands **only before** the Discovery tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that after the Discovery phase, where the Aria-body backdoor gathers system and network information, the group would likely use the collected information for further actions, which could include sending the data back to their C&C servers.
   - The report mentions that the Aria-body loader contacts C&C servers, which implies communication post-Discovery for potentially sending collected data and receiving further commands.
   - The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for such communication is plausible given the common use of these protocols for C&C communication in many cyber attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Naikon APT group's operations, as described, involve a series of steps including initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, and collection.
   - The Discovery phase is crucial for gathering information that could be used for further malicious activities.
   - Given the nature of the Aria-body backdoor's capabilities, including contacting C&C servers, it is reasonable to infer that the group would use protocols like HTTP and TCP for communication purposes.
   - However, the question's phrasing ("only before the Discovery tactic") suggests a limitation to the timing of this communication that is not directly supported by the report. The report implies ongoing communication for various purposes, including after the Discovery phase.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible interpretation of the question and the information provided in the CTI report suggests that the Naikon APT group's use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for commands is not limited to only before the Discovery tactic. The group's activities, as described, would likely involve communication at various stages of their operation, including after the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B**
