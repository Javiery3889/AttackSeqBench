To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events described, focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Involves phishing and possibly watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader executes the new Korplug variant by exploiting a side-loading vulnerability, decrypting the Korplug file in memory, and making it executable.
   - **Persistence:** Korplug establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory, copying necessary files, and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry to run at boot.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques throughout the deployment process.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects system information, including uptime, Windows version, locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including file attributes and content.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, before collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The report does not explicitly state the sequence of the initial handshake (whether it's over HTTPS or TCP) before data collection. However, it does mention that data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages, implying communication with C&C servers.
   - The critical point is determining if this communication happens before data collection. The report outlines a sequence where after establishing persistence, the malware proceeds to collect system information (Discovery) and then collects data (Collection), followed by exfiltration.
   - The question seems to imply a specific sequence where communication with C&C servers happens before data collection, but the report does not explicitly confirm this sequence regarding the timing of the initial handshake.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Korplug variant's primary goal is to collect and exfiltrate data.
   - The malware establishes persistence and then proceeds to collect system information and data.
   - Exfiltration occurs via a custom TCP-based protocol, which implies communication with C&C servers.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that the initial communication with C&C servers (via the custom TCP-based protocol) occurs before data collection, only that exfiltration (which involves communication) happens after data collection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided and focusing on the explicit sequences described, the report does not directly support the claim that the initial communication with C&C servers (in the context of the custom protocol for exfiltration) happens before data collection. Thus, based on the explicit sequences provided, the answer to whether the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol before it collects data, as the question frames it, would be "No" because the explicit sequence of events described in the report does not confirm the initial communication happening before data collection in the manner the question suggests.

Final Answer: B
