To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the Lazarus group's attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB), focusing on the execution of malicious software, establishment of persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - Key points include:
     - Deployment of a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) for persistence and antivirus evasion.
     - Use of a 'Polyglot' file to hide and execute malware.
     - Utilization of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control, packed with Themida for evasion.
     - Lateral movement through hardcoded user accounts and IP addresses.
     - Establishment of command and control communication for remote command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after deploying Hermes ransomware and leaving ransom notes, it is likely that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to establish command and control communication for task execution.
   - The question implies a sequence where ransomware deployment is followed by the establishment of command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not directly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or the use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm for file encryption. However, it does discuss the use of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control purposes.
   - The report indicates that the backdoor malware was used to communicate with command and control servers, poll for tasks, and execute remote commands.
   - Given the context, the question seems to introduce new information (Hermes ransomware deployment) not covered in the CTI report but asks about the use of backdoor malware for command and control, which is consistent with the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the main elements of the question - the deployment of Hermes ransomware and the use of backdoor malware for command and control.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the CTI report does not mention Hermes ransomware but does detail the use of backdoor malware for command and control purposes.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of the Lazarus group using backdoor malware for command and control after a ransomware deployment, based on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described in the report.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that, given the Lazarus group's methods, including the use of backdoor malware for command and control as described in the report, it is plausible they would use such malware for these purposes even in the context of a ransomware attack.

**Final Answer: A**
