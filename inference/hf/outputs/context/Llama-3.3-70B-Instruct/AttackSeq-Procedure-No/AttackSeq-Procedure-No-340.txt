To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses a financially motivated threat group, FIN1, using a bootkit named Nemesis for persistent targeting of payment card data.
   - Nemesis infects the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), allowing it to execute before the Windows operating system boots, making detection and removal challenging.
   - The malware remains even after an operating system reinstallation.
   - The Nemesis malware ecosystem includes backdoors for command and control (CnC) with various capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the Nemesis bootkit is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
   - This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the Nemesis bootkit and its ecosystem.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report highlights the sophisticated nature of the Nemesis bootkit, including its ability to infect the VBR and remain persistent even after an OS reinstallation.
   - It mentions the malware's capabilities, such as file transfer and process injection, which could potentially be used to place files in various locations on the system.
   - However, the specific tactic of placing install files into directories excluded from scanning to evade detection is not directly mentioned in the report.
   - Given the bootkit's design to operate at a low level (infecting the VBR) and its persistence mechanisms, it's plausible that additional evasion techniques, such as avoiding detection by placing files in excluded directories, could be part of its arsenal or the broader TTPs of FIN1.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the Nemesis bootkit's primary method of persistence and evasion (infecting the VBR).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the capabilities of the Nemesis malware ecosystem, including file transfer and process manipulation.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of evasion techniques used by sophisticated malware to avoid detection.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of the malware using additional evasion techniques, such as placing files in directories excluded from scanning, given its sophisticated design and the threat actor's continual updates and adaptations.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophisticated nature of the Nemesis bootkit and the threat actor's (FIN1) demonstrated ability to update and adapt their tools, it is plausible that the malware could employ additional evasion techniques, including placing install files in directories excluded from scanning to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
