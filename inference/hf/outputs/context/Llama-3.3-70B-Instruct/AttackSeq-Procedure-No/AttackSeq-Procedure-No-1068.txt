To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Yellow Garuda's activities, including their use of macro-enabled template files for initial access, persistence through replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template, and defense evasion techniques such as using RC4-encrypted strings.
   - It mentions their history of credential harvesting and the use of a Telegram 'grabber' tool to exfiltrate information from victims' Telegram accounts.
   - The report highlights the collection of messages, media, group memberships, and contact data, which are stored in a SQLite database and in JSON format.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after collecting data from Telegram accounts, Yellow Garuda is likely to divide these data into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrate them to evade detection.
   - The question focuses on the exfiltration method used by Yellow Garuda after data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention dividing data into fixed-size chunks for exfiltration.
   - However, it does discuss the use of a Telegram 'grabber' tool for data collection and storage in specific formats (SQLite database and JSON).
   - The report emphasizes Yellow Garuda's efforts in defense evasion, such as using encrypted strings and remote staging of infection chain parts, indicating a sophisticated approach to avoiding detection.
   - Given the threat actor's demonstrated capability in evasion techniques, it's plausible they would employ methods to evade detection during data exfiltration, such as dividing data into fixed-size chunks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the question, which is to understand the exfiltration method used by Yellow Garuda after collecting Telegram data.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report does not directly address the exfiltration method in question, it does highlight Yellow Garuda's sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of evasion techniques and the likelihood of employing similar methods for exfiltration to avoid detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Yellow Garuda's demonstrated sophistication in evasion and the importance of stealth during exfiltration, it is reasonable to infer they might use techniques like dividing data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection, even though the report does not explicitly state this.

Final Answer: A
