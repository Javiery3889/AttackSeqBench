To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions the use of legitimate tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement across a compromised network.
   - It highlights the use of these tools for moving laterally, implying that initial access has already been gained.
   - There's no direct mention of how initial access was gained, but the question provides this context as spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the installation of a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor or the specific actions of mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of installing a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor after gaining initial access via spearphishing.
   - It specifies a sequence of actions: gaining initial access, installing a backdoor, mapping the network, and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report focuses on lateral movement techniques using specific tools but does not detail the initial stages of the attack or the specific method of obtaining domain administrator privileges.
   - The question fills in these gaps by suggesting an initial access method (spearphishing) and a subsequent action (installing a modified Dropbear SSH client as a backdoor).
   - Installing a backdoor like a modified Dropbear SSH client would facilitate remote access and could be a plausible step after initial access, especially if the attackers aim to maintain access and move laterally, as described in the report.
   - Mapping the network and collecting passwords are actions that could follow the installation of a backdoor, as they would help in identifying targets for lateral movement and in obtaining the necessary credentials for domain administrator privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report provides context on lateral movement techniques.
   - The question suggests a specific sequence of actions post-initial access.
   - Given that the installation of a backdoor would logically precede or coincide with efforts to map the network and collect passwords (as these actions require some level of access and control), and considering the report's focus on lateral movement which implies previous steps have been taken to gain and maintain access, the sequence proposed in the question seems plausible.
   - Therefore, considering the information provided and the logical flow of a cyber attack, the answer to whether it is likely that the attackers will install a modified Dropbear SSH client as the backdoor before mapping the network and collecting passwords is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
