To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infects systems through social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's to install itself.
   - **Persistence:** It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
   - **Credential Access:** CosmicDuke steals credentials from various software and Windows.
   - **Discovery:** It searches for specific file types on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for data exfiltration and updates.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exfiltrating data, CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer as part of CosmicDuke's capabilities after exfiltration.
   - It does mention that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns and targets non-English filenames, indicating a focus on document and data collection rather than the specific actions of keylogging, screenshotting, or clipboard stealing.
   - The report highlights CosmicDuke's ability to steal credentials and export certificates, which aligns more with the actions described in the "Credential Access" and "Discovery" sections rather than the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a specific sequence of actions (using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltration and under certain conditions) that is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI report.
   - The report focuses on CosmicDuke's methods of initial access, execution, persistence, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration, without detailing the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer in the context provided by the question.
   - Given the information in the report, it seems that CosmicDuke's primary actions are centered around stealing credentials, discovering and exfiltrating specific data types, and maintaining persistence and command and control, rather than the specific surveillance actions mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: B**
