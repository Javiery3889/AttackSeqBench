To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a Cosmic Banker attack targeting Mexican banking institutions.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Identifying targets.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gained through a phishing email with a malicious attachment.
     3. **Execution**: A batch script executes a PowerShell script that downloads malware.
     4. **Persistence**: Malware achieves persistence through startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Malware is protected with VMProtect packer.
     6. **Credential Access**: Malware steals bank credentials and accesses Outlook for email accounts.
     7. **Collection**: Malware sends collected email accounts to cyber actors via a POST web request.
     8. **Command and Control**: Communication with specified domains for downloading malware and sending data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts, the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves **Collection** and potentially **Exfiltration**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report specifies that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts and then sends them to the cyber actors through a **POST web request**.
   - There is no mention of exfiltration over FTP in the report. Instead, the method of sending collected data is specified as a POST web request, not FTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report clearly states that collected email accounts are sent to cyber actors via a POST web request, not over FTP.
   - The question asks about exfiltration over FTP, which is not mentioned in the report as a method used by the malware.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, the correct answer is that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

Final Answer: B
