To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: CosmicDuke infections start with victims opening malicious PDF files containing exploits or disguised executables, using social engineering and document-based exploits.
   - **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, with updates over time.
   - **Persistence**: CosmicDuke achieves persistence through scheduled tasks and a Windows service.
   - **Credential Access**: It steals various credentials and sensitive information.
   - **Discovery**: Searches for specific file types and patterns.
   - **Collection**: Uses keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing to collect information.
   - **Exfiltration**: Uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access and execution, CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report clearly states that CosmicDuke uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP for exfiltration.
   - However, the report does not mention WebDav as a method for communication or updating.
   - The sequence of events in the report suggests that after initial access and execution, CosmicDuke would engage in activities like persistence, credential access, discovery, and then collection of information through keylogging, screenshotting, etc.
   - The exfiltration of information via FTP happens after the collection of information, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question inaccurately suggests that communication with remote servers for exfiltration and updating happens before the collection of information, which contradicts the sequence of events described in the report.
   - The report specifies FTP as the method for exfiltration but does not mention WebDav.
   - Therefore, the correct sequence based on the report is that CosmicDuke collects information and then exfiltrates it via FTP, not that it communicates with remote servers before collecting information.

**Final Answer: B**
