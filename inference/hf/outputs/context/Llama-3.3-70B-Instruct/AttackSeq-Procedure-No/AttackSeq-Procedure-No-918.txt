To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Gamaredon group's tactics, starting from Initial Access via spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - Execution involves scripting and launching malicious DLLs.
   - Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, and inserting malicious macros into documents.
   - Defense Evasion includes obfuscation, modifying registry keys, and code signing.
   - Discovery involves listing interesting files for future exfiltration.
   - Lateral Movement is facilitated by injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macros.
   - Command and Control uses HTTP and HTTPS.
   - Exfiltration involves uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after inserting malicious macros and using a backdoor for discovery, Gamaredon's malware would capture passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention anything about prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window for capturing passwords.
   - The report focuses on Windows-based tactics, such as using VBScript, Batch files, and exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, indicating a primary focus on Windows systems rather than macOS.
   - The tactics described (e.g., injecting macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros) are specific to Windows and Microsoft Office applications, not macOS.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary operating system targeted by Gamaredon based on the CTI report. The report indicates a focus on Windows systems, given the mention of specific Windows and Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the tactic of prompting for "macOS needs to access System Settings" aligns with the known tactics of Gamaredon. This tactic seems unrelated to the Windows-focused methods described.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the possibility of Gamaredon adapting tactics to target macOS systems. While possible, the CTI report does not provide evidence of this, focusing instead on Windows-specific methods.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is unlikely that Gamaredon's malware would capture passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window, as this does not align with their described tactics and focus on Windows systems.

Final Answer: B
