To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report outlines a campaign by Charming Kitten that involved several phases, including Resource Development, Initial Access, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Command and Control.
   - **Resource Development:** Involved creating fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to extract credentials. These were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation in Bulgaria.
   - **Initial Access:** The campaign started with socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists, followed by redirecting victims to decoy websites.
   - **Credential Access:** Specifically mentions the creation of phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services to steal credentials, which seems to be part of the campaign's second stage.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after targeting non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists (which is part of the Initial Access phase), Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials only during the Resource Development phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The report indicates that the creation of fake websites for credential theft (impersonating Google services and Instagram) is mentioned under both Resource Development and Credential Access. However, the context suggests that these activities are not strictly confined to the Resource Development phase but are integral to the overall campaign, including the Initial Access and Credential Access phases.
   - The Initial Access phase involves redirecting victims to decoy websites, which implies that the creation and use of these fake websites are crucial for gaining initial access and subsequently for credential access.
   - The question seems to imply a strict sequence or limitation of activities to specific phases, which might not fully align with the fluid nature of cyber attack campaigns where phases can overlap or where resources developed in one phase are used in another.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The creation of fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram is a key tactic used by Charming Kitten.
   - These websites are used for credential theft, which is a critical aspect of the campaign.
   - While the report mentions these activities under Resource Development, their use is not limited to this phase alone; they are integral to the campaign's success, particularly in Initial Access and Credential Access phases.
   - Given the nature of cyber campaigns, where phases can overlap, and the fact that the report discusses the use of these fake websites in the context of gaining access and stealing credentials, it suggests that the creation and use of these websites are not confined to a single phase like Resource Development.

**Final Answer: B**
