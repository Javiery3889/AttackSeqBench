To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack where the initial access is gained through spearphishing emails with attachments disguised as PDF documents but actually containing Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware.
   - The report mentions the discovery of several Command and Control (C&C) servers associated with the post-leak Hacking Team spyware samples, indicating the spyware's ability to communicate with these servers for command and control purposes.
   - The "Others" section provides context about the development and distribution of the spyware but does not directly relate to the technical details of the attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after gaining initial access via spearphishing emails with spyware, it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.
   - The question focuses on a specific tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) involving the use of a hidden file system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system in the %TEMP% directory.
   - The report details the initial access vector (spearphishing with malicious attachments) and the communication with C&C servers but does not specify the intermediate steps or the specific TTPs used by the spyware after initial access and before establishing C&C communication.
   - Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence in the report to confirm the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method described in the report, which is through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report does not detail the specific actions taken by the spyware between initial access and communication with C&C servers.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the question posits a specific TTP (using a portable FAT16 partition image in %TEMP%) not explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not provide information to directly support the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system, we must conclude based on the information given.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific information in the CTI report about the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system before establishing communication with C&C servers, the most appropriate answer based on the provided details is that it is not explicitly supported by the report.

Final Answer: B
