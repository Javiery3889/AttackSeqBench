To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks, with filenames related to current events used to deliver a downloader.
   - The campaign utilizes a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate executable.
   - The loader decrypts the encrypted Korplug file in memory, makes the buffer executable, and then calls into it.
   - Persistence is established by creating a hidden directory, copying necessary files, and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry.
   - The Korplug variant collects system information, retrieves system locale, hostname, and IP addresses, and communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after delivering a downloader and gaining initial access, Mustang Panda is likely to deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.
   - The key elements here are the deployment of LoJax and the use of control-flow obfuscation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention the deployment of a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax at any stage of the attack.
   - It does mention the use of anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage of the deployment process, which is a method used for defense evasion.
   - The report focuses on the use of a custom loader, Korplug variant, and its activities such as persistence, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method described in the report, which involves phishing and watering hole attacks to deliver a downloader.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report does not mention the deployment of LoJax, a UEFI rootkit, in the attack sequence.
   - **Step 3**: Note that control-flow obfuscation is indeed used but as part of the broader strategy of anti-analysis techniques, not specifically in conjunction with LoJax.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not mention LoJax and focuses on the Korplug variant and its activities, it's unlikely that LoJax deployment is a part of this described campaign.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no indication that Mustang Panda deploys a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion in this campaign.

Final Answer: B
