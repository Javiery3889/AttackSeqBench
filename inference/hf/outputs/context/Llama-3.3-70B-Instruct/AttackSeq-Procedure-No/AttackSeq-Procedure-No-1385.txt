To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FIN13.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
   - **Persistence**: They use methods like replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware (SIXPACK and SWEARJAR) for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: FIN13 uses techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials with Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion**: They employ tactics such as using passive backdoors and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access**: Techniques include process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing.
   - **Discovery**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI to execute commands remotely and move laterally.
   - **Collection**: Data is collected from network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control**: FIN13 uses proxies and protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated over web services.

2. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution, FIN13 would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - According to the CTI report, FIN13 uses passive backdoors (like BLUEAGAVE) and custom malware for extended periods within victim environments. This suggests that these tools are used after initial access has been gained, potentially for persistence and command and control rather than initial access.
   - The report indicates that exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware is a method used for **initial access**.
   - The use of SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries is mentioned under **persistence**, indicating these are methods used after initial access has been established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - FIN13 first gains **initial access** through exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - After gaining access, they establish **persistence** using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - The employment of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE is part of their strategy for **persistence** and **command and control**, not for gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that FIN13 would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access **after** using other methods to establish persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
