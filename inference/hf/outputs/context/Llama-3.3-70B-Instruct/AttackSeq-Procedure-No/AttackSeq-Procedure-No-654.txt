To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
   - The actors then use the webshell for **Execution** of commands, including system and user discovery, and upload various tools like Mimikatz and Impacket's wmiexec and atexec tools.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are employed using a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access** is achieved by dumping credentials from memory using Mimikatz and employing pass-the-hash techniques with Impacket tools.
   - **Lateral Movement** is facilitated by using the webshells, dumping credentials, and utilizing Impacket's atexec tool to run commands on other systems.
   - **Command and Control** is maintained through the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after dumping credentials and performing pass-the-hash, it's likely the actors will retrieve metadata for files on disk or obtain file and directory listings before moving laterally using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool.
   - The key actions in question are related to **Credential Access** and **Lateral Movement** tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that after gaining credentials, the actors used them to move laterally. However, it does not explicitly state whether they retrieved file metadata or directory listings before doing so.
   - Given the context, the actors' goal is to expand their access within the network. Retrieving metadata or directory listings could be part of their reconnaissance to identify valuable targets or to understand the network layout better before moving laterally.
   - The use of tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash and lateral movement suggests a sophisticated approach that likely includes reconnaissance steps to maximize the effectiveness of their lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the actors after obtaining credentials, which is to move laterally within the network.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the typical actions taken during lateral movement, which often include reconnaissance to identify potential targets.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of retrieving metadata or directory listings as part of this reconnaissance.
   - **Step 4**: Given the sophistication of the tools and techniques used, it is reasonable to assume that such reconnaissance steps would be included to facilitate more effective lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A**
