To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Operation Sharpshooter, which starts with reconnaissance by masquerading as job recruitment activity.
   - Initial access is gained through malicious documents containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader, leading to the Rising Sun implant.
   - Execution involves the shellcode acting as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant, which resolves libraries, downloads payloads, and executes them.
   - Persistence is achieved by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - Discovery (reconnaissance) involves fetching network and system information.
   - Exfiltration uses RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding before sending data via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after performing initial reconnaissance, the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by the Rising Sun implant after it has gathered information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
   - There is no mention of using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication in the provided CTI report.
   - The report specifies the use of HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, which implies a direct communication method rather than leveraging third-party platforms like blogs and WordPress.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of exfiltration and communication mentioned in the CTI report, which is via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if there's any mention of using blogs and WordPress for communication, which is not present in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the typical methods of communication used by implants for C2, which often involve direct connections or indirect methods like DNS tunneling, but the report specifically mentions HTTP POST requests.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report, there is no indication that the Rising Sun implant uses blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication with its C2 server. The specified method of communication is via HTTP POST requests, making the use of blogs and WordPress unlikely based on the provided details.

Final Answer: B
