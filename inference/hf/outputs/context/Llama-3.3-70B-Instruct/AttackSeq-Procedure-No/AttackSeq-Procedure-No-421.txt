To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - The sequence of events as per the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails are sent with attached Word documents.
     2. **Execution**: Upon opening the document, a VBS macro executes, leading to the retrieval and execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
     4. **Command and Control**: The script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads.
     5. **Impact**: The downloaded payloads include GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the campaign executes VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the execution of VBS macros from a Word document as a means to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the campaign involves phishing emails with Word documents containing macros, which, when opened, execute to download and run malware.
   - The report details that the VBS macro in the Word document is a critical step in executing the PowerShell script, which then downloads the actual malware payloads.
   - Given this information, it is clear that the execution of VBS macros from the Word document is a primary method for gaining initial access to the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial vector of attack, which is phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the role of VBS macros in executing PowerShell scripts to download malware.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the question is asking if the execution of VBS macros is a likely step before gaining initial access.
   - **Step 4**: Based on the report, the execution of VBS macros is a confirmed step in the attack sequence that leads to the download and execution of malware, thus facilitating initial access.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the observed campaign involves the execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document as a means to gain initial access.

Final Answer: A
