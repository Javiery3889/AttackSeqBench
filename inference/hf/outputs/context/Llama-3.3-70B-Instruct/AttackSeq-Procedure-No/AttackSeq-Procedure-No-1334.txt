To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the OceanLotus Group in Operation Cobalt Kitty.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Initial Access (through spear-phishing)
     4. Execution (using PowerShell and fileless payloads)
     5. Persistence (via Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks)
     6. Privilege Escalation (using Mimikatz for credential dumping)
     7. Defense Evasion (exploiting DLL hijacking and using DNS Tunneling)
     8. Credential Access (harvesting credentials with Mimikatz)
     9. Discovery (performing lateral movement)
     10. Lateral Movement (using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools)
     11. Exfiltration (using a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook)

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the OceanLotus Group will use DNS over HTTPS for command-and-control communication before performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows built-in tools.
   - The key elements here are the use of DNS over HTTPS for command-and-control and the performance of lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the OceanLotus Group used DNS Tunneling as a command-and-control communication method to overcome network filtering solutions. However, it does not specifically mention the use of DNS over HTTPS.
   - The report does detail the group's ability to adapt and evolve their techniques, suggesting they might adopt new methods like DNS over HTTPS if beneficial for their operations.
   - Lateral movement using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools is explicitly mentioned in the report as part of the group's tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary methods of command-and-control communication mentioned in the report. The report specifies DNS Tunneling but does not mention DNS over HTTPS.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the group's adaptability and evolution of tactics. Given their sophistication and continuous adaptation, it's plausible they could adopt DNS over HTTPS if it serves their purposes.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood based on the provided information. While the report does not directly mention DNS over HTTPS, the group's use of DNS Tunneling and their adaptability suggest they might use any effective method for command-and-control, including potentially DNS over HTTPS, especially if it helps in evading detection.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the final answer based on the analysis. Given the group's sophistication and the fact that DNS over HTTPS is a method that could be used for command-and-control communication, it's reasonable to consider that they might use it, especially since the question is about likelihood and potential future actions rather than past observed behavior.

**Final Answer: A**
