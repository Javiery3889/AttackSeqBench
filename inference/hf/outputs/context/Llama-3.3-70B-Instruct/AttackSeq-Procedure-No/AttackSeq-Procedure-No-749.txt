To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Reconnaissance**, where the attackers masquerade as legitimate job recruitment activity to gather information.
   - **Initial Access** is gained through malicious documents containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader, which retrieves the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Execution** involves the shellcode executing the Rising Sun implant, which downloads and executes a second-stage payload.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by the implant downloading its binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery** involves the Rising Sun implant performing initial reconnaissance, gathering system and network information.
   - **Command and Control** communications are established using HTTP POST requests with RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after performing initial reconnaissance and using RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration, the Rising Sun implant would likely communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - The key elements here are the use of RC4 encryption, Base64 encoding, and HTTP POST requests for communication with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with the data being encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - This matches the scenario described in the question, where after performing reconnaissance, the implant would use these methods for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the communication method used by the Rising Sun implant as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Compare this method with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the implant's communication method aligns with the question's details about encryption, obfuscation, and the use of HTTP POST requests.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the CTI report and the question describe the same method of communication (HTTP POST requests with RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding), it is logical to conclude that the implant would indeed communicate with control servers in this manner after performing initial reconnaissance.

Final Answer: A
