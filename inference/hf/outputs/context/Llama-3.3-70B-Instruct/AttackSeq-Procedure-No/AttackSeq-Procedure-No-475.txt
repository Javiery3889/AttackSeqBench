To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Infamous Chisel, a malware collection targeting Android devices, associated with Sandworm activity.
   - Key points from the report relevant to the question include:
     - **Persistence**: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd system binary and executes as root.
     - **Exfiltration**: The malware's netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after replacing the legitimate netd service, Infamous Chisel will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - The question directly references the **Exfiltration** tactic mentioned in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that after replacing the legitimate netd service, Infamous Chisel's netd component is capable of automatically exfiltrating files.
   - This capability is specifically mentioned to occur at regular intervals and utilizes a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for the exfiltration process.
   - Therefore, the information provided in the CTI report directly supports the notion that after impacting the system, Infamous Chisel will indeed automatically exfiltrate files as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key tactics mentioned in the CTI report related to the question, which are Persistence and Exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the replacement of the legitimate netd service is a method of persistence that allows the malware to execute with root privileges.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the exfiltration capability is a direct consequence of the malware's design and its ability to persist on the system as described.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that based on the information provided in the CTI report, the most plausible sequence of events includes the automatic exfiltration of files after the malware has established persistence.

Final Answer: A
