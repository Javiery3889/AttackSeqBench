To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's initial access methods, including the use of zero-day exploits and backdoor Trojans.
   - It mentions the discovery of Longhorn's operations through a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document, which infected a target with Plexor malware.
   - The malware is designed for espionage, with capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration, indicating a focus on gathering information from the compromised systems.
   - The report also highlights Longhorn's operational security measures to remain undetected, including custom cryptographic protocols for communication with C&C servers and randomization of communication intervals.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after infecting a target with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit, Longhorn's tools are likely to perform system fingerprinting and discovery before following guidelines to avoid detection.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by Longhorn after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we understand that Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage and has detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
   - Given that the primary goal of Longhorn's operations is espionage, it is logical that after gaining initial access, they would utilize these capabilities to gather as much information as possible about the compromised system.
   - The report also emphasizes Longhorn's focus on operational security, suggesting that they take measures to avoid detection, which aligns with the idea of performing system fingerprinting and discovery in a manner that minimizes the risk of being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Longhorn infects a target using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document, which is a method of initial access.
   - **Step 2**: Given the espionage focus of Longhorn's malware, it is reasonable to assume that after initial access, the malware would be used to gather information about the system.
   - **Step 3**: System fingerprinting and discovery are essential for understanding the layout and vulnerabilities of the compromised system, which would be a logical next step after infection.
   - **Step 4**: Considering Longhorn's emphasis on operational security, these actions would likely be taken in a way that follows guidelines to avoid detection, such as using custom cryptographic protocols and randomizing communication intervals.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the nature of Longhorn's operations, it is likely that after infecting a target, Longhorn's tools would perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities as part of their espionage-focused efforts, and they would do so in a manner that attempts to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A
