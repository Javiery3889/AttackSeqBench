To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the IEXPL0RE RAT's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Delivered via email attachments with social engineering.
     2. **Execution**: Installs a custom-generated launcher program that unpacks and runs the RAT in memory.
     3. **Persistence**: Establishes persistence through installing binaries, startup links, and leaving traces in the %temp% folder.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs custom launchers, multi-stage unpacking, and memory-only execution to evade detection.
     5. **Collection**: Records keystrokes, sends data back to the command and control (C2) server, and can download files and install additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after collecting data, the IEXPL0RE RAT is likely to use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure. However, it highlights the RAT's capability for data exfiltration and communication with its C2 server, mentioning that it sends collected data back to the server at regular intervals.
   - The report emphasizes the RAT's use of custom and evasive techniques for its operations, including a multi-stage unpacking process and memory-only execution to avoid detection.
   - The question about using blogs and WordPress as part of the C2 infrastructure introduces a specific tactic that is not directly addressed in the report. However, the report's focus on the RAT's ability to communicate with its C2 server for data exfiltration and to receive further instructions suggests a preference for methods that are likely to be stealthy and reliable.
   - Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are common techniques used for C2 communication due to their ability to blend in with normal web traffic, making them less suspicious and thus more likely to be used for such purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The IEXPL0RE RAT's primary goal is to collect sensitive information from the target systems, including keystrokes and passwords.
   - **Step 2**: For exfiltrating this data and receiving further instructions, the RAT would likely use methods that are both stealthy and reliable.
   - **Step 3**: While the report does not explicitly mention the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure, it does imply a need for covert communication channels.
   - **Step 4**: Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are well-suited for covert C2 communication due to their common use in legitimate web traffic, making them less likely to arouse suspicion.
   - **Step 5**: Given the RAT's sophisticated evasion techniques and the need for reliable, covert communication, using blogs and WordPress (which could potentially be more detectable or less reliable for consistent C2 communication) seems less likely compared to utilizing encrypted HTTP methods.

**Final Answer: B**
