To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - These macros execute a PowerShell script that operates in memory, avoiding detection.
   - The script downloads and executes payloads, including GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware, from hardcoded command and control (C2) servers.
   - The sequence of events based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing campaign setup.
     2. **Initial Access**: Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: PowerShell script operates in memory.
     4. **Command and Control**: Communication with C2 servers to download payloads.
     5. **Impact**: Execution of GandCrab and Ursnif malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access, it's likely that an encoded PowerShell script will execute before being retrieved via a VBS macro and then download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves the execution of a PowerShell script (via a VBS macro) and the subsequent download of malware payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the PowerShell script is executed by the macro embedded in the Word document.
   - The script then downloads and executes the malware payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) from C2 servers.
   - The question essentially asks if this sequence of events is plausible based on the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The report confirms that the initial access vector is phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - **Step 2**: These macros execute a PowerShell script, which is a plausible and documented technique in the report.
   - **Step 3**: The PowerShell script operates in memory and communicates with C2 servers to download payloads, aligning with the report's description of defense evasion and command and control techniques.
   - **Step 4**: The payloads downloaded include Ursnif and GandCrab malware, which matches the impact phase described in the report.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is indeed likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute (after being retrieved via a VBS macro) and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Final Answer: A
