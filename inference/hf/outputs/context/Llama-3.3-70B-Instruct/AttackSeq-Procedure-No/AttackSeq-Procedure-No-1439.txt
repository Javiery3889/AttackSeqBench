To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The StellarParticle campaign used SSH, RDP, and VPNs to gain access, leveraging previously stolen credentials and port forwarding.
   - **Persistence:** They used credential hopping, accounts with Delegated Administrator rights, and configured malware (TrailBlazer for WMI persistence and GoldMax via crontab) for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Techniques included stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA, using renamed utilities, and renaming systems to blend in.
   - **Discovery:** Utilized tools like AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather information from Active Directory and other systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Used RDP with both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
   - **Collection:** Accessed data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using web session cookies for credential access to cloud resources, it's likely that the StellarParticle campaign would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The report indicates that the StellarParticle campaign used various techniques for persistence, including credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence. It also mentions defense evasion techniques, including stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA, which implies they have an interest in accessing and utilizing session cookies for their advantage.
   - The question posits a specific sequence of actions: using web session cookies, then stealing more cookies after credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence. The report does not explicitly state this sequence but does show that the campaign is capable of and interested in both stealing cookies and using various persistence and evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The StellarParticle campaign has demonstrated the ability and intent to steal and utilize web session cookies as part of their defense evasion techniques.
   - They have also shown proficiency in credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence, which are sophisticated tactics indicating a deep understanding of the network and its vulnerabilities.
   - Given their interest in maintaining access and evading detection, it's plausible they would continue to steal web session cookies at various stages of their campaign, including after establishing persistence and during lateral movement.
   - However, the question's specificity about the sequence (stealing cookies only after credential hopping and configuring malware) is not directly supported by the report. The campaign's actions suggest a more fluid and opportunistic approach to stealing cookies and using them for access.

**Final Answer: B**
