To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that starts with **Initial Access** via a watering hole attack, exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
   - The **Execution** phase involves a multi-stage infection process, including the exploitation of CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation and the execution of a backdoor named SLUB.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by the SLUB backdoor through copying itself and creating a Run registry key.
   - **Privilege Escalation** is mentioned as part of the execution phase, exploiting CVE-2015-1701.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics are used to avoid detection by security software.
   - **Discovery** involves the SLUB backdoor downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands.
   - **Command and Control** is established through Slack, with the backdoor posting messages and command results to a private Slack channel.
   - **Exfiltration** methods include uploading files to file.io and posting download links to Slack.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the SLUB backdoor supports various commands for data collection, it is likely to perform discovery by downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute, specifically looking for lines starting with '^' and ending with '$'.
   - This matches the scenario described in the question, where the backdoor is involved in data collection activities and then performs discovery by downloading and parsing a GitHub 'gist' snippet.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report details the SLUB backdoor's capabilities, including its method of performing discovery.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the SLUB backdoor performing discovery in a specific way after supporting data collection commands.
   - The report confirms that the SLUB backdoor does indeed download and parse a GitHub 'gist' snippet as part of its discovery process.
   - Therefore, given the information in the CTI report, it is likely that the SLUB backdoor would perform discovery in this manner after supporting various commands for data collection.

Final Answer: A
