To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The FHAPPI campaign starts with an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware is a VBScript encoded script that downloads a .doc file, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy.
   - The PowerShell command executes base64 encoded code, which downloads and executes a .ps1 file containing more base64 encoded code for infection.
   - The malware communicates with a C2 server at IP address 61.97.243.15.
   - The campaign involves file-based malware (VBScript, .doc file, .ps1 file) and uses PowerShell for execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads from URLs, the FHAPPI campaign would likely utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing a connection with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the use of files (VBScript, .doc, .ps1) in the initial stages of the attack, indicating a file-based approach.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute base64 encoded code is a technique that can be associated with both file-based and fileless malware, as it can be used to execute code in memory without writing it to disk.
   - However, the report specifically mentions the download and execution of files (.doc, .ps1) as part of the infection process, suggesting that the initial stages of the attack are not fileless.
   - The question of whether the campaign would utilize fileless techniques "only after establishing connection with the C2 server" implies a shift in tactics post-establishment of C2 communication. The report does not explicitly state that the campaign switches to fileless techniques after C2 establishment but highlights the use of PowerShell, which can facilitate fileless execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The FHAPPI campaign's initial infection vector involves files, indicating a file-based approach.
   - The use of PowerShell for executing encoded commands can support fileless techniques, but the report emphasizes the download and execution of specific files as part of the attack.
   - There is no explicit indication in the report that the campaign shifts to fileless techniques after establishing C2 communication.
   - Given the emphasis on file-based malware in the initial stages and the lack of explicit mention of a switch to fileless techniques post-C2 establishment, the most plausible answer based on the information provided is that the campaign's described behavior does not necessarily imply a shift to fileless techniques solely after C2 connection.

Final Answer: B
