To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where the initial access is gained through a malicious installer named 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Through the malicious installer.
     2. **Execution**: Begins with sysCrt32.exe, which ensures persistence and executes various batch files.
     3. **Persistence**: Established by adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable and setting up scheduled tasks.
     4. **Credential Access**: libchrome.exe queries Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords.
     5. **Command and Control**: The C2 servers are used to download and execute the second stage of the spyware.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Handled by sysUp32.bat, which collects files created by the components and uploads them to the FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after extracting Chrome passwords, the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves Credential Access followed by potential data collection and exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that after Credential Access (extracting Chrome passwords), the spyware has components like libCache32.exe for keylogging and libTemp32.exe, which could imply collection of additional data.
   - However, the report specifically mentions the exfiltration of Chrome passwords, crypto-wallet data, and files created by the components but does not explicitly mention the collection of data from USB drives or screen images.
   - The report does mention keylogging (which involves collecting keystrokes) as part of the execution process, performed by libCache32.exe.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The spyware is capable of collecting various types of data, including keystrokes (through keylogging).
   - There is no explicit mention of collecting data from USB drives or screen images in the provided CTI report.
   - Given the information provided, the most accurate answer based on the details in the CTI report would be that the spyware does collect additional data (like keystrokes) but there's no clear indication of collecting data from USB drives or screen images as part of its standard operation.
   - Therefore, without explicit mention of collecting data from USB drives or screen images, but knowing it collects keystrokes, the answer leans towards the spyware having the capability to collect additional data types but not all specified in the question.

Final Answer: B
