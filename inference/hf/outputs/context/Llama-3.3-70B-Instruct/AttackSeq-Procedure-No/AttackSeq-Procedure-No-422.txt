To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents containing macros.
   - These macros execute a PowerShell script that downloads and executes Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The techniques used include operating in memory to evade detection and using hardcoded C2 servers for communication.
   - The impact includes file encryption by GandCrab and credential harvesting by Ursnif.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after initial access through phishing emails.
   - The question implies a potential next step in the attack sequence after the initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not directly mention exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 or targeting FortiOS devices.
   - The report focuses on the initial access through phishing emails and the subsequent execution of malware.
   - Exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2018-13379 would be a separate action, potentially part of a broader campaign but not directly described in the provided report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial attack vector described in the CTI report, which is phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the actions taken after the initial compromise, including the execution of PowerShell scripts and the downloading of malware.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the question's implication of a subsequent action (exploiting CVE-2018-13379) and evaluate if it aligns with the information provided in the report.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not mention the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 or specifically targeting FortiOS devices, and given that the question asks for a likelihood based on the observed campaign, we must conclude based on the information provided.
   - **Conclusion**: The CTI report does not provide direct evidence or imply that the campaign involves exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access. Therefore, based on the information given, it's not directly supported by the report.

Final Answer: B
