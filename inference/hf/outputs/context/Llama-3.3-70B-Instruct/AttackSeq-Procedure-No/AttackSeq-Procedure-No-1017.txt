To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the BlackEnergy APT group targeting Ukraine.
   - The attack vector involves a malicious Microsoft Word document that drops the BlackEnergy Trojan if macros are enabled.
   - Upon execution, the payload drops a DLL file as "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT" and ensures persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.
   - The final payload connects to a C&C server.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Through a malicious Word document with macros.
   - Execution: Enabling macros leads to the execution of "vba_macro.exe", which drops the BlackEnergy dropper.
   - Persistence: The dropper ensures execution on every system startup by creating a LNK file.
   - Impact: Focus on destructive actions, compromising installations, and espionage.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after connecting to the C&C server and issuing an HTTP POST request, the BlackEnergy Trojan will ensure persistence by creating a LNK file to execute a specific command on every system boot.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that after the payload is executed, it drops a DLL file and ensures persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder, which executes "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on every system boot.
   - The question essentially describes a step (connecting to the C&C server) that is part of the attack sequence but not directly mentioned in the persistence mechanism description. However, given the context, connecting to the C&C server is an action that would occur after the initial infection and before or as part of establishing persistence.
   - The key detail is that the report confirms the creation of a LNK file for persistence, which matches the action described in the question.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The BlackEnergy Trojan's behavior, as described, includes ensuring persistence.
   - The method of persistence involves creating a LNK file in the startup folder.
   - The question's scenario, involving connection to a C&C server, is part of the post-exploitation activities that would precede or accompany the establishment of persistence.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that after connecting to its C&C server, the BlackEnergy Trojan would indeed ensure persistence by the described method.

**Final Answer: A**
