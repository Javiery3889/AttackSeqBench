To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the initial access methods used by threat actors, including spear-phishing emails and strategic web compromises to deliver the Poison Ivy server code.
   - Execution involves the Poison Ivy server being delivered as mobile code and executed on the target's endpoint, allowing attackers to gain control of the system.
   - Persistence is achieved through a watchdog thread injected into explorer.exe if the persistence option is enabled.
   - Defense evasion is facilitated by encrypting network communications with the Camellia cipher and potentially blending in with normal network activity, especially over port 443.
   - The report does not specifically mention the use of Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing the Poison Ivy server, it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for C2 communications with the attacker's client.
   - The question focuses on the Command and Control phase, which involves how the malware communicates with the attacker's command and control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the execution and communication methods of the Poison Ivy malware but does not explicitly mention the use of Google Drive for C2 communications.
   - The report highlights that Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted and may use port 443 for SSL-encrypted web traffic to blend in with normal network activity, but it does not specify the use of cloud services like Google Drive for C2.
   - Given the information provided, there's no direct indication that Google Drive is a typical or preferred method for C2 communications in the context of Poison Ivy infections described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on the initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion tactics related to Poison Ivy.
   - It discusses the encryption and potential methods used for C2 communications but does not mention Google Drive.
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of using Google Drive for C2 communications, which is not supported by the information provided in the report.
   - Therefore, based on the information given and the typical behaviors of Poison Ivy as described, it is unlikely that the malware would use Google Drive for C2 communications as a standard or preferred method.

Final Answer: B
