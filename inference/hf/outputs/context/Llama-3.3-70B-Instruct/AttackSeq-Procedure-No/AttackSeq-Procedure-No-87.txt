To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Vyveva backdoor, attributed to the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Execution (T1569.002, T1106)
     - Persistence (T1543.003)
     - Defense Evasion (T1140, T1070.006, T1036.004, T1112, T1027)
     - Discovery (T1083, T1057, T1082, T1016, T1124)
     - Command and Control (T1573.001, T1573.002)
     - Exfiltration (T1041)
   - The report highlights that Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), list running processes, obtain system information, get the local IP address (T1016), and system time and time zone (T1124), and it can exfiltrate data to the C&C server (T1041).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after performing certain discovery actions (obtaining file and directory listings, getting the local IP address, and retrieving system time and time zone), Vyveva's backdoor is likely to exfiltrate files to the C&C server only before compressing them.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence and specifics of Vyveva's exfiltration behavior.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention that Vyveva compresses files before exfiltration. It does mention that Vyveva can exfiltrate data to its C&C server (T1041) and that it encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001), but compression is not specified as a step in the exfiltration process.
   - Given the information provided, the question's assumption about compression before exfiltration is not supported by the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the relevant TTPs from the report related to the question, which are file and directory listings (T1083), obtaining the local IP address (T1016), system time and time zone (T1124), and exfiltration (T1041).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report does not mention file compression as part of the exfiltration process.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report does not specify compression as a necessary step before exfiltration and given that the question's premise includes an action (compression before exfiltration) not detailed in the report, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is that it is not explicitly stated that Vyveva will exfiltrate files only after compressing them.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the answer that aligns best with the provided details is that there is no indication that compression is a required step before exfiltration, making the premise of the question (exfiltration only after compression) not directly supported by the report.

Final Answer: B
