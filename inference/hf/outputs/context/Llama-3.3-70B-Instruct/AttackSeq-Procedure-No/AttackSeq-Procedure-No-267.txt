To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - **Initial Access**: Involves phishing and watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution**: Utilizes a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant, which decrypts the encrypted Korplug file in memory.
   - **Persistence**: Establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Features heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery**: Collects extensive system information.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with encryption using RC4.
   - **Exfiltration**: Performs data exfiltration via the same custom protocol used for C&C, involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives.
   - The key elements here are the sequence of actions: collecting data from local systems and removable media, and then the method of data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the Korplug variant collects system information and can communicate with C&C servers for command and control, as well as for data exfiltration, using a custom TCP-based protocol with encryption.
   - The question implies a specific sequence of actions (collecting data and then exfiltrating it), focusing on whether exfiltration happens before gathering data from network shared drives.
   - The report does not explicitly state the order of operations regarding data collection from network shared drives versus exfiltration. However, it does describe the malware's capability for data exfiltration after it has established communication with the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Korplug malware is designed to collect system information and establish communication with C&C servers.
   - Data exfiltration is a capability of the malware, using the same custom TCP-based protocol as for C&C communication.
   - The question's implication that data exfiltration occurs after collecting metadata and content but before gathering data from network shared drives is not directly supported or refuted by the report's description of the malware's capabilities.
   - However, given the malware's design for stealth and efficiency, it's plausible that data exfiltration could occur at various stages of the infection, including after initial data collection and before further network exploration.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the information provided and the analysis, the most plausible answer, considering typical malware behavior and the capabilities described, would lean towards the malware being capable of exfiltrating data as it collects it, including potentially before it gathers data from network shared drives. However, the report does not explicitly confirm this sequence, and malware behavior can vary based on its programming and the goals of its operators.

Final Answer: B
