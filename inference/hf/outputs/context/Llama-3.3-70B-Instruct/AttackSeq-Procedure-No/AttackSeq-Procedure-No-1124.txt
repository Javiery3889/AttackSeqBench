To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government.
   - The attack exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The exploit is hosted on specific domains and resolves to a Ukrainian IP, likely through DNS hijacking.
   - The Flash exploit ('show.swf') executes shellcode to install a payload retrieved from the same domains.
   - The payload is embedded in a GIF image (b.gif).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via the Adobe Flash exploit, it is likely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload from the GIF image.
   - The question focuses on the actions taken by the Flash file after the initial exploit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 to execute shellcode for installing a payload.
   - It mentions the use of ActionScript classes for exploiting the vulnerability and installing the payload but does not explicitly mention downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes.
   - The report's focus is on the exploit mechanism, payload retrieval, and installation, without discussing NTLM downgrading or hash capture.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence - The attack starts with a spear-phishing email leading to the exploitation of CVE-2015-5119.
   - **Step 2**: Identify the role of ‘show.swf’ - It executes shellcode to install a payload, not explicitly mentioning NTLM downgrading.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of NTLM downgrading - This action is typically associated with credential access tactics, which are not the primary focus of the described exploit.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood based on the report - The report does not provide direct evidence or imply that NTLM downgrading is part of the exploit's functionality.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, there is no explicit mention or implication that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ downgrades NTLM to capture NTLM hashes as part of its actions after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: B
