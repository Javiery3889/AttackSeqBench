To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes MuddyWater's attack vectors for initial access, which include:
     1. Exploiting CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office vulnerability, through decoy documents.
     2. Communicating with compromised C2 (Command and Control) servers to download files infected with macros.
   - The report explicitly mentions that MuddyWater uses these methods for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after hosting malicious code as part of their Command and Control operations, MuddyWater is likely to use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access.
   - The key elements here are the use of compromised C2 servers and the download of macro-infected files as a method for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that MuddyWater does indeed use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros as one of their initial access vectors.
   - The question essentially asks if this behavior is consistent with MuddyWater's tactics after they have established a presence (implied by "hosting malicious code as part of their Command and Control operations").
   - Given that the report directly states this as one of their methods for initial access, it aligns with the tactics described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify MuddyWater's initial access vectors from the report, which include exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability and communicating with compromised C2 servers to download macro-infected files.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the question is asking about the likelihood of MuddyWater using compromised C2 servers for downloading macro-infected files as part of their initial access tactics.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the report directly supports the use of compromised C2 servers for downloading macro-infected files as an initial access method.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, MuddyWater is indeed likely to use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access, as this is explicitly mentioned as one of their tactics.

Final Answer: A
