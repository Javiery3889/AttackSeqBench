To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the activities of Buckeye (APT3), a threat actor group.
   - **Initial Access**: Buckeye uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to download and execute Backdoor.Pirpi.
   - **Defense Evasion**: They modify tools to evade detection and use Backdoor.Pirpi for network presence and information gathering.
   - **Credential Access**: Buckeye gathers credentials using a keylogger, ChromePass, and Lazagne.
   - The report does not explicitly mention stealing emails from Microsoft Exchange servers but highlights credential gathering and network information collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gathering credentials, Buckeye is likely to steal emails from Microsoft Exchange servers during the collection phase.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where credential access is followed by potential data collection, such as email theft.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details Buckeye's interest in gathering credentials and network information, which could be used for further exploitation, such as accessing sensitive data.
   - While the report does not specifically mention stealing emails from Microsoft Exchange servers, the group's interest in network information and credential gathering suggests they could use these credentials for accessing sensitive data, potentially including emails.
   - The use of Backdoor.Pirpi for maintaining network presence and collecting information supports the possibility of further data collection activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Buckeye's primary goal, as indicated by their use of spear-phishing and credential-gathering tools, is to gain access to sensitive information within a network.
   - **Step 2**: The group's employment of tools like ChromePass and Lazagne for credential access suggests an interest in exploiting gathered credentials for deeper network access.
   - **Step 3**: Given the nature of their operations and the tools used, it is plausible that Buckeye would attempt to use gathered credentials to access sensitive data, which could include emails from Microsoft Exchange servers, especially if these servers are part of the targeted network.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the tactics and techniques described, it is reasonable to infer that Buckeye could use the gathered credentials to steal emails from Microsoft Exchange servers as part of their data collection efforts.

Final Answer: A
