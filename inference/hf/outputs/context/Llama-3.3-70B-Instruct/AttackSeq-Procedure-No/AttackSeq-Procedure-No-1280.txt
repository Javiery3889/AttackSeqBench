To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT10, a Chinese cyber espionage group, using DLL Side-Loading for initial access.
   - The tactics used for initial access, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control are detailed.
   - Key points for initial access include the use of DLL Side-Loading to inject shellcode into svchost.exe.
   - For persistence, APT10 used either a service installation with various service names or the Run registry key under the name 'Windows Updata'.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after using DLL Side-Loading for initial access, APT10 is likely to connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence.
   - The question focuses on the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT10, specifically whether connecting to the IPC$ share is part of their method before achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention APT10 connecting to the IPC$ share on remote machines as part of their attack sequence.
   - The report details the use of DLL Side-Loading for initial access and then describes persistence methods (via services or the Run registry key) without mentioning any interaction with the IPC$ share.
   - Connecting to the IPC$ share is a technique that could be used for lateral movement or to establish a foothold within a network, but the report does not specify this action in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by APT10, which is DLL Side-Loading.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the persistence methods used by APT10, which are installing as a service or using the Run registry key.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate if connecting to the IPC$ share is mentioned or implied as a necessary step before establishing persistence. The report does not mention this step.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the typical use of connecting to the IPC$ share in the context of cyber attacks, which often involves lateral movement or establishing a network foothold, but recognize it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report, there is no explicit mention of APT10 connecting to the IPC$ share as part of their attack sequence before establishing persistence. Therefore, based on the details given, it is not indicated that this is a likely step in their process.

Final Answer: B
