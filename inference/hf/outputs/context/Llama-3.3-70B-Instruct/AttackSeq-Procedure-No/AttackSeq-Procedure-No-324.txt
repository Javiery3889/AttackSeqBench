To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access**, where iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that runs in the background, collects information, and has the ability to restart itself on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase is characterized by the malware's ability to collect various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after collecting information during the **Discovery** phase, it is likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the **Command and Control** phase.
   - The question essentially asks us to infer the next step in the attack sequence based on the information provided.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for downloading additional components or data as part of the Command and Control phase.
   - However, the report does indicate that the malware is capable of collecting and presumably sending back various types of data, which could imply some form of command and control communication.
   - The use of FTP for downloading files or updates is a common tactic in many malware campaigns, as it allows for the dynamic updating of malware capabilities or the exfiltration of collected data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence described - Initial Access, Execution, and Discovery.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question pertains to the Command and Control phase, which follows the Discovery phase in the attack sequence.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities of the malware as described - it collects various data, which implies a need for exfiltration or further instruction.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of FTP being used for downloading as part of Command and Control, given the malware's advanced capabilities and the common use of FTP in similar contexts.
   - **Conclusion**: While the report does not explicitly mention FTP, the nature of the malware and common practices in malware operations suggest that initiating a download via FTP could be a plausible next step for command and control purposes, especially for exfiltrating collected data or updating the malware.

Final Answer: A
