To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report provided.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca, a threat actor, in various phases of a cyber attack. These phases include Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.
   - **Reconnaissance**: Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information about user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access**: They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers to gain initial access.
   - **Execution**: They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence**: Various techniques were used to maintain access, including account manipulation and creating services.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques like abusing elevation control mechanisms were used to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion**: They used several methods to avoid detection, including abuse of elevation control mechanisms and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Discovery**: Scanning tools were used to discover machines in the compromised network environment.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Exploiting remote services and internal spear phishing were used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection**: Data was collected from local systems, network shared drives, email, and screen captures.
   - **Command and Control**: Various protocols and techniques were used for command and control, including encrypted channels and proxies.
   - **Exfiltration**: Data was exfiltrated by compressing files and uploading them to cloud accounts or using C2 channels.

2. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after exploiting remote services for lateral movement, Earth Lusca would target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz only after scanning for machines in the target's network environment.
   - The tools mentioned (procdump and Mimikatz) are typically used for credential dumping, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, not explicitly listed in the report but implied through actions like privilege escalation and lateral movement.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The report indicates that after gaining initial access and executing malicious code, Earth Lusca engaged in various activities to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.
   - The use of tools like procdump and Mimikatz for credential dumping would logically follow the exploitation of remote services for lateral movement, as having credentials would facilitate further movement and access within the network.
   - The scanning for machines in the network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is part of the **Discovery** phase, which could happen before, during, or after lateral movement, depending on the group's objectives and the network's layout.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Earth Lusca's actions indicate a pattern of exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining access, escalating privileges, and then moving laterally within the network.
   - Credential dumping using tools like procdump and Mimikatz would be a logical step after gaining access to systems and before or during lateral movement to facilitate unhindered access to other parts of the network.
   - Scanning the network environment is a discovery tactic that could be used at various stages of the attack to identify potential targets for lateral movement or to understand the network topology.

**Final Answer: B**
