To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors use compromised legitimate websites to host their malware, in addition to spear-phishing with attachments, to increase the odds of successful infiltration.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Updates to the malware include changes in configuration storage, command handling, and introducing large file sizes to avoid antivirus scanning. The malware is also recompiled without changes to avoid detection based on PE header hashes.
   - **Command and Control:** The Emissary Trojan communicates with C2 servers using HTTP requests, with three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names.
   - **Others:** Provides context about the evolution of the Emissary Trojan, its capabilities, and its targets.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Emissary Trojan would compromise legitimate websites to host its malware for initial access **only after** achieving persistence by writing itself to %SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report indicates that compromising legitimate websites is a method used for **initial access**, not a step that occurs after achieving persistence.
   - Achieving persistence, such as writing itself to %SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service, would be a step that occurs **after** initial access has been gained, as part of the **Persistence** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The question seems to reverse the order of operations as described in the CTI report, suggesting that compromising websites happens after persistence, which contradicts the typical attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that compromising legitimate websites is a tactic used for initial access.
   - Persistence mechanisms, like modifying system files or installing as a service, occur after the initial access has been achieved.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Emissary Trojan would compromise legitimate websites to host its malware **only after** achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
