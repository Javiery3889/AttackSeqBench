To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers. This indicates the first step in their attack was to compromise the SharePoint servers.

2. **Execution**: After gaining access, they uploaded a variety of tools, including legitimate applications and post-exploitation tools like Mimikatz, as well as custom backdoors such as HyperBro. This step shows that after initial access, they focused on executing their tools to further their objectives within the compromised network.

3. **Persistence**: The installation of webshells on SharePoint servers was for persistence, indicating an effort to maintain access over time.

4. **Defense Evasion**: They used webshells for DLL sideloading and other evasion techniques, showing an attempt to avoid detection.

5. **Credential Access**: Tools like Mimikatz were used to dump credentials, facilitating further movement within the network.

6. **Discovery**: Network reconnaissance was performed to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.

7. **Lateral Movement**: They moved laterally using stolen credentials and by exploiting vulnerabilities, specifically mentioning CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).

8. **Command and Control**: The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control communications.

Given this sequence, the question asks if, after scanning the network for vulnerable systems (specifically targeting CVE-2017-0144), it is likely that Emissary Panda uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, only after exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.

The correct sequence based on the report is:
- Initial access through CVE-2019-0604 exploitation.
- Installation of webshells for persistence.
- Execution of various tools, including custom backdoors like HyperBro.
- Further actions like credential access, discovery, lateral movement (which includes exploiting CVE-2017-0144), and command and control.

The question seems to imply a specific order that might not directly align with the detailed sequence provided in the report. However, it's clear that the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 was the initial step, followed by the installation of webshells, and then the execution of various tools including HyperBro. The scanning for vulnerable systems (e.g., using CVE-2017-0144) would logically occur after initial access and the deployment of tools necessary for network reconnaissance and lateral movement.

Therefore, considering the sequence of events:
- The initial access was through CVE-2019-0604.
- The upload of tools and custom backdoors like HyperBro occurred after gaining initial access.
- The scanning and exploitation of other vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144 were part of the lateral movement phase.

Given this analysis, the answer to whether it is likely they uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors only after exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability to gain initial access is affirmative because the report indicates that the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 was the initial step, followed by the deployment of various tools and backdoors as part of their execution and persistence tactics.

Final Answer: A
