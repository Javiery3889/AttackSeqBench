To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign targeting Instagram users, especially influencers, through phishing messages impersonating technical support or friends.
   - The phishing messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges to lure victims into providing their credentials on fake Instagram login pages.
   - After compromising the accounts, the attackers demand ransom for their return but do not restore access even after payment. Instead, they continue to use the accounts for scams and sell their hacking services.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram messages impersonating technical support or friends.
   - Execution: Victims are tricked into providing credentials on phishing sites.
   - Impact: Accounts are compromised, and attackers demand ransom, use accounts for further scams, and sell hacking services.

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after delivering phishing messages, the attackers would likely lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that the attackers compromise accounts by tricking victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites.
   - It implies that once the attackers have the credentials, they can access and control the accounts, which includes the capability to change passwords and lock out the original owners.
   - The question suggests a sequence where the attackers change passwords (to lock out owners) before using phishing sites. However, the report suggests that the phishing sites are used to obtain the credentials in the first place.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first use phishing messages to trick victims into providing their credentials on fake login pages.
   - Once the attackers have these credentials, they can access the accounts.
   - Changing the account passwords would be a step to secure their access and lock out the original owners, which aligns with the behavior of demanding ransom for account return and continuing to use the accounts for malicious purposes.
   - However, the specific sequence in the question about using phishing sites after changing passwords to collect credentials seems to misrepresent the order of events based on the report. The phishing sites are used to initially collect credentials, not after changing passwords.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Given the information in the report, it's plausible that attackers change passwords to lock out original owners after obtaining credentials through phishing. However, the question's framing about using phishing sites after changing passwords to collect credentials does not accurately reflect the attack sequence described.

**Final Answer: B**
