To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: A suspicious email with a Word document containing a macro dropper was sent. The macro was designed to execute a JavaScript payload.
     2. **Execution**: The Word document's VBA-Macro functions ('AutoOpen' and 'HeadrFooterProperty') decoded a JavaScript payload, which was obfuscated and used a XOR key to decode a third JavaScript stage.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: The attacker used obfuscation techniques in the VBA-Macro and the JavaScript payload to hinder analysis.
   - The report mentions the final JavaScript downloader dropping a file from a specified URL into the system's temporary directory and executing it, but it does not specify the name of the file or details about revealing source code or visitor tracking.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after utilizing obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory, it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL only before 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
     1. Using obfuscated VBA-Macro to decode JavaScript payloads.
     2. Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory.
     3. The specific action of dropping 'nanagrams.exe' before 'surprise.php' reveals its source code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not specifically mention 'nanagrams.exe' or 'surprise.php', nor does it discuss the revelation of source code or visitor tracking through an iframe as part of the attack sequence.
   - The report does indicate that the final JavaScript downloader is designed to drop a file from a specified URL into the system's temporary directory and execute it, which aligns with the first part of the question but does not provide details about the conditions (like revealing source code or visitor tracking) mentioned in the question.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, there's no direct evidence to support the specific scenario described in the question, including the file name 'nanagrams.exe' and the condition related to 'surprise.php'.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides details on the attack sequence involving obfuscated VBA-Macro functions and a JavaScript downloader dropping a file into the system's temporary directory.
   - The question introduces specific details ('nanagrams.exe' and the condition related to 'surprise.php') not found in the CTI report.
   - Without explicit information in the CTI report supporting the specific scenario described in the question, the most logical conclusion is that the question's scenario is not directly supported by the provided CTI report.
   - Therefore, based on the information given and the steps outlined, the answer to whether it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' under the conditions described is not supported by the CTI report.

Final Answer: B
