To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The initial access involves a malicious Microsoft Word document with encrypted script data and an external template containing VBA macros.
   - The VBA code decrypts embedded data, dropping two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).
   - The report mentions the use of PowerShell scripts but does not explicitly discuss the use of a COM object for executing queries to gather system information before downloading components for the malware payload.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document, it is likely that a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before a PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a COM object and the sequence of gathering system information followed by downloading a zip file, which are not directly mentioned in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the initial access method and the execution of PowerShell scripts ('fmx.ps1') but does not explicitly mention the use of a COM object for gathering system information.
   - The report does discuss the execution of PowerShell scripts and the use of encoded data, which could potentially be used for gathering system information or downloading additional components, but it does not specify the use of a COM object for these purposes.
   - Given the information in the report, the direct answer to whether a COM object is used in the manner described in the question is not explicitly stated. However, the report focuses on the use of VBA macros, PowerShell scripts, and encoded data for payload delivery and execution, without mentioning COM objects as part of this process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on the initial access and execution methods used by the Bandook campaign, emphasizing the role of VBA macros and PowerShell scripts.
   - The question introduces the concept of using a COM object for gathering system information before downloading malware components, which is not directly addressed in the report.
   - Given the information provided in the CTI report, there is no explicit mention of using a COM object for the described purpose, making it less likely that this is a part of the attack sequence as described.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the most plausible answer, given the details are not explicitly mentioned in the report, would lean towards the option that does not assume additional, unmentioned steps in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: B
