To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Dexphot attack, focusing on its execution and persistence stages.
   - Key points from the execution stage include:
     - Writing five key files to disk.
     - Loading executables into system processes via process hollowing.
     - Targeting legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, and others.
   - From the persistence stage:
     - Dexphot ensured persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks.
     - It used techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using fileless techniques for defense evasion, Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.
   - The question implies a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) where fileless techniques are used first for evasion, followed by process hollowing for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report directly mentions that Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during its execution stage.
   - Although the report does not explicitly state the use of "fileless techniques" as a precursor to process hollowing, it does describe a complex execution stage involving writing files to disk and then using process hollowing.
   - The question's reference to "fileless techniques" might be slightly misleading since the report highlights the writing of files to disk. However, the core action of interest is the use of process hollowing for loading executables into legitimate processes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the execution techniques used by Dexphot. The report clearly states that Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into system processes.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the question's context about fileless techniques. While the report does not explicitly discuss fileless techniques as a defense evasion method before process hollowing, the focus is on whether Dexphot uses process hollowing after evasion techniques.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided. Given that Dexphot does indeed use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes, the question's specifics about the sequence (fileless techniques followed by process hollowing) are less critical than the fact that process hollowing is a confirmed TTP used by Dexphot.
   - **Conclusion**: The report confirms Dexphot's use of process hollowing for loading executables into legitimate system processes, which directly answers the question about the likelihood of this action following any initial evasion techniques.

Final Answer: A
