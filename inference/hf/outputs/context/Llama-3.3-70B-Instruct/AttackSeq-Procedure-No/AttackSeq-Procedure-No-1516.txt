To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where the initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
   - The attackers leverage old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor.
   - The backdoor has capabilities for data collection, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - The backdoor communicates with a C&C server using encrypted communication and is capable of exfiltrating data.
   - There is no mention of the backdoor deploying CaddyWiper or any specific actions related to wiping files or physical drive partitions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the backdoor exfiltrates data, it is likely to deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities and physical drive partitions.
   - CaddyWiper is known as a wiper malware used in attacks to destroy data, but it is not mentioned in the provided CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the capabilities of the backdoor, including data exfiltration, but does not mention any wiper functionality or the deployment of CaddyWiper.
   - The report focuses on the surveillance operation, data collection, and the backdoor's communication with the C&C server, without indicating any intent or capability to wipe data or destroy systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the attack as described in the CTI report, which is surveillance and data collection.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the report mentions any actions or capabilities related to data destruction or the use of wiper malware like CaddyWiper. It does not.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of the backdoor deploying CaddyWiper based on the provided information. Given the focus on data collection and surveillance, and the absence of any mention of data destruction capabilities, it is unlikely that the backdoor would deploy CaddyWiper for such purposes.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no indication that the backdoor installed by the attackers is intended to deploy CaddyWiper or engage in any data wiping activities.

Final Answer: B
