To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the activities of FIN13, a threat actor targeting Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FIN13 include:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks, capturing credentials.
     - **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers, deploying web shells and custom malware.
     - **Execution**: Using JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
     - **Persistence**: Replacing legitimate binaries with trojanized versions, deploying malware.
     - **Privilege Escalation**: Using utilities like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Employing passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities.
     - **Credential Access**: Dumping LSASS process memory, network sniffing, targeting unsecured credentials.
     - **Discovery**: Using native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     - **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells.
     - **Collection**: Collecting data from network shared drives, staging it locally or remotely.
     - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating data over web services.
   - The specific technique mentioned involves calculating a command and control port using parts of an IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention FIN13 using DNS Calculation techniques for command and control port determination.
   - FIN13's methods for command and control, as described, involve the use of web shells, JSPRAT, and other custom tools, but do not specify the use of DNS calculations for determining ports.
   - The report highlights FIN13's use of web services and custom tools for exfiltration but does not detail the use of DNS-based techniques for evasion or command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify FIN13's known TTPs related to command and control and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if DNS Calculation techniques are mentioned or implied in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of FIN13 using such techniques based on their known TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given that the report does not mention DNS Calculation techniques and instead focuses on web shells, custom malware, and other methods for command and control and exfiltration, it is unlikely that FIN13 would use DNS Calculation techniques as described before exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: B
