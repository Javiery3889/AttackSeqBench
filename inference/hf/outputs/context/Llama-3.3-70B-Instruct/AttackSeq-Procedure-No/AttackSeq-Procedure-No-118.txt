To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** The Tuyul botnet executes commands on victim systems using a Perl script with various functionalities.
   - **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It evades detection by using a binary version undetected by antivirus engines and various PHP web shells.
   - **Command and Control:** The botnet uses a specific domain as its C&C server, hosting malware files with a valid SSL certificate.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via CVE-2017-9841, the Tuyul malware will likely leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' for persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services as part of the attack sequence.
   - However, it does mention the use of PHP web shells to gain access to servers, which could imply leveraging existing access or vulnerabilities rather than explicitly stating the use of legitimate credentials.
   - The report clearly states that the malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the initial access method - The question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-9841, which is not detailed in the CTI report but is a known vulnerability in PHPUnit.
   - **Step 2:** Determine the likelihood of leveraging legitimate credentials - The report does not explicitly mention this step, focusing more on the execution, persistence, and command and control aspects.
   - **Step 3:** Analyze the persistence method - The report clearly states that the malware downloads a 'cron' bash script for persistence, which aligns with part of the question.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the information provided, the question's focus on leveraging legitimate credentials before downloading the 'cron' script for persistence introduces a step (using legitimate credentials for external remote services) not explicitly covered in the CTI report. However, the report does detail the use of web shells and other methods for access, which might imply some form of credential or access exploitation. The critical detail from the report relevant to the question is the periodic download of the 'cron' script for persistence, which is a confirmed action of the malware.

**Final Answer: A**
