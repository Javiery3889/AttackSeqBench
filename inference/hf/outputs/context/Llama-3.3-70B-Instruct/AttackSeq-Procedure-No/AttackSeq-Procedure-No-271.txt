To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Execution involves a custom loader exploiting a side-loading vulnerability to load the Korplug variant.
   - Persistence is established through creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - The campaign features heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - The Korplug variant collects system information, retrieves system locale, hostname, and IP addresses, and collects data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - Command and Control communication is done using a custom TCP-based protocol with encryption.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, it is likely for the Korplug variant to perform data discovery on the system.
   - The question specifically mentions collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives as an example of data discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the Korplug variant is capable of collecting extensive information about the system and data from various sources, including local systems, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - The report explicitly mentions that Korplug can list files and directories along with their attributes and content and collects metadata and content from all mapped drives, which aligns with the data discovery activities mentioned in the question.
   - Given that the Korplug variant is designed to collect and exfiltrate data, and considering its capabilities as described in the report, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing communication with its C&C servers, it would indeed perform data discovery on the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Korplug variant's primary function, as described, involves data collection and exfiltration.
   - The variant's ability to collect system information, list files and directories, and gather metadata and content from all mapped drives directly supports the notion that it performs data discovery.
   - The use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages, further indicates the variant's capability and intent to handle and transmit sensitive data.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Korplug variant would perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, as part of its operational cycle.

Final Answer: A
