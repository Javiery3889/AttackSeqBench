To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack starts with an ISO file download containing malicious scripts.
   - Execution involves various VBScripts and batch files, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - Persistence is achieved through 'stopedge.bat' scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists.
   - Discovery and Collection are performed by 'versioninfo.bat', which gathers system information and prepares it for exfiltration.
   - Command and Control (C2) communication is facilitated by 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat'.
   - Exfiltration is carried out by 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' using 'unactivate.vbs'.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that after 'versioninfo.bat' collects information, a UEFI rootkit like LoJax would manage the deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report details the execution of various scripts and batch files for different purposes, including exfiltration and persistence.
   - It mentions file management, such as scheduling and potential deletion, in the context of 'stopedge.bat'.
   - However, the report does not specifically mention the use of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax for managing or deleting files to evade detection.
   - The primary methods of evasion and persistence described involve scripting and batch files, not rootkits.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence and techniques used by the Konni APT Group as described.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while file management and evasion techniques are discussed, the specific use of a UEFI rootkit for file deletion is not mentioned.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the question, which introduces a UEFI rootkit like LoJax as a method for evading detection by deleting specific files.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood based on the provided information. The report focuses on scripts and batch files for attack execution, persistence, and exfiltration, without mentioning rootkits.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, there's no direct evidence to suggest the use of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax for managing file deletion to evade detection. The described tactics focus on scripting and batch files for these purposes.

Final Answer: B
