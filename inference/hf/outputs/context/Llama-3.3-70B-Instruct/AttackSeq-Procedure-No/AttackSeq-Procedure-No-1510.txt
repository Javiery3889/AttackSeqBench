To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Carbanak group's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting data on banking applications and internal procedures.
     2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing with malicious URLs and documents to download a Cobalt Strike beacon.
     3. **Execution**: Downloading and executing new payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files.
     4. **Persistence**: Establishing a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Finding admin-level credentials to move across the infrastructure.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Minimizing detection by operating outside business hours and limiting system interactions.
     7. **Discovery**: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network.
     8. **Lateral Movement**: Compromising workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
     9. **Collection**: Collecting documents for exfiltration.
     10. **Command and Control**: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon for communication with compromised systems.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Preparing documents for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Carbanak group conducted LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions the use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for discovery and mapping the organization's internal network, as well as collecting administrative-level credentials.
   - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks are techniques that could be used for network discovery and credential collection, which aligns with the goals of the **Discovery** and **Lateral Movement** phases described in the report.
   - However, the report does not explicitly mention LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks. Instead, it highlights the use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for these purposes.
   - Given the information provided, it's plausible that the Carbanak group could have used various techniques for network discovery and credential collection, but the report specifically mentions the Cobalt Strike beacon as the tool used for these activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sophisticated attack involving reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of using specific techniques (LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks) for network mapping and credential collection.
   - While these techniques are plausible in the context of the attack phases described, the report specifically mentions the use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for similar purposes.
   - Given the information provided in the report and the question, the most direct answer based on the details given would lean towards the techniques not being explicitly mentioned, but the goals of those techniques (network discovery and credential collection) are achieved through the Cobalt Strike beacon.

Final Answer: B
