To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack using the Vyveva backdoor by the Lazarus group.
   - The tactics and techniques used include:
     - **Execution**: Via a service (T1569.002) and using CreateProcessA API (T1106).
     - **Persistence**: Creating a new service for the loader (T1543.003).
     - **Defense Evasion**: Decrypting strings and components (T1140), timestomping files (T1070.006), masquerading tasks or services (T1036.004), modifying the registry (T1112), and using encrypted strings and components (T1027).
     - **Discovery**: Obtaining file and directory listings (T1083), listing running processes (T1057), obtaining system information (T1082), local IP address (T1016), and system time and time zone (T1124).
     - **Collection**: Compressing files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002), collecting files (T1005), and notifying C&C about removable media (T1025).
     - **Command and Control**: Encrypting C&C traffic with XOR (T1573.001), communicating via Tor (T1573.002), and exfiltrating data (T1041).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after compressing files with zlib during the Collection tactic, Vyveva is likely to divide files if their size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic.
   - The question focuses on the behavior of Vyveva after file compression, specifically regarding file size and exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that Vyveva can compress files with zlib before sending them to the C&C server (T1560.002) as part of the Collection tactic.
   - It also mentions exfiltrating data to the C&C server (T1041) as part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that Vyveva divides files based on size (0x1000000 bytes or more) during exfiltration.
   - Given the capabilities described, such as compressing files and exfiltrating data, it's plausible that Vyveva could handle large files, but the specific behavior of dividing files based on size is not directly mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the relevant tactics and techniques from the CTI report related to file handling and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question's focus on file division based on size during exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: Compare the report's information with the question's specifics, noting the lack of explicit mention of file division by size.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the plausible behaviors of Vyveva based on its described capabilities and the context of the question.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, there is no explicit evidence to confirm that Vyveva divides files based on size during exfiltration. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided would be that it is not explicitly stated that Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: B
