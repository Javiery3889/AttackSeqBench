To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence involving iOS malware attributed to Operation Pawn Storm.
   - The sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Initial Access**: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     2. **Execution**: The XAgent app runs in the background, collects various information, and has persistence capabilities on iOS 7 (though limited on iOS 8).
     3. **Discovery**: The app collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, starts voice recording, gets a list of installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the Command and Control phase (which involves sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files), the app will collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question involves Command and Control followed by Discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the malware is capable of collecting various types of information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, etc.) as part of its functionality, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - The question posits a scenario where after the Command and Control phase, the app proceeds to collect information, which is a repetition of the Discovery phase activities mentioned in the report.
   - Given the malware's design and capabilities as described, it is plausible that after establishing Command and Control, the malware could continue or repeat the collection of information as part of its ongoing operation on the compromised device.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's primary function, as described, involves collecting and exfiltrating sensitive information from the victim's device.
   - The Command and Control phase is about establishing communication and potentially receiving commands or sending stolen data.
   - The Discovery phase, as outlined in the report, involves the collection of specific data types.
   - Given the nature of the malware and its goals, it is reasonable to assume that after any Command and Control activities, the malware would continue to collect information as part of its operational cycle.
   - Therefore, the answer to whether the app will subsequently collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data on the victim's device during the Discovery phase, after the Command and Control phase, is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
