To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses Operation Pawn Storm and focuses on an iOS malware that is part of this operation.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - **Execution**: The XAgent app is a fully functional malware that runs in the background, can hide its icon (on iOS 7), and can restart itself after being terminated (on iOS 7).
   - **Discovery**: The app collects various information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, etc.) and performs several routines on the iOS device.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after collecting information and performing routines, the app is likely to use encryption for its Command and Control (C2) channel before uploading files via FTP protocol.
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by the malware after data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of encryption for the C2 channel or the specifics of how the collected data is transmitted back to the attackers.
   - However, given the advanced nature of the malware (as described in the report) and the common practices of sophisticated threat actors, using encryption for C2 channels is a plausible step to evade detection.
   - The report highlights the malware's ability to collect sensitive information, suggesting that securing the communication channel would be in the interest of the attackers to maintain stealth and protect their operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the capabilities and behaviors of the malware as described.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the importance of secure communication for sophisticated malware to avoid detection.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the typical practices of threat actors in similar contexts, where encryption is often used to protect C2 communications.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the advanced nature of the malware and the common practices among sophisticated threat actors, it is reasonable to infer that the malware would likely use encryption for its C2 channel to securely transmit the collected data.

Final Answer: A
