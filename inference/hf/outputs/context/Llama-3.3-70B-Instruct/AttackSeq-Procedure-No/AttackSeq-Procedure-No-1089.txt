To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193) via an email with a malicious Excel document.
     2. **Execution**: User Execution (T1204) through exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction.
     3. **Credential Access**: Techniques used include Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214).
     4. **Collection**: Data from Local System (T1005).
     5. **Command and Control**: Using Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071).
     6. **Exfiltration**: Data Encrypted (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after stealing stored passwords and access tokens, it is likely that the campaign will employ File Deletion (T1107) as part of defense evasion before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (T1204) happens early in the attack sequence, as part of the execution phase, right after the initial access via spearphishing.
   - The stealing of stored passwords and access tokens (Credential Access) happens after the execution phase, using techniques like T1003, T1081, and T1214.
   - File Deletion (T1107) as a defense evasion technique could potentially be used at various stages of the attack to hide traces of the malware or other malicious activities.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that T1107 would be employed before exploiting CVE-2017-11882, which does not align with the sequence of events described in the CTI report. The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 is an early step in the attack, used for gaining execution, not something that happens after credential access and potential defense evasion techniques like file deletion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a specific sequence of attack tactics.
   - The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 is used for initial execution, not after credential access.
   - Defense evasion techniques like File Deletion (T1107) could be used at various points but asking if it's likely before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 does not fit the described sequence.
   - Therefore, considering the sequence of events and the tactics used, it is not likely that T1107 (File Deletion) would be employed specifically before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 as part of the defense evasion in this context.

Final Answer: B
