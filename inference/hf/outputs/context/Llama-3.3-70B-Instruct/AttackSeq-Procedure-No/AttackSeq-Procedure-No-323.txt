To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** where iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The **Execution** phase involves the XAgent app, which is a fully functional malware that runs in the background, collects information, and has the ability to restart itself on iOS 7 devices.
   - The **Discovery** phase is where the app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after a specific communication method with the Command and Control server (using a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix), the malware is likely to collect certain types of information during the **Discovery** phase.
   - The question specifically mentions collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that during the **Discovery** phase, the malware is designed to collect all kinds of information on an iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - The method of communication with the Command and Control server (using a Base64-encoded token) is not directly linked to the collection of information in the report but suggests a command and control mechanism that could potentially trigger or facilitate the collection of such data.
   - The report does not provide a direct link between the communication method and the data collection activities but implies that the malware's purpose is to gather information, which aligns with the activities mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's primary function, as described, is to collect information from the compromised device.
   - The **Discovery** phase, as outlined in the report, includes the collection of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, among other information.
   - The question's context about communicating with the Command and Control server using a specific method does not contradict the malware's capabilities as described in the report.
   - Therefore, given the malware's design and purpose, it is likely that it would collect such information during the **Discovery** phase.

Final Answer: A
