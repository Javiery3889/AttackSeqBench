To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, with similarities to the MuddyWater campaign.
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents with social engineering tactics to trick victims into enabling macros, which then execute the payload.
   - **Execution**: After execution, the payload creates files in the ProgramData directory, including a .VBS script that executes a PowerShell script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Persistence**: The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The campaigns use obfuscation and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
   - **Discovery** and **Collection**: The backdoor function collects machine information, takes screenshots, and sends this data to a C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing a backdoor function for Discovery and Collection, it is likely that the backdoor will use cloud services (Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive) to host malicious downloads during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of cloud services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for hosting malicious downloads.
   - The report focuses on the initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, and collection tactics but does not detail the specific methods used for command and control beyond communicating with a C&C server.
   - The use of cloud services for malicious activities is a common tactic in many campaigns due to the ease of access and the difficulty in tracking such activities. However, the report does not provide direct evidence or hints towards the use of these specific services for hosting malicious downloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers but does not specifically mention the use of cloud storage services for hosting malicious downloads.
   - Given the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine that the attackers use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for this purpose based solely on the report.
   - The question requires an inference about the Command and Control phase that is not directly supported by the details in the CTI report.
   - Therefore, without explicit information linking the attackers' TTPs to the use of these cloud services for hosting malicious downloads, the most cautious and informed answer would be based on the absence of direct evidence in the report.

Final Answer: B
