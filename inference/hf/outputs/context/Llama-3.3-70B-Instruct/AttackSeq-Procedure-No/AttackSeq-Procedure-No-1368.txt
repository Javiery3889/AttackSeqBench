To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the QuasarRAT backdoor's ability to achieve persistence by installing itself as a service named DILLJUICE in later variants.
   - It mentions the use of several layers of obfuscation and encryption for defense evasion, including the CppHostCLR technique to inject and execute the .NET loader assembly.
   - The report does not mention the use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) for executing commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the QuasarRAT loader is likely to utilize the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to execute commands via Windows DDE.
   - The question specifically mentions the DDE technique, which is not discussed in the provided CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the methods used by QuasarRAT for persistence and defense evasion but does not mention the use of DDE.
   - Given that the report specifies the use of CppHostCLR for injecting and executing the .NET loader assembly, and considering the focus on encryption, obfuscation, and the specific mention of how the backdoor communicates with the C2 server, there's no indication that DDE is part of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by QuasarRAT as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary methods of persistence and execution mentioned in the CTI report, which include installing as a service and using CppHostCLR for injection.
   - **Step 2**: Note the absence of any mention of the DDE technique in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context provided by the report, focusing on the technical details of how QuasarRAT operates.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided and the context of QuasarRAT's TTPs.
   - Given the information and the steps above, the most plausible conclusion is that the use of DDE is not indicated by the CTI report as part of QuasarRAT's TTPs.

Final Answer: B
