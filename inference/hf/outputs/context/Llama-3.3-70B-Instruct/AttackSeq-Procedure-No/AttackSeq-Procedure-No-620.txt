To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a watering hole attack targeting iOS users, leading to the download and execution of the lightSpy malware.
   - The malware installs a modular backdoor for remote command execution and file manipulation.
   - It is designed for data exfiltration, including various types of user and device data.
   - The malware uses a sophisticated spyware with a modular design for module updates and remote command dispatch.
   - The infection involves exploiting vulnerabilities and using a legitimate Apple developer certificate.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after collecting data, the lightSpy malware is likely to use DNS Calculation (specifically, multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet) to determine the command and control port for module updates and data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the capabilities and behaviors of the lightSpy malware, including its data collection and exfiltration capabilities, but it does not specifically mention the use of DNS Calculation for determining command and control ports.
   - The report highlights the malware's modular design, its ability to update modules, and its use of remote command execution, but the method of calculating or determining the command and control port is not specified.
   - The described method of DNS Calculation (multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet) to determine the command and control port is a specific technical detail that would be unusual to be omitted if it were a key part of the malware's operation, given the level of detail provided about its other capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the lightSpy malware's capabilities as described in the CTI report, focusing on its data collection, exfiltration, and command and control capabilities.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the report does not explicitly mention the use of DNS Calculation for determining command and control ports.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the specificity of the question regarding the method of DNS Calculation and how it does not align with the detailed but general descriptions of the malware's command and control capabilities in the report.
   - **Step 4**: Given the lack of specific information in the CTI report about the method of determining command and control ports and considering the detailed nature of the report, it is reasonable to conclude that the described DNS Calculation method is not explicitly linked to the lightSpy malware's operations as described.

**Final Answer: B**
