To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses the Elderwood Project, a group known for targeting various industries.
   - They have established command and control (C&C) servers for controlling compromised systems and retrieving commands.
   - The group is known for using an unlimited number of zero-day exploits and has a history of significant attacks, including the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009.
   - They have developed the 'Elderwood platform' for quickly deploying zero-day exploits.
   - The primary goal is the wholesale theft of intellectual property.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing C&C servers, the Elderwood Project attackers will deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
   - The key elements here are the establishment of C&C servers, the deployment of zero-day exploits, and the use of watering hole attacks as a method for gaining initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know the Elderwood Project uses C&C servers and has the capability to deploy zero-day exploits through their Elderwood platform.
   - The report mentions the group's systematic approach to attacks, including compromising numerous websites and focusing on intellectual property theft.
   - Watering hole attacks, which involve compromising websites frequently visited by individuals from a specific industry or sector to infect their devices, can be a method for gaining initial access.
   - Given the group's history of using zero-day exploits and their focus on intellectual property theft, it's plausible they would use such exploits in watering hole attacks to gain initial access to targeted systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Elderwood Project has the capability to deploy zero-day exploits.
   - **Step 2**: They have a history of using these exploits in significant attacks.
   - **Step 3**: Watering hole attacks can be an effective method for gaining initial access to targeted systems.
   - **Step 4**: The group's focus on intellectual property theft aligns with the use of sophisticated methods like zero-day exploits in watering hole attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the capabilities of the Elderwood Project, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing C&C servers, they would deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks as part of their attack strategy.

Final Answer: A
