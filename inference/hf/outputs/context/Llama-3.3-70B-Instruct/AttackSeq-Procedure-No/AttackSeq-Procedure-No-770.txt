To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by Tortoiseshell that starts with **Reconnaissance** using a fake website to trick users into downloading a malware downloader.
   - The downloaded app serves as a malware downloader, which is categorized under **Initial Access**.
   - The malware downloader **executes** two binaries, including a reconnaissance tool and a RAT.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques are used, such as checking for Google reachability and modular design of the RAT.
   - **Discovery** is performed by the reconnaissance tool to gather detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control** is established with a C2 server, with the IP address provided as an argument to the service.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after executing a malware downloader and before employing the RAT to communicate with the C2 server, Tortoiseshell is likely to use cron to create pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs on a Linux system for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of cron jobs for persistence on Linux systems. However, it does describe a sophisticated attack sequence involving reconnaissance, initial access, execution, defense evasion, discovery, and command and control.
   - The question specifically asks about creating pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs on a Linux system using cron for persistence. While the report details various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Tortoiseshell, it does not explicitly mention the use of cron jobs or specifically target Linux systems for persistence in this manner.
   - Given the modular design of the RAT and the focus on evading defenses, it's plausible that Tortoiseshell could use various persistence mechanisms. However, the report does not provide direct evidence or imply the specific use of cron jobs for persistence on Linux systems as part of their TTPs in this context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of attack tactics used by Tortoiseshell but does not specifically mention the use of cron jobs on Linux systems for persistence.
   - The question asks about a specific technique (using cron for persistence) that is not directly addressed in the report.
   - Given the information provided and the focus on the attack sequence described, the most accurate answer based on the report's content would be that there is no explicit indication of Tortoiseshell using cron jobs for persistence on Linux systems as part of the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: B
