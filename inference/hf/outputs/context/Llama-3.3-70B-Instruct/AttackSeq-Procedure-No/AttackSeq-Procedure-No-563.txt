To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report discusses various tactics used by the threat actors involved in the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, including Reconnaissance, Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, and Impact.
   - Key points relevant to the question include:
     - The use of T1553 Subvert Trust Controls for Defense Evasion.
     - The employment of T1071 Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control.
     - The report does not explicitly mention T1057 Process Discovery but implies that the attackers had a deep understanding of the target networks and systems, which could involve process discovery.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses, it is likely that the threat actors used T1057 Process Discovery only after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.
   - This involves understanding the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and their logical order in the context of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls** is a technique used for Defense Evasion, indicating the attackers were trying to avoid detection by manipulating trust mechanisms within the system.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol** is used for Command and Control, showing that the attackers had established a means to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery** would logically be used to gather information about running processes on the compromised systems, which could be useful for various purposes, including evasion, exploitation, and maintaining persistence.
   - Given the attackers' demonstrated sophistication and the need for detailed system knowledge to effectively use subverted trust controls and establish command and control, it's plausible that process discovery was conducted at some point during the operation. However, the question's specific sequence (using T1057 only after T1071) might not be the only logical order, as process discovery could also precede or occur concurrently with command and control establishment to facilitate it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers demonstrated a high level of sophistication and understanding of the target systems.
   - The use of T1553 Subvert Trust Controls and T1071 Application Layer Protocol indicates a level of access and control that would likely require or benefit from process discovery.
   - However, the question's assumption that T1057 Process Discovery was used only after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol might not be the only possible sequence. Process discovery could be an ongoing process or occur at various stages of the attack to support different objectives.
   - Given the information provided and the logical flow of attack operations, it's reasonable to consider that process discovery could have been used at any point where the attackers needed to understand the system processes better, which could include before, during, or after establishing command and control.

**Final Answer: B**
