To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report and the question itself.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines a cyber attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
   - **Initial Access**: Attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet, allowing all incoming traffic access. They also built files on the host from base64 and created public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
   - Other tactics mentioned include Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Command and Control, Exfiltration, and Impact.

2. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access, it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence of actions: whether the detection of compromised Docker APIs (potentially using tools like DOCKERGEDDON) happens after the deployment of malicious containers as part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports is an initial access tactic. This implies that the attackers are already aware of the vulnerability and are exploiting it to gain access.
   - The use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON for detecting vulnerabilities in Docker APIs would typically be part of the reconnaissance phase, which precedes the initial access. However, the question posits its use after the deployment of malicious containers, which seems out of sequence with typical attack patterns.
   - Given the context, it's more logical that the detection of vulnerabilities (including the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON) would occur before or as part of the initial access phase, not after deploying malicious containers as a separate step during reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - Misconfigured Docker API ports are exploited.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the role of reconnaissance - Typically involves identifying vulnerabilities, which could include using tools like DOCKERGEDDON.
   - **Step 3**: Analyze the question's premise - It suggests using DOCKERGEDDON after deploying malicious containers, which seems to misalign with the typical sequence of attack phases.
   - **Step 4**: Conclusion - Given the standard attack sequence and the tactics outlined in the CTI report, it's unlikely that detecting compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON would occur only after deploying malicious containers as part of reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B**
