To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence that includes:
     1. **Resource Development**: Acquiring infrastructure (domains) and developing capabilities (malware and tools like Empire).
     2. **Initial Access**: Sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment to exploit a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444).
     3. **Execution**: Exploiting the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability and using PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for execution.
     4. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through hijacked COM objects and creating a local account.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Using reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal malicious payload execution.
   - The report mentions the use of domains as command and control (C2) servers but does not explicitly discuss the use of secondary C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using reflective code loading for defense evasion, it's likely that the adversaries will use secondary C2 servers for communication after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers.
   - The question implies a sequence where the initial communication is with primary C2 servers, and then there might be a switch or addition of secondary C2 servers for further communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the initial setup and exploitation phases, including defense evasion techniques.
   - The use of secondary C2 servers is a common tactic for maintaining persistence and evading detection, as it allows threat actors to distribute their command and control infrastructure, making it harder for defenders to track and block all communication channels.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of secondary C2 servers, the context provided (use of domains for C2 servers, advanced evasion techniques) suggests a sophisticated operation that could likely involve complex C2 communication strategies.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The adversaries have demonstrated sophistication in their attack, including the use of specific malware (Graphite), tools (Empire), and evasion techniques (reflective code loading).
   - **Step 2**: The use of domains as C2 servers indicates an intention to maintain command and control over compromised systems.
   - **Step 3**: Advanced threat actors often diversify their C2 infrastructure to ensure continued access and to evade detection.
   - **Step 4**: Given the context of defense evasion and the establishment of a robust C2 channel, it is plausible that secondary C2 servers would be used to further secure the adversaries' grip on compromised systems and to adapt to potential disruptions.

**Final Answer: A**
