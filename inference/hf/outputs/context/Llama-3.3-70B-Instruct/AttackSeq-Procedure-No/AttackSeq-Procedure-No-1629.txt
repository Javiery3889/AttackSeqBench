To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains access through credential stuffing or password spraying attacks on remote services like webmail or VPN, using previously breached usernames and passwords.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms. They achieve persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes, such as servers, where the beacon can remain active for longer periods.
   - **Other Tactics:** The report mentions various tactics, including privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and exfiltration. However, the question focuses on the persistence mechanism after initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after obtaining access to the victim's network, the adversary is likely to rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of scheduled tasks for executing the Cobalt Strike beacon. Instead, it mentions that the adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system and achieves persistence by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
   - The report highlights the use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for maintaining access but does not specify the use of scheduled tasks as a method for executing the beacon.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary's primary method of maintaining persistence, as described, involves targeting systems that are less likely to be restarted, ensuring the beacon remains active.
   - There is no mention of scheduled tasks being used to execute the beacon after achieving persistence.
   - The focus on systems with high uptimes suggests a strategy to keep the beacon active without needing to rely on traditional persistence mechanisms like scheduled tasks.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information in the CTI report and the specifics of the question, the most plausible answer is that the adversary does not rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

**Final Answer: B**
