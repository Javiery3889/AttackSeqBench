To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report mentions that after gaining access, the group seeks to maintain persistent access by dropping further tooling and/or obtaining legitimate credentials.
   - It also mentions the use of custom malware (WellMess or WellMail) for conducting further operations, which includes executing arbitrary shell commands and uploading/downloading files.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the use of public exploits or vulnerability scanning as part of their tactics.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after maintaining persistent access with stolen credentials, the group is likely to deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
   - This implies a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures): 
     1. Maintaining access with stolen credentials.
     2. Conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
     3. Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly describe the group conducting vulnerability scanning or deploying public exploits as part of their tactics after gaining access.
   - The report focuses on the use of custom malware for further operations and maintaining access, not on exploiting vulnerabilities through public exploits after scanning.
   - Given the information, the sequence of TTPs described in the question (vulnerability scanning followed by deploying public exploits) is not directly supported by the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary tactics mentioned in the CTI report for post-access operations, which include using custom malware and maintaining access.
   - **Step 2**: Compare these tactics with the sequence of TTPs proposed in the question, which involves vulnerability scanning and deploying public exploits.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the CTI report does not explicitly support the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, it does not explicitly support the idea that the group conducts vulnerability scanning followed by deploying public exploits as a standard part of their operations after gaining access.

Final Answer: B
