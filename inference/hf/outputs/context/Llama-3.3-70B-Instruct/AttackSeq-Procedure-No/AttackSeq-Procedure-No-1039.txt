To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics used by the Inception attackers, starting with Reconnaissance, followed by Initial Access via exploiting an Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) using remote templates in Microsoft Word.
   - After gaining Initial Access, the report mentions Persistence, where POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.
   - This indicates a sequence where initial access is gained, and then persistence is established.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after gaining initial access through the Office vulnerability, the attackers are likely to establish persistence by writing to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence of events after initial access is gained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we understand that after initial access, the attackers use POWERSHOWER to establish persistence. This implies that POWERSHOWER is involved in setting up persistence.
   - The question asks if persistence is established before deploying POWERSHOWER. However, according to the report, POWERSHOWER itself is the tool used to set up persistence by writing to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.
   - This means that the deployment of POWERSHOWER and the establishment of persistence are closely linked, with POWERSHOWER being the means by which persistence is achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The report indicates that POWERSHOWER is used for persistence.
   - The question asks if persistence is established before POWERSHOWER is deployed.
   - Given that POWERSHOWER is the mechanism for establishing persistence, it does not make sense for persistence to be established before POWERSHOWER is deployed.
   - Therefore, the correct sequence is that POWERSHOWER is deployed as part of establishing persistence, not that persistence is established before POWERSHOWER.

Final Answer: B
