To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Aurora operation's initial access method using a JavaScript-based exploit vector targeting Internet Explorer 6.
   - Execution involves a two-stage installation process with a dropper that installs a payload as a service, which then deletes the first service and registers a second service pointing to the same backdoor DLL.
   - Persistence is achieved by installing the malware as a service under random names and modifying registry keys.
   - Defense evasion techniques include modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL, loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process, and deleting the dropper using a dissolving batch file.
   - The report mentions the malware accessing an encrypted embedded resource to obtain the C&C (Command and Control) server DNS name but does not specify the protocol used for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after evading detection, the Aurora malware is likely to communicate with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
   - The key elements here are the specifics of the C2 communication protocol (Jabber/XMPP) and the servers (operated by Google).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 communication or specify that the C2 servers are operated by Google.
   - The report focuses on the technical details of the exploit, execution, persistence, and defense evasion techniques but lacks specific information about the C2 communication protocol and the identity of the C2 server operators.
   - Given the information provided, there's no direct evidence to support the claim that the Aurora malware uses the Jabber/XMPP protocol to communicate with Google-operated servers for C2.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question, which are the protocol (Jabber/XMPP) and the server operator (Google) for C2 communication.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the CTI report does not provide explicit information about the C2 communication protocol or the operators of the C2 servers.
   - **Step 3**: Conclude that without explicit information linking the Aurora malware's C2 communications to the Jabber/XMPP protocol and Google-operated servers, the most reasonable answer based on the provided CTI report is that it is unlikely.
   - **Final Answer**: B
