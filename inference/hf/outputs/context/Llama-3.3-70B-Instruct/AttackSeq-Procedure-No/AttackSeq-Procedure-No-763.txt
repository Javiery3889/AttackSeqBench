To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign by Iranian state-backed hackers, known as "The Return of The Charming Kitten."
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting information on targets, including cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location before phishing attacks.
     2. **Initial Access**: Utilizing phishing attacks through unknown email or social media accounts and compromised accounts of public figures.
     3. **Persistence**: Not changing passwords to remain undetected and monitor communications.
     4. **Credential Access**: Using phishing pages for desktop and mobile versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services to verify credentials and bypass two-factor authentication.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets after deploying phishing attacks and then proceeded with other tactics.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves collecting detailed target information, deploying phishing attacks, and then potentially using methods like hidden tracking images and artifact-based images for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that the attackers collected information on their targets prior to phishing attacks, tailoring their approach based on the target's details.
   - This indicates that the collection of detailed information was a precursor to the phishing attacks, not a step taken after deploying these attacks.
   - The question's scenario suggests a different sequence where detailed information collection and the use of specific evasion techniques occur after the initial phishing attempts, which does not align with the report's description.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the sequence of events as described in the CTI report, which places reconnaissance before phishing attacks.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question's proposed sequence of events, which suggests a different order.
   - **Step 3**: Compare the two sequences and note the discrepancy in the timing of when detailed target information is collected.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is unlikely that Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets only after deploying phishing attacks, as the report explicitly states this collection occurred beforehand.

Final Answer: B
