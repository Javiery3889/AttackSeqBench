To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the RevengeHotels campaign targeting the hospitality sector.
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign uses spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0199 to execute macro code, which downloads and executes malware.
   - **Execution**: The downloaded malware includes RATs (Remote Access Trojans) like RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC, which are protected with obfuscators. A module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data by monitoring web pages.
   - **Credential Access**: The attackers aim to capture credit card data and sell credentials for remote access to compromised systems.
   - **Others**: The campaign has been active since at least 2015, targeting the hospitality sector with traditional RAT malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after capturing credentials, the malware is likely to utilize tools to capture mouse movements.
   - This involves understanding the capabilities and goals of the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that the malware captures credit card data by monitoring web pages (e.g., booking.com) and has capabilities such as collecting data from the clipboard and printer spooler, as well as capturing screenshots.
   - Capturing mouse movements could potentially be a method to gather more information about user interactions, possibly to enhance the stealing of sensitive information like credit card numbers or to understand user behavior for future phishing campaigns.
   - However, the report specifically highlights the focus on capturing credit card data, selling credentials, and using RATs for remote access. While capturing mouse movements could be a theoretical extension of these capabilities, it is not explicitly mentioned as a tactic used by the RevengeHotels campaign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The primary goals of the RevengeHotels campaign, as described, are to capture credit card data and sell credentials for remote access.
   - The campaign's methods include using RATs for executing malicious code, capturing screenshots, and monitoring specific web pages for credit card data.
   - While the campaign is sophisticated and includes various tools for data theft, the specific action of capturing mouse movements is not mentioned in the report.
   - Given the focus on credit card data capture and the sale of remote access credentials, and without explicit mention of mouse movement capture, it seems less likely that this is a primary or emphasized tactic of the campaign.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, the most plausible answer is that capturing mouse movements is not a highlighted or primary tactic of the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign.

Final Answer: B
