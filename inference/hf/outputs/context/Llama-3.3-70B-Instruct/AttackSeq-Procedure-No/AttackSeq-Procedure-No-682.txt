To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details an attack sequence that starts with **Initial Access**, where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
   - This initial access is followed by various tactics including **Execution**, **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Command and Control**, **Exfiltration**, and **Impact**.
   - The report highlights the use of malicious container images, exploitation of supply-chain processes, and the execution of crypto miners during the auto-build of an image process.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports, it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.
   - This implies a step of **Reconnaissance** that is not explicitly listed in the report but is a common precursor to targeted attacks, especially those involving supply chain compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions a "massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI," which suggests that attackers have an interest in supply chain processes and are likely to gather information about an organization's supply chain to effectively target it.
   - The use of typo-squatting (e.g., "Tesnorflow" instead of "Tensorflow") to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images indicates a level of reconnaissance and understanding of the target's software dependencies and supply chain.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that adversaries gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance, the nature of the attacks (targeting supply chain processes, using social engineering tactics like typo-squatting) implies some level of reconnaissance and planning.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - Misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the context of the attack - Targeting supply chain processes and using social engineering.
   - **Step 3**: Infer the necessity of reconnaissance - Given the targeted nature of the attacks, especially those involving supply chain compromise, some level of reconnaissance is likely necessary to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points.
   - **Step 4**: Conclusion - While the report does not explicitly mention a detailed reconnaissance phase focused on supply chain relationships, the tactics employed suggest that some form of reconnaissance or gathering of information about the target's supply chain is plausible and likely necessary for the success of such targeted attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
