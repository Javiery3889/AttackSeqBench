To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the SkinnyBoy malware's execution, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and exfiltration tactics.
   - Key points relevant to communication with the C2 server include:
     - The malware establishes a connection to the C2 server `updaterweb[.]com` on port 443 (or port 80 if the first attempt fails).
     - It uses the `HttpOpenRequestW` routine to create an HTTP POST request handle and adds an HTTP request header.
     - The malware exfiltrates collected information using an HTTP POST request with a specific structure that includes base64 encoded data.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if SkinnyBoy is likely to obfuscate C2 traffic with an altered version of base64 before communicating with the C2 server.
   - The question focuses on the method of communication and potential obfuscation techniques used by the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the malware collects data and then exfiltrates it to the C2 server using an HTTP POST request. The data is base64 encoded.
   - There is no explicit mention of using an "altered version of base64" for obfuscating C2 traffic. However, the use of base64 encoding for the data being exfiltrated suggests that the malware does employ encoding as a form of obfuscation or data preparation for transmission.
   - The question's phrasing about an "altered version of base64" might imply a modification or customization of the standard base64 encoding algorithm for additional obfuscation. The report does not provide details on any alterations to the base64 encoding process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of data encoding used by SkinnyBoy for C2 communication. The report specifies base64 encoding for the exfiltrated data.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if the report suggests any alteration or customization of the base64 encoding. There is no explicit mention of altering the base64 encoding method.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the implications of the question's wording. The question asks about obfuscation with an "altered version of base64," which might not be directly addressed by the report's description of using base64 encoding for data exfiltration.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided. Choice A (Yes) implies an affirmative action of obfuscating with an altered base64, which is not directly supported by the report. Choice B (No) suggests that there is no indication of using an altered version of base64 for obfuscation, aligning with the report's lack of detail on customizing the base64 encoding.

Given the information in the CTI report and the specific wording of the question, the most accurate answer based on the provided details is:

**Final Answer: B**
