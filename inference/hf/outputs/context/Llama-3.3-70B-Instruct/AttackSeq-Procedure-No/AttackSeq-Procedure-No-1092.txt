To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193) via an email with a malicious Excel document.
     2. **Execution**: User Execution (T1204) through a hidden object in the Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Techniques used include File Deletion (T1107), Hidden Files and Directories (T1158), and Software Packing (T1045).
     4. **Collection**: Data from Local System (T1005).
     5. **Command and Control**: Using Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071).
     6. **Exfiltration**: Data Encrypted (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using software packing for defense evasion and deleting the original file, SWEED's malware is likely to sniff network traffic to collect credentials before dropping a PE file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions the use of defense evasion techniques including software packing (T1045) and file deletion (T1107), which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - The report also mentions the collection of data from the local system (T1005), which could imply credential collection.
   - However, the specific action of sniffing network traffic to collect credentials is not directly mentioned in the report. The report does mention the implementation of LokiBot, which is known for its credential theft capabilities, including through network traffic sniffing.
   - The dropping of a PE file is mentioned in the "Others" section of the report, with a specific hash provided, indicating that the malware does involve dropping executable files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the information in the CTI report, SWEED's attack involves sophisticated techniques for initial access, execution, defense evasion, and data collection.
   - The use of LokiBot, a malware known for credential theft, suggests that credential collection is a goal of the attack.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the malware sniffs network traffic for credential collection, the implementation of LokiBot and the overall goals of the attack (data collection and exfiltration) make it plausible that such actions could be part of the attack sequence.
   - Therefore, considering the capabilities of LokiBot and the objectives of the attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware could indeed sniff network traffic to collect credentials before or as part of dropping a PE file.

Final Answer: A
