To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a phishing campaign targeting Portuguese users with emails that mimic the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax.
   - The emails contain links that download a zip file named 'FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.zip'.
   - This zip file contains a VBScript file that acts as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.
   - The Lampion trojan achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder.
   - The trojan employs various techniques for defense evasion and communicates with a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Lampion's phishing emails will execute payloads via shell scripting instead of downloading and running specific files ('P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip') before achieving persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder.
   - The question essentially inquires about the plausibility of a different initial execution method (shell scripting) compared to what is described in the report (downloading a zip file containing a VBScript).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report specifically mentions that the phishing emails lead to the download of a zip file, which contains a VBScript file acting as a dropper for the Lampion trojan.
   - There is no mention of shell scripting as a method for executing payloads in the initial stages of the attack as described in the report.
   - The report does detail the creation of a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder for persistence, which aligns with one part of the question but does not support the execution via shell scripting as an initial step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a specific sequence of events starting with phishing emails, leading to the download of a zip file, extraction of a VBScript file, and the eventual download and installation of the Lampion trojan.
   - The question posits an alternative initial execution method (shell scripting) that is not supported by the details provided in the CTI report.
   - Given the information in the report, the described method of downloading a zip file and executing a VBScript is the documented approach, not the execution via shell scripting as an initial step.
   - Therefore, based on the CTI report, it is not likely that Lampion's phishing emails will execute payloads via shell scripting as described in the question, making the correct answer "No".

Final Answer: B
