To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where attackers target Instagram users, particularly influencers, by impersonating technical support or friends.
   - The attackers use phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram messages to deliver their scam, often claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites.
   - After obtaining the credentials, the attackers change the account passwords and download all images and messages, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

2. **Identify the Attack Sequence**:
   - Initial Access: Phishing to obtain credentials.
   - Credential Access: Using phishing sites to collect usernames, passwords, and email credentials.
   - Actions after Credential Access: Changing account passwords and downloading data (images and messages).

3. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting victims' Instagram credentials, it is likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
   - The question essentially inquires about the sequence of actions post-credential access, specifically regarding the handling of backup services.

4. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions that after obtaining credentials, the attackers download all images and messages, "either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature."
   - This implies that the attackers are interested in accessing the data, including backups, rather than stopping backup services.
   - There is no indication in the report that the attackers need to stop backup services to achieve their goals. Instead, they utilize the existing features, including data backup, to their advantage.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers' goal is to access and download the victims' data.
   - They use the obtained credentials to change passwords, locking out the original owners.
   - The report does not suggest that stopping backup services is necessary for their objectives; rather, they leverage these services to download data.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that stopping specific services related to backups is a necessary step for the attackers before locking out the original owners.

**Final Answer: B**
