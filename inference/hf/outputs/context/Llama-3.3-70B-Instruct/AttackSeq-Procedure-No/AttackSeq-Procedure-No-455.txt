To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control, potentially exploiting security vulnerabilities.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and the use of multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement, Command and Control, and Others:** These sections provide additional context about the attack's capabilities, evasion techniques, and the threat actor's relationship with the Cobalt Strike platform.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question focuses on the sequence of events after initial access, specifically whether Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after employing multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that after gaining initial access, APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection, including running in memory. This implies that the execution of Shellcode scripts in memory is part of the attack's evasion strategy.
   - The use of multi-beacon communication is also mentioned as a defense evasion technique, suggesting it is part of the attack's strategy to remain undetected.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that multi-beacon communication must precede the execution of Shellcode scripts in memory. Instead, it suggests that both are part of the attack's evasion strategies.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question essentially asks if the execution of Shellcode scripts in memory is contingent upon the employment of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.
   - Given the information, it's reasonable to infer that both techniques (running in memory and multi-beacon communication) are used for defense evasion but are not necessarily sequential in the order implied by the question.
   - The report does not provide a clear sequence where multi-beacon communication must be established before Shellcode scripts can be executed in memory. Both are evasion techniques that can be used to maintain the attack's stealthiness.

**Final Answer: B**
