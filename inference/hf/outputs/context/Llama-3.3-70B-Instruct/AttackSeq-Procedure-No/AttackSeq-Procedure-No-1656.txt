To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The FHAPPI campaign starts with an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware is a VBScript encoded script that, when executed, downloads and opens a .doc file.
   - The opening of the .doc file leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
   - The PowerShell attack infects the victim's system with Poison Ivy.
   - The malware communicates with a C2 server and avoids detection through multiple encodings and being fileless.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the initial infection process, it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.
   - The question essentially compares two methods of achieving persistence and further execution on a compromised system: using cron jobs (typically associated with Linux/macOS systems) versus using PowerShell (more commonly associated with Windows systems).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report specifies that the malware leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy. This indicates that the campaign is targeting Windows systems, as PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft.
   - Installing itself as a cron job would be more typical for malware targeting Linux or macOS systems, as cron is a job scheduler for these operating systems.
   - Given the specifics of the attack (use of PowerShell and Poison Ivy, which is a Windows-based remote access tool), it is less likely that the malware would use a cron job for further execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The FHAPPI campaign's use of PowerShell for the attack indicates a focus on Windows systems.
   - The use of cron jobs is more relevant to Linux or macOS systems, which does not align with the specifics of the FHAPPI campaign as described.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, it is unlikely that the malware would install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

Final Answer: B
