To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The NewsBeef APT group (APT33) uses spearphishing and watering hole attacks for initial access.
   - They utilize malicious macro-enabled Microsoft Office documents, PowerSploit, and the Pupy backdoor.
   - The documents are delivered via email and social media/messaging applications.
   - Compromised websites are injected with JavaScript to redirect visitors to attacker-controlled servers.
   - The Pupy backdoor uses the obfs3 protocol for command and control communications.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial access, Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic.
   - This involves understanding if the described actions (using DDE to execute PowerShell commands for delivering specific malware) align with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described in the CTI report.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions the use of macro-enabled Office documents for initial access, which could potentially include executing malicious code.
   - However, it specifically mentions the use of PowerSploit and the Pupy backdoor, not the execution of PowerShell commands through DDE or the delivery of JHUHUGIT and Koadic.
   - PowerSploit is a PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework, which implies PowerShell usage but does not directly mention DDE for command execution.
   - The report does not explicitly mention JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of their toolset.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access methods and tools mentioned in the report (spearphishing, watering hole attacks, macro-enabled documents, PowerSploit, Pupy backdoor).
   - **Step 2**: Understand the question's focus on the execution phase, specifically the use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands for delivering JHUHUGIT and Koadic.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that while the report mentions macro-enabled documents and PowerSploit (which involves PowerShell), it does not specifically mention DDE, JHUHUGIT, or Koadic.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the context that the report provides about the group's evolving tactics and toolsets, including a shift towards new tools but without explicit mention of the specific techniques or malware in question.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report, there is no direct evidence to support that the NewsBeef group uses Word documents to execute PowerShell commands through DDE to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of their campaign's execution phase. The report highlights the use of macro-enabled documents and PowerSploit but does not specify the use of DDE for command execution or the delivery of the mentioned malware.

Final Answer: B
