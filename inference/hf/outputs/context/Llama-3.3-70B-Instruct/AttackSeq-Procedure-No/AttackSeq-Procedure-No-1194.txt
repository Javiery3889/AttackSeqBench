To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: A malspam campaign uses a PDF with an embedded RTF file exploiting CVE-2017-8579 to download and execute a malicious file.
     2. **Execution**: The downloaded file leads to the installation of ComboJack malware.
     3. **Persistence**: ComboJack ensures persistence by copying itself, setting hidden and system attributes, and creating a registry key.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: ComboJack hides itself and executes with SYSTEM level privileges.
     5. **Impact**: ComboJack alters clipboard contents to redirect cryptocurrency funds to the attacker.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after ensuring persistence and hiding itself, ComboJack is likely to store output from command execution in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory before replacing wallet addresses and attempting to redirect funds.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the attack sequence and the behaviors of ComboJack, including its ability to alter clipboard contents for financial gain.
   - The question posits a specific behavior (storing output in a .dat file) that is not directly mentioned in the report but is plausible given the malware's capabilities and goals.
   - The report does indicate that ComboJack executes with SYSTEM level privileges and has the capability to manipulate system attributes and registry keys, suggesting it has the access and capabilities to perform various system interactions, including potentially storing data in temporary files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence and ComboJack's capabilities as described.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the specific action of storing output in a .dat file is not directly mentioned but consider if it aligns with the malware's behavior and goals.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the plausibility of this action given the malware's access level and system manipulation capabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given ComboJack's sophisticated nature, including its ability to evade defenses, ensure persistence, and manipulate the system for financial gain, it is plausible that it could store temporary data in a .dat file as part of its operation, especially if this aids in its primary function of altering clipboard contents to redirect funds.

Final Answer: A
