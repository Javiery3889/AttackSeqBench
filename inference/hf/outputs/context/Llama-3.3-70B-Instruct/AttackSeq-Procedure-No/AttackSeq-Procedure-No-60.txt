To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Grandoreiro, a Latin American banking trojan, and its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Initial Access**: Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails, exploiting COVID-19 fears, and fake updates.
   - **Persistence**: It creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to maintain its foothold across restarts.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Employs various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and privilege escalation by registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files.
   - **Credential Access**: Steals credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Discovery**: Collects information about victims, including computer name, username, OS version, and installed security products.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer.
   - The key points here are restarting in safe mode and the purpose of evading detection to collect information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention Grandoreiro restarting a compromised machine in safe mode as part of its tactics.
   - The report focuses on how Grandoreiro gains persistence, escalates privileges, and collects information without indicating a need to restart in safe mode for these activities.
   - The techniques described for persistence (e.g., creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory) and for collecting information (e.g., listing installed security products) do not inherently require the system to be in safe mode.
   - Restarting in safe mode could potentially be a tactic to evade detection, but the report highlights other evasion techniques, such as using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) and binary padding, without mentioning system restarts in safe mode.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary tactics and techniques used by Grandoreiro as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question's focus on restarting in safe mode to evade detection.
   - **Step 3**: Compare the tactics described in the report with the scenario presented in the question.
   - **Step 4**: Since the report does not mention restarting in safe mode as a tactic and given that the described TTPs do not necessitate such an action for their success, it's reasonable to conclude that restarting in safe mode is not a likely part of Grandoreiro's tactics based on the information provided.
   
Final Answer: B
