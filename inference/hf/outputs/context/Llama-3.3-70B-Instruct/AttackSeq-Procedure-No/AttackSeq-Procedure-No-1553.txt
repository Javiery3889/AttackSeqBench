To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents. These documents had embedded links that would send a GET request to the attacker's server when opened in Microsoft Word.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used an undocumented Word feature to evade detection. The documents appeared benign since they contained no macros, exploits, or active content.
   - **Others:** The report highlights an undocumented Microsoft Word feature involving the INCLUDEPICTURE field, which can contain a link. The attackers exploited this by using a Unicode link that Word would ignore but still follow a URL attached to a form within the document, leading to the attackers' server.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would first gain initial access through OLE2 format documents in spear phishing emails and then use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the initial access vector was through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links. When these documents were opened, they would send a GET request to the attacker's server.
   - The question essentially describes the initial access method and then implies a subsequent action (using a technique to inform the attackers about installed software during reconnaissance) that aligns with the behavior of sending a GET request upon opening the document. This GET request could potentially inform the attackers about the success of the initial access and possibly about the environment (such as installed software) if the request includes such information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The attackers used spear phishing emails with OLE2 documents for initial access.
   - **Step 2:** These documents, when opened, sent a GET request to the attackers' server, which could serve as a method to confirm the initial access and potentially gather information about the target environment.
   - **Step 3:** The technique described in the question (using Microsoft Word to send a GET request) matches the behavior described in the CTI report as the method of initial access and could logically extend to informing the attackers about the installed software as part of reconnaissance.

Given the information in the CTI report and the description in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence of events described in the question aligns with the attack methods used by the Freakyshelly attackers.

**Final Answer: A**
