To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - The report describes a cyber attack using the Vyveva backdoor by the Lazarus group.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics includes:
     1. **Execution (T1569.002, T1106):** Vyveva executes via a service and uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution.
     2. **Persistence (T1543.003):** Establishes persistence through a new service for its loader.
     3. **Defense Evasion (T1140, T1070.006, T1036.004, T1112, T1027):** Includes decrypting strings and components, timestomping files, masquerading tasks or services, modifying the registry, and having encrypted strings and components.
     4. **Discovery (T1083, T1057, T1082, T1016, T1124):** Obtains file and directory listings, lists running processes, obtains system information, gets the local IP address, and system time and time zone.
     5. **Command and Control (T1573.001, T1573.002, T1041):** Encrypts C&C traffic, communicates via Tor, and exfiltrates data.
     6. **Exfiltration (T1041):** Exfiltrates data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after compressing and sending collected files to the C&C server, Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining specific system information through discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention collecting files from removable media as part of its capabilities. However, it does mention obtaining file and directory listings (T1083) and exfiltrating data (T1041), which could imply the capability to collect and send files.
   - The report also mentions obtaining system information such as the local IP address (T1016) and system time and time zone (T1124) as part of its discovery capabilities.
   - The question implies a sequence where after exfiltrating data, the backdoor collects files from removable media and then notifies the C&C after obtaining specific system information. This sequence involves discovery (to obtain system information) and potentially exfiltration (to send the collected files), which are both part of Vyveva's capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify if Vyveva can collect files and notify the C&C. The report indicates Vyveva can exfiltrate data (T1041), which implies it can collect and send files.
   - **Step 2:** Determine if Vyveva obtains system information before taking further actions. The discovery tactics (T1016, T1124) suggest it gathers system information, which could precede other actions like collecting files from removable media.
   - **Step 3:** Assess the likelihood of the described sequence. Given Vyveva's capabilities, it's plausible that after initial data exfiltration, it could collect files from removable media and then obtain system information (like local IP and system time) before notifying the C&C.

**Final Answer: A**
