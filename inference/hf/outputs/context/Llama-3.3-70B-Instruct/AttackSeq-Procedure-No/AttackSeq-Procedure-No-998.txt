To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Longhorn's initial access methods, including the use of back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - It mentions a specific instance where a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - The report highlights Longhorn's malware capabilities, including system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration, designed for espionage-type operations.
   - It also discusses Longhorn's command and control (C2) methods, using custom domains and IP addresses, and a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS for communication.
   - Exfiltration methods involve communicating at select times with upload limits and randomized intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after infecting a target with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit in a Word document, it is likely that Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - The question specifically mentions abusing OAuth access tokens, which is not directly mentioned in the CTI report provided.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention the use of OAuth access tokens as a tactic by Longhorn.
   - The report focuses on the use of zero-day exploits, back door Trojans, and the capabilities of their malware for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - The question introduces a new tactic (abusing OAuth access tokens) not covered in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial infection vector mentioned in the question, which aligns with the CTI report (zero-day exploit in a Word document).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question introduces a tactic (abusing OAuth access tokens) not mentioned in the CTI report.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities and tactics described in the CTI report, which focus on exploiting vulnerabilities, using custom malware for espionage, and evading detection.
   - **Step 4**: Since the CTI report does not mention the use of OAuth access tokens as part of Longhorn's tactics, and given the specific focus on malware capabilities for system fingerprinting and exfiltration, it's reasonable to conclude that the introduced tactic (abusing OAuth access tokens) is not directly supported by the information provided in the CTI report.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no direct evidence to suggest that Longhorn's tools would abuse OAuth access tokens as part of their attack sequence after initial infection.

Final Answer: B
