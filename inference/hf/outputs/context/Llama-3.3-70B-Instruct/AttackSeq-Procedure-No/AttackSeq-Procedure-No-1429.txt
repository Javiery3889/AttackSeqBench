To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines the attack sequence by MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
     2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software and downloads a second-stage payload.
     3. **Persistence**: It persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Employs techniques like daemonizing, deleting itself, and obfuscating traffic to the C2 server.
     5. **Discovery**: Collects information from the victim machine, including OS version and domain/account name values.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS with obfuscation.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Automatically exfiltrates collected data over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting the OS version, Smooth Operator is likely to perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the config.json file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that during the **Discovery** phase, Smooth Operator collects information including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json.
   - The **Command and Control** phase mentions that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, but this is not explicitly tied to the immediate actions during the discovery phase.
   - The question essentially asks if the malware communicates with the C2 server (via HTTPS) after collecting the OS version but before collecting the domain and account name values.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The report does not explicitly state that HTTPS communication with the C2 server occurs between the collection of the OS version and the collection of domain and account name values.
   - The **Discovery** phase seems to be focused on collecting various pieces of information from the victim machine.
   - The **Command and Control** phase, which involves HTTPS communication, is more about the malware's communication with its C2 servers, which could happen at various points, including after or during the collection of information.
   - Given the malware's design to collect information and then communicate with the C2 server, it's plausible that the collection of information (including OS version and other details) happens before or as part of the communication process, but the report does not specify the exact sequence of these events in relation to each other.

5. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The question seems to imply a specific sequence of events (collecting OS version, then communicating with C2, then collecting domain and account name values) that is not explicitly supported or refuted by the CTI report.
   - However, considering the nature of the malware's operation, it's reasonable to assume that the collection of information (including the OS version) and the communication with the C2 server are closely related, as the malware would likely need to report back its findings or receive further instructions.

**Final Answer: B**
