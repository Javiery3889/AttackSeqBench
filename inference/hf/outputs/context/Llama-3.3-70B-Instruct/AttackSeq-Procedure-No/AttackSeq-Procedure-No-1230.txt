To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the Lazarus group's attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB), focusing on the execution of malicious software, establishment of persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - Key points include:
     - Deployment of loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) for persistence and antivirus evasion.
     - Use of a 'Polyglot' file to hide and execute malware.
     - Utilization of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control, packed with Themida for evasion.
     - Lateral movement through hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
     - Communication with command and control servers for remote command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing command and control, the Lazarus group likely engaged in double-extortion ransomware tactics, involving file exfiltration and encryption to demand a ransom.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that includes command and control establishment, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the Lazarus group engaging in double-extortion ransomware tactics during the FEIB heist. It focuses on the execution of malicious software, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - The report highlights the use of backdoor malware for executing remote commands, which could potentially be used for exfiltrating files. However, it does not specifically mention file encryption or ransom demands.
   - Double-extortion ransomware involves exfiltrating sensitive data and then encrypting it, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid. While the Lazarus group has been known for various cybercrime activities, the CTI report provided does not directly link their actions in the FEIB heist to double-extortion ransomware tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary actions described in the CTI report - execution of malware, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report mentions capabilities that could be used for data exfiltration (like backdoor malware), it does not explicitly mention file encryption or ransom demands.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the question's implication of a sequence involving command and control, exfiltration, and ransomware, which is not directly supported by the CTI report's details on the FEIB heist.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided in the CTI report, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware tactics during the FEIB heist. The report's focus is on other aspects of the attack.

Final Answer: B
