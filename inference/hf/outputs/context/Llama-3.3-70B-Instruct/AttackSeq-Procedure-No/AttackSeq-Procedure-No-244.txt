To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by Iron Tiger, starting with **Initial Access** where a malicious executable drops files, including a batch file and a cabinet file, which contain malicious shellcode and a DLL.
   - **Execution** involves the batch file executing the DLL, which decrypts data to reveal a C&C (Command and Control) IP address and port, aiming to load and execute attacker plugins in memory.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by creating a new service or a registry key, depending on the malware's privileges.
   - The report also mentions various tools, including a modified Gh0st RAT named 'Noodles' and a primary tool named 'Mozilla', which can connect to a bind port and relies heavily on plugins for additional functionality.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the Iron Tiger malware is likely to download additional payloads onto an infected machine using a command-and-control server.
   - The key elements here are the achievement of persistence and the potential for downloading additional payloads via a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the report, we know that the malware establishes communication with a C&C server, as indicated by the decryption of data revealing a C&C IP address and port.
   - The primary goal of the shellcode is to load and execute attacker plugins in memory, which suggests a mechanism for downloading and executing additional payloads.
   - The 'Mozilla' tool's reliance on plugins and its ability to connect to a bind port further supports the capability to download and utilize additional payloads.
   - Achieving persistence (via a new service or registry key) would allow the malware to maintain its presence on the system, enabling it to receive and execute commands from the C&C server, including the potential download of additional payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware gains initial access and executes its payload, which includes setting up communication with a C&C server.
   - **Step 2**: The malware achieves persistence, ensuring it can maintain its presence on the system.
   - **Step 3**: With persistence achieved and a C&C channel established, the malware has the capability to receive commands, which could include downloading additional payloads.
   - **Step 4**: The design of the 'Mozilla' tool, with its plugin architecture, supports the dynamic addition of new functionalities, which aligns with the capability to download and execute additional payloads from a C&C server.
   
Given these steps and the information provided in the CTI report, it is reasonable to conclude that after achieving persistence, the Iron Tiger malware would likely utilize its established C&C communication channel to download additional payloads onto an infected machine.

Final Answer: A
