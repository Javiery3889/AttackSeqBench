To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Operation Sharpshooter, which starts with reconnaissance by gathering information under the guise of job recruitment.
   - Initial access is gained through malicious documents containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader, leading to the Rising Sun implant.
   - Execution involves the macro acting as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant.
   - Persistence is achieved by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - Discovery (reconnaissance) involves fetching network and system information.
   - Exfiltration is done by encrypting data with RC4 and obfuscating it with Base64 before sending it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after initial reconnaissance, the Rising Sun implant will communicate with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2) before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - The key points here are the use of the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 and communication with Google servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance, which matches the first part of the question.
   - However, the report specifies that exfiltration is done via HTTP POST requests, not through the Jabber/XMPP protocol, and there's no mention of communicating with Google servers for C2.
   - The report does mention that data is obfuscated with Base64 encoding before exfiltration, which aligns with the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question's details about using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 and communicating with Google servers do not match the information provided in the CTI report.
   - The report clearly states that exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests, not the Jabber/XMPP protocol, and does not mention Google servers.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, the scenario described in the question does not align with the known behavior of the Rising Sun implant.

Final Answer: B
