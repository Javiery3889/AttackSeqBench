To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the CosmicDuke malware's infection process, which involves deceiving victims into opening malicious files.
   - It details the execution mechanism, which includes using a loader similar to MiniDuke's.
   - Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks and a Windows service.
   - Credential access involves stealing credentials from various software and Windows components.
   - Discovery includes searching for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - Command and Control (C2) communication is via HTTP GET requests, with data exfiltration using FTP and WebDav servers.
   - Exfiltration involves uploading collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types, CosmicDuke is likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom LZW algorithm before exfiltrating the data via FTP.
   - The key points here are the compression method (LZW algorithm) and the exfiltration method (FTP).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the configuration, including server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1, not LZW.
   - There is no specific mention of compressing output data generated by command execution with a custom LZW algorithm before exfiltration.
   - The report does detail the use of FTP for exfiltrating collected data, which aligns with the question's mention of exfiltration via FTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the compression algorithm mentioned in the report, which is similar to LZNT-1, not LZW.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question specifies a custom LZW algorithm for compressing output data, which is not mentioned in the report.
   - **Step 3**: Note that while the report does mention exfiltration via FTP, the specific method of compression before exfiltration (using a custom LZW algorithm) is not supported by the information provided.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, there is no indication that CosmicDuke uses a custom LZW algorithm for compressing data before exfiltration. The report specifies a compression algorithm similar to LZNT-1 for configuration data, not LZW for output data.

Final Answer: B
