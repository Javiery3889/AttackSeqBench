To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with **Initial Access** through a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - The actors then used the AntSword webshell for **Execution** of various commands, including system and user discovery, and uploaded tools like Mimikatz and Impacket's wmiexec and atexec.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques were employed using a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - For **Credential Access**, Mimikatz was used to dump credentials, and Impacket tools were used for pass-the-hash techniques.
   - **Lateral Movement** was achieved by using webshells, dumping credentials with Mimikatz, and using Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - **Command and Control** was maintained through the AntSword webshell.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after using Mimikatz for credential dumping and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash, it's likely the actors would display network connections using the netstat command before moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after gaining initial access and executing commands for discovery, the actors focused on credential access and lateral movement.
   - The use of netstat to display network connections would be a logical step for **Discovery** (which is a MITRE ATT&CK tactic not explicitly mentioned but implied in the actions taken for system and user discovery) before or during lateral movement, as it would help in identifying potential targets within the network.
   - The report mentions the actors used the AntSword webshell to "ping systems of interest," which implies some form of network discovery or reconnaissance.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of the netstat command, the actions described (such as pinging systems of interest and moving laterally) suggest that some form of network discovery or reconnaissance was performed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors' goal after gaining access and dumping credentials would be to move laterally within the network.
   - To do so effectively, they would need to understand the network topology and identify potential targets, which could involve displaying network connections.
   - The use of netstat or similar commands for network discovery aligns with the tactics of understanding the network layout before moving laterally.
   - Given the context and the actions described, it is plausible that the actors would engage in network discovery activities, such as using netstat, before or as part of their lateral movement.

Final Answer: A
