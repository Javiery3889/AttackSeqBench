To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report outlines the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FamousSparrow, a cyberespionage group.
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquired infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Utilized cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor, installed it as a service, and used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details are provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed tactics like injecting encrypted shellcode and adjusting token privileges.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information using SparrowDoor.
   - **Collection:** Able to read and exfiltrate file contents to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor for Command and Control.
   - The key points here are the use of SparrowDoor for C2 communication, the employment of HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys for encryption/decryption, and the question of scheduled data exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report confirms that FamousSparrow uses SparrowDoor for Command and Control, communicating over HTTPS with encryption/decryption via multi-byte XOR keys.
   - It also mentions that SparrowDoor is capable of reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server, which aligns with the capability to exfiltrate data.
   - However, the report does not specify the exact timing or method (e.g., scheduled transfer every 10 minutes) of data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FamousSparrow has the capability for data exfiltration through SparrowDoor.
   - The use of HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys for C2 communications indicates a level of sophistication that could support scheduled or timed exfiltration methods.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention a "scheduled transfer method every 10 minutes," the fact that SparrowDoor can exfiltrate data and the group's demonstrated sophistication in other areas suggest that such a capability is plausible.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Given the information in the CTI report and the capabilities attributed to SparrowDoor, it is reasonable to infer that FamousSparrow could have the capability to exfiltrate data on a scheduled basis, such as every 10 minutes, as part of their Command and Control operations. However, without explicit mention of the timing, this inference is based on the group's demonstrated capabilities and the functionalities of SparrowDoor.

Final Answer: A
