To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Operation Sharpshooter, which starts with reconnaissance, using job recruitment as a disguise to gather information.
   - Initial access is gained through malicious documents containing macros that inject the Sharpshooter downloader, leading to the Rising Sun implant.
   - Execution involves the macro acting as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant, which resolves libraries, downloads the second-stage payload, and executes it.
   - Persistence is achieved by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - Command and Control (C2) communication is via HTTP POST requests with encrypted and obfuscated data.
   - Exfiltration involves encrypting data with RC4 and obfuscating it with Base64 before sending it via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after ensuring persistence, the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the Rising Sun implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes.
   - Collecting the MAC address of an infected host could be considered part of gathering system information, which aligns with the implant's capabilities.
   - The report does not explicitly mention MAC address collection but implies that the implant is capable of gathering various types of system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the capabilities of the Rising Sun implant as described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that collecting system information (such as MAC addresses) could be within the scope of the implant's backdoor capabilities.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the context of the question, which asks about the likelihood of the implant collecting a MAC address before communicating with control servers.
   - **Step 4**: Given the implant's capabilities and the nature of its C2 communication, it is plausible that collecting specific system details like a MAC address could be part of its discovery activities to identify and report back on infected hosts.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the implant's capabilities for gathering system information and its backdoor functionalities, it is reasonable to assume that collecting a MAC address could be part of its activities.

Final Answer: A
