To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the APT-TOCS attack in terms of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control, possibly exploiting security vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution**: Involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities executed in memory without writing to the hard disk, using Beacon mode for communication.
     3. **Defense Evasion**: Ran in memory, avoided hard disk writing, and used multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
     4. **Lateral Movement**: Depended on network projection to move laterally within the internal network as needed.
   - The report also mentions the use of a binary file (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe", indicating a method of initial access and execution.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations, it is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.
   - The key elements here are the use of PowerShell for downloading scripts and the potential for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that APT-TOCS uses PowerShell for executing Shellcode scripts, which aligns with the question's premise of using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts.
   - The report explicitly states that APT-TOCS depends on network projection for lateral movement within the internal network, which directly answers the question about the likelihood of exhibiting lateral movement after establishing command and control operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access and execution methods used by APT-TOCS, which include the use of PowerShell.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the purpose of downloading encrypted data scripts, which is for command and control operations.
   - **Step 3**: Recall from the report that APT-TOCS is capable of lateral movement through network projection.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that since APT-TOCS uses network projection for lateral movement and has established a method for command and control (which would be a prerequisite for deciding where and how to move laterally), it is indeed likely to exhibit lateral movement within the internal network after establishing command and control operations.
   
Final Answer: A
