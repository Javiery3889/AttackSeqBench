To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to distribute the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking was used for persistence by adding registry keys for a custom backdoor.
   - The report outlines a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Sednit group, starting with initial access via spearphishing, followed by various tactics for persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after employing COM object hijacking for persistence, it is likely that the Sednit group’s operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails to gain initial access only after using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
   - Essentially, the question is inquiring about the likelihood of the group using spearphishing as an initial access method again, but this time as part of a sequence that involves using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails distributing Zebrocy components.
   - The use of COM object hijacking for persistence is a tactic that occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - The question seems to imply a sequence where after achieving persistence (through COM object hijacking), the group would use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader and then use spearphishing again for initial access. This sequence seems to loop back on itself in a way that doesn’t align with the linear progression of the attack as described in the report.
   - The report does describe the use of downloaders (written in Delphi) in the context of initial access, which continues to run in the background after the executable is launched from the spearphishing campaign. However, it does not suggest that after achieving persistence, the group would then use a new downloader to download another and then attempt initial access again via spearphishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Sednit group’s tactics, as described, follow a logical sequence from initial access to exfiltration.
   - The use of spearphishing for initial access is a precursor to the other tactics, including persistence via COM object hijacking.
   - The question’s scenario implies a recursive or looping back action within the attack sequence that isn’t directly supported by the report.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, it seems unlikely that the Sednit group would loop back to using spearphishing for initial access after already having achieved persistence, as this does not align with the described sequence of events.

Final Answer: B
