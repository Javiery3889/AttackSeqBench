To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack where the initial infection vector is a malicious email attachment that installs PoisonIvy, a backdoor Trojan.
   - The sequence of attack based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Execution**: The malicious email attachment is opened, executing a file that installs PoisonIvy.
     2. **Credential Access**: PoisonIvy is used to dump Windows cached password hashes.
     3. **Lateral Movement**: Credentials are used to move within the network.
     4. **Collection**: Intellectual property is identified and copied to internal staging servers.
     5. **Command and Control**: PoisonIvy communicates with a C&C server.
     6. **Exfiltration**: Collected data is uploaded to a remote site.
   - The "Others" section provides context about the threat actor and the campaign but does not directly relate to the initial infection vector.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it is likely that before sending phishing emails, the threat actors initiated their campaign by impersonating legitimate IT personnel in phone calls to direct victims to download a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool.
   - The question implies an initial step of social engineering via phone calls before the phishing emails were sent.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not mention any initial social engineering attempts via phone calls to install an RMM tool. Instead, it directly mentions the execution of a malicious email attachment as the initial infection vector.
   - The report focuses on the exploitation of the malicious email attachment for the initial compromise, followed by the installation of PoisonIvy and subsequent actions.
   - There is no indication in the report that the attackers used phone calls impersonating IT personnel as a precursor to sending phishing emails.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial infection vector described in the CTI report, which is the execution of a malicious email attachment.
   - **Step 2**: Compare this with the scenario presented in the question, which involves an initial step of social engineering via phone calls.
   - **Step 3**: Since the CTI report does not support the scenario of initial phone calls for social engineering to install an RMM tool, we must conclude that this was not a described part of the attack sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no evidence to support the claim that the threat actors initiated their campaign with phone calls impersonating IT personnel to direct victims to download an RMM tool before sending phishing emails.

Final Answer: B
