To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack that starts with **Initial Access** via a watering hole attack, exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
   - The **Execution** phase involves a multi-stage infection process, including the exploitation of CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation and the execution of a backdoor named SLUB.
   - **Persistence** is achieved by the SLUB backdoor through copying itself and creating a Run registry key.
   - **Privilege Escalation** is mentioned as part of the execution phase, exploiting CVE-2015-1701.
   - **Defense Evasion** tactics are used to avoid detection by security software.
   - **Discovery** involves the SLUB backdoor downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands.
   - **Collection** includes various commands for data collection, such as taking screenshots, listing files, and uploading files to the file.io website.
   - **Command and Control** is established through Slack, using hardcoded authentication tokens.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after the SLUB backdoor performs discovery, it is likely that the attackers will exfiltrate data by directly downloading cloud user data such as OneDrive files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the backdoor supports commands for data collection, including uploading files to the file.io website and creating archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
   - There is no specific mention of directly downloading cloud user data such as OneDrive files as part of the data collection or exfiltration methods used by the SLUB backdoor.
   - The focus of the backdoor's collection capabilities seems to be on local data (e.g., screenshots, files on the desktop) and not explicitly on cloud storage services like OneDrive.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on the capabilities of the SLUB backdoor, including its methods for data collection and exfiltration.
   - The question specifically asks about the exfiltration of cloud user data, which is not explicitly mentioned in the report as a capability of the SLUB backdoor.
   - Given the information provided, it seems unlikely that the primary method of exfiltration would involve directly downloading cloud user data such as OneDrive files, as this is not mentioned among the backdoor's capabilities.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely the attackers will exfiltrate data by directly downloading cloud user data such as OneDrive files as part of the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: B
