To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign involving phishing emails with malicious Word documents that deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Reconnaissance**: Involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - **Initial Access**: Achieved through phishing emails with a Microsoft Word document containing VBS macros.
   - **Defense Evasion**: A PowerShell script operates in memory, using the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraging a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
   - **Impact**: Payloads include GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware, with Ursnif capable of credential harvesting, gathering system and process information, and deploying additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, following initial access, it's likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - The key elements here are the use of a COM object for executing queries and downloading malware payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that after initial access, a PowerShell script is executed. This script uses a DCOM object (specifically, C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880) to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - The report also mentions that Ursnif malware is capable of gathering system and process information, which aligns with the idea of executing queries to gather system information.
   - The question essentially asks if the sequence of using a COM object for executing queries (to gather system information) and then downloading payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) is plausible based on the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The report confirms the use of a DCOM object in the attack sequence for executing files without saving them to disk, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Step 2**: Ursnif's capabilities include gathering system and process information, which could involve executing queries.
   - **Step 3**: The report outlines a sequence where, after initial access, a PowerShell script is executed, which then uses a DCOM object and communicates with C2 servers to download payloads, including Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, it is plausible that a COM object (as part of the PowerShell script's operation) could be involved in the process of executing queries to gather system information and subsequently downloading payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Final Answer: A
