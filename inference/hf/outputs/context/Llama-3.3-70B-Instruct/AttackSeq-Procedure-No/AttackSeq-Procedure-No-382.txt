To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: APT15 gained access using stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - **Execution**: Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) for command execution and evasion.
   - **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs persistently and communicates over DNS.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades policy settings by patching cmd.exe.
   - **Collection**: Used various tools to export data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access, APT15 is likely to use credential stuffing against the victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that APT15 already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate for remote access. This suggests they have a high level of access and do not necessarily need to perform credential stuffing to obtain valid accounts.
   - The deployment of RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS is more about maintaining access, evading defenses, and executing commands rather than obtaining initial access or valid accounts.
   - Credential stuffing is typically used to gain initial access or to expand access within a network by trying compromised credentials. Given that APT15 already has domain administrator credentials, the need for credential stuffing seems less likely as a next step before deploying their backdoors.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access methods used by APT15, which include stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the purpose of credential stuffing in the context of the attack. Credential stuffing is usually aimed at gaining access or expanding access within a network.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the necessity of credential stuffing given that APT15 already possesses domain administrator credentials, which provide a high level of network access.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the likelihood of APT15 using credential stuffing before deploying backdoors like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS, considering their existing level of access.

Given the information in the CTI report and the context provided, it seems unlikely that APT15 would need to use credential stuffing against the victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts before deploying their backdoors, as they have already achieved a significant level of access through other means.

Final Answer: B
