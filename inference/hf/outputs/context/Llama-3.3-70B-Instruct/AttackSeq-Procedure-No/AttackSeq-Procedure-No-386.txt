To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by APT15 involving several tactics:
     1. **Execution**: Deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) with unique evasion and persistence capabilities.
     2. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently.
     3. **Privilege Escalation**: Use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades command prompt execution policies.
     5. **Credential Access**: Use of Mimikatz for domain administrator credentials and theft of a VPN certificate.
     6. **Collection**: Use of various tools to export data from Active Directory, databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, APT15 would likely use valid account information (like VPN credentials) for remote access instead of deploying backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report indicates that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate, which could be used for remote network access.
   - The deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) suggests a strategy for maintaining access and executing commands within the network.
   - Using valid account information (e.g., VPN credentials) for remote access would be a more stealthy approach, potentially avoiding detection by blending in with normal network activity.
   - The backdoors, especially RoyalDNS with its DNS communication, offer a means for command and control that might be less detectable than repeated VPN logins, especially if the VPN credentials are monitored or if the login activity is anomalous.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT15's use of Mimikatz and theft of a VPN certificate indicates an interest in gaining and maintaining access to the network.
   - **Step 2**: The deployment of backdoors alongside the acquisition of valid credentials suggests a multi-faceted approach to access and control.
   - **Step 3**: Using valid account information for remote access could be a strategy to avoid detection, but the backdoors provide a direct method for command execution and data exfiltration.
   - **Step 4**: Given the sophistication of APT15 and the variety of tools and tactics employed, it's plausible that they would use both methods (valid account information and backdoors) depending on their objectives and the security posture of the target network.
   - **Conclusion**: Considering the tactics and tools used by APT15, including the theft of a VPN certificate which directly supports the use of valid account information for remote access, and the deployment of backdoors for command and control, it is likely that APT15 would use valid account information to remotely access victim networks in addition to deploying backdoors.
