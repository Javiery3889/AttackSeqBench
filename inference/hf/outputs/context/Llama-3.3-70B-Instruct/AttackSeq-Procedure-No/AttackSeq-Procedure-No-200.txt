To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the GreyEnergy group's initial access methods, including compromising public-facing web services and using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - After initial access, the attackers use "GreyEnergy mini" to map the network and collect passwords, aiming to obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - Tools like Nmap and Mimikatz are used for network mapping and credential collection.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after compromising a computer and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz, the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving initial compromise, network mapping, credential collection, and potentially lateral movement or deployment of additional malware/tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker.
   - However, it does describe the group's interest in obtaining domain administrator privileges to control the whole network, which implies a need for tools or methods to distribute malware or tools across the network.
   - PDQ Deploy is a tool that can be used for deploying software across a network, and in the context of a cyber attack, it could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as deploying ransomware like AvosLocker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the GreyEnergy group's goals and methods as described. They aim to gain control over a network, which involves initial access, network mapping, and credential collection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that to achieve their goals, especially after obtaining domain administrator privileges, the group would need to deploy tools or malware across the network.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the potential use of PDQ Deploy as a means to distribute AvosLocker or other tools. While the report does not explicitly mention PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker, the use of such a tool aligns with the group's objectives of network control and potential ransomware deployment.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the answer choices. Given the context and the group's objectives, using a tool like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement or deployment of additional malware is plausible, especially in the context of a targeted ransomware attack.

**Final Answer: A**
