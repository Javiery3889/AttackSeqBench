To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a watering hole attack targeting iOS users, leading to the download and execution of the lightSpy malware.
   - **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a watering hole attack exploiting iOS vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution**: The lightSpy malware installs a modular backdoor for remote command execution and file manipulation.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses a modular design, module updates, and exploits a Safari bug and a kernel exploit to gain root privileges.
   - **Collection**: The malware collects and exfiltrates a wide range of data, including hardware information, contacts, text messages, call history, WiFi information, browser history, and user location, with specific focus on messenger apps like WeChat, QQ, and Telegram.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing communication with its C&C server, the lightSpy malware is likely to first perform data collection targeting specific types of data.
   - The question focuses on the sequence of actions after the malware has established its control and communication channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report clearly states that the lightSpy malware's modules are designed for data exfiltration, including the types of data mentioned in the question (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and data from messenger apps like WeChat, QQ, and Telegram).
   - Given that the malware is designed to collect and exfiltrate this specific data and considering the modular design for targeted data collection, it is logical that after establishing control and communication, the malware would proceed to collect this data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the lightSpy malware, which is to collect and exfiltrate specific data from infected iOS devices.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the malware's design includes modules specifically aimed at collecting the mentioned data types.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that establishing communication with C&C servers is crucial for module updates and data exfiltration, which precedes or is concurrent with the data collection process.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that given the malware's purpose and design, it is highly likely that after leveraging C&C server locations, the malware would proceed to collect the targeted data.

Final Answer: A
