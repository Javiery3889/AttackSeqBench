To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Dropping Elephant threat actor.
   - The sequence of attack based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
     2. **Initial Access**: Compromising victims through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents or watering hole attacks.
     3. **Execution**: Using a backdoor that is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell scripts.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: The backdoor uses encoded blobs decoded to PowerShell scripts to evade detection.
     5. **Credential Access**: Stealing user credentials, including Google Chrome credentials.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C2 server, which involves pinging the server at regular intervals and hiding encrypted C2 server locations.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the backdoor downloading encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion after a file-stealer module collects files.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves file collection (which could be part of **Credential Access** or **Collection** tactics) followed by defense evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts as part of its **Execution** and **Defense Evasion** tactics.
   - The question implies a scenario where after collecting files ( possibly as part of **Collection** or **Credential Access**), the backdoor would engage in **Defense Evasion** by downloading and executing PowerShell scripts.
   - Given the tactics described, it is plausible that after collecting sensitive information (like files with specific extensions), the threat actor would attempt to maintain access and evade detection, which aligns with the use of encoded blobs and PowerShell scripts for defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Dropping Elephant's backdoor is known to download additional malware and use encoded blobs for defense evasion.
   - The action of collecting files could be a precursor to further malicious activities that require evasion techniques.
   - The use of PowerShell scripts for defense evasion is a tactic employed by the group.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that after collecting files, the backdoor would likely engage in defense evasion tactics, which include downloading encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.

Final Answer: A
