To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes two attack campaigns, Moafee and DragonOK, which use similar TTPs.
   - Initial access is primarily through spear-phishing emails with tailored attachments.
   - The groups use custom-built backdoors and RATs (like CT/NewCT) and publicly available RATs (like PoisonIvy) for maintaining access.
   - Persistence is achieved through registry entries by the CT/NewCT implant.
   - Defense evasion techniques include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, Moafee and DragonOK are likely to use email for Command and Control (C2) via an Office macro.
   - This involves understanding the groups' methods for initial access and their capabilities for command and control operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails, which may include Office documents.
   - However, the question is about the method used for C2 after achieving persistence, not the initial access method.
   - The report details the use of backdoors and RATs for maintaining access but does not specifically mention using email with Office macros for C2 operations after initial access.
   - Given the groups' sophistication and use of various evasion techniques, it's plausible they could use multiple methods for C2, but the report does not explicitly state the use of email with Office macros for this purpose.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary method of initial access and the tools used for persistence and C2. The groups use spear-phishing for initial access and custom backdoors/RATs for persistence and C2.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the possibility of using email with Office macros for C2. While the groups use emails for initial access, the report does not specify this method for C2 operations.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the groups' capabilities and the context provided. The groups are sophisticated and use various evasion techniques, suggesting they could employ multiple C2 methods.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, there's no explicit indication that Moafee and DragonOK use email with Office macros for C2 operations after achieving persistence. The report focuses more on their initial access methods and the tools used for maintaining access and evasion.

Final Answer: B
