To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack that starts with **Initial Access** via malicious emails containing a weaponized RTF document. This document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop a downloader file named svchost.exe.
   - The **Command and Control** section mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with its C&C servers.
   - The report also mentions that some modules of the malware lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the MSIL/Crimson malware establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from a specified IP address and port.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     1. Initial access through a weaponized document.
     2. Establishing command and control.
     3. Executing on the victim's machine.
     4. Downloading the full RAT component.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report confirms that initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document, which matches the first step in the question.
   - It also states that the malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication, aligning with the second step in the question.
   - The report mentions the malware's ability to download additional payloads (such as the full RAT component) after initial infection, which supports the third and fourth steps in the question.
   - The specific action of downloading the full RAT component from a specified IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001) is not directly mentioned in the report but is consistent with the behavior of the malware as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access method described in the report matches the first part of the question, involving a weaponized RTF document.
   - **Step 2**: The report confirms the use of a custom TCP protocol for C&C, which aligns with the second part of the question.
   - **Step 3**: The execution on the victim's machine and the attempt to download additional components (like the RAT) are consistent with the malware's modular design and behavior as described.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the details provided in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after initial access, the MSIL/Crimson malware would establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol and then proceed with executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component.

Final Answer: A
