To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur.
   - The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Execution involves a custom loader exploiting a side-loading vulnerability to load the Korplug variant.
   - Persistence is established through creating a hidden directory and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry.
   - Defense evasion techniques include control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption.
   - Discovery involves collecting system information.
   - Collection includes gathering data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - Exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant will use ICMP in C2 (Command and Control) communications after collecting data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report specifies that exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.
   - There is no mention of ICMP being used in C2 communications or data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the method of exfiltration mentioned in the report. The report mentions a custom protocol using TCP for exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Determine if ICMP is mentioned in the context of C2 communications or exfiltration. ICMP is not mentioned.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the answer choices based on the information from the report. Since the report does not mention ICMP and specifically mentions TCP for exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that ICMP is not used.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the CTI report, the Korplug variant does not use ICMP for C2 communications after collecting data, as the specified method of exfiltration involves TCP.

Final Answer: B
