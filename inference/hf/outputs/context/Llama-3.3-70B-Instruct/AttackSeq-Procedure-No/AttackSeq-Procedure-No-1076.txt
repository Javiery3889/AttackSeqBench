To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report describes a cyber attack where a system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which then deletes itself.
   - The backdoor installer drops several files, including a malicious loader, and uses the BITSadmin command-line tool to launch a legitimate Windows Gadget tool (sidebar.exe).
   - The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking to launch dllhost.exe and injects a DLL backdoor into it.
   - The backdoor connects to command-and-control (C&C) servers using SSL protocol after loading and decrypting an encrypted configuration file.
   - The report mentions the use of exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware, exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 for initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after exploiting specific vulnerabilities to gain initial access, it is likely that various social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report does not directly mention the use of social media channels for spearphishing before the system configuration file drops the backdoor installer.
   - It does mention the use of exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents, which could be delivered via email or other means, but it does not specify the use of social media for spearphishing.
   - The report focuses more on the technical aspects of the malware and its behavior post-exploitation rather than the initial vectors used for phishing or social engineering.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a sequence of events starting with exploitation of vulnerabilities, potentially followed by spearphishing via social media, and then the dropping of a backdoor installer.
   - However, the CTI report does not provide direct evidence or mention of social media being used as a vector for spearphishing before the backdoor installer is dropped.
   - The report's focus is on the technical details of the attack post-exploitation, suggesting that the initial access vector (whether through social media, email, or other means) is not the primary concern of the report.

**Final Answer: B**
