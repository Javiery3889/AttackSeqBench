To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack campaign named Operation Earth Kitsune.
   - **Initial Access**: Watering hole tactics were used, exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to deliver malware.
   - **Execution**: Malware execution involved exploiting Chrome and Internet Explorer vulnerabilities to download and execute additional malware.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: A PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Malware checked for security software to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery**: SLUB malware interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information and capture screenshots.
   - **Command and Control**: SLUB malware communicated with the Mattermost server for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information and capturing screenshots, the SLUB malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the interaction between the SLUB malware and the Mattermost server under the Discovery phase, where it collects system information and captures screenshots.
   - The report mentions that the collected information (system information and screenshots) is sent back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - Although the report does not explicitly mention an "Exfiltration" phase, the action of sending collected data back to the Mattermost server (which acts as a C2 server in this context) implies data exfiltration.
   - Given that the malware variant is designed to interact with the C2 server for real-time updates and has the capability to send back collected information, it is reasonable to infer that the malware is capable of exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The SLUB malware's interaction with the Mattermost server includes collecting system information and capturing screenshots.
   - This information is sent back to the Mattermost server, which is controlled by the attackers.
   - The action of sending back collected data aligns with the concept of exfiltration, even though the report does not explicitly label it as such.
   - Therefore, based on the capabilities and behaviors described, it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
