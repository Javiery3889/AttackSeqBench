To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence as described in the CTI report and analyze the question in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The adversaries start by gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods such as scanning perimeter devices and social media data collection. This step is about information gathering and does not involve direct interaction with the target's internal systems.

2. **Initial Access**: The report mentions that adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) after employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. This step involves the delivery and installation of the malware.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The establishment of a C2 connection is mentioned as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files. Once permissions to execute macros are granted by employees, the malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests.

Given this sequence, the question asks whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Analysis**:
- The CTI report indicates that the establishment of a C2 connection happens as part of the malware's execution routine after it has been installed on the network. This implies that the communication with C2 servers occurs after the malware has been installed, not before.
- The installation of the malware (BlackEnergy 3) requires employee interaction (enabling macros), which is a crucial step for the malware to establish itself on the network.
- The C2 communication is a post-installation activity, allowing the adversaries to control the malware and potentially deliver additional payloads.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the attack sequence described, it is not accurate to say that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 establish communication with Command-and-Control servers before being installed on the network. The communication with C2 servers is a step that occurs after the malware has been installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Final Answer: B**
