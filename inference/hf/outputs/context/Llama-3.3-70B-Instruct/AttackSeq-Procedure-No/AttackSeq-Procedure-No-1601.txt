To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report mentions MuddyWater's campaign using compromised servers in targeted countries (like Pakistan and China) to host malicious code for the second stage of attacks.
   - It specifies the use of a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) file that communicates with a specific IP address, sending encoded base64 output about processes on the compromised system.
   - The report also mentions the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office vulnerability, as part of their attack vector, which is used to download a malicious JPG file containing a macro.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via CVE-2017-0199, MuddyWater would only utilize command and control (C2) servers in Pakistan and China to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems.
   - The question focuses on the geographical location of the C2 servers used by MuddyWater after the initial compromise.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report does mention the use of servers in Pakistan and China for hosting malicious code and communicating with compromised systems.
   - However, it does not explicitly state that these are the only locations used for C2 servers. The report provides examples of servers in these countries but does not rule out the use of servers in other locations.
   - The question's phrasing ("is it likely that they will only then utilize") implies an exclusivity that is not directly supported by the information given in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the initial access method - MuddyWater uses CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access.
   - **Step 2:** Determine the role of C2 servers - The report indicates that compromised servers in targeted countries are used for the second stage of attacks, implying these servers are used for C2 purposes.
   - **Step 3:** Evaluate geographical limitations - The report provides examples of C2 servers in Pakistan and China but does not explicitly limit their C2 operations to only these countries.
   - **Step 4:** Consider the implications of the question - The question asks about the exclusivity of using C2 servers in Pakistan and China, which the report does not directly address.

**Final Answer: B**
