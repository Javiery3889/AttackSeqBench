To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet exploited the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability through malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** Involved running malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers for persistence and control.
   - **Persistence:** Achieved through kernel-mode drivers and modifying system files and registry keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Utilized zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed rootkit functionality, digital certificates, and system library patches to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Propagated through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) and shared resources.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after exploiting specific vulnerabilities for lateral movement, Stuxnet would use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report mentions that during the **Execution** phase, Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers but does not specify the protocol used (e.g., FTP, HTTP, etc.).
   - The question specifically asks about using the FTP protocol for C2 communication after lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report details various tactics and techniques used by Stuxnet, including exploitation of vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - It mentions communication with C&C servers but does not explicitly state the use of FTP for this purpose.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Stuxnet, including its use of kernel-mode drivers, rootkit functionality, and exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, it's plausible that its C2 communication could utilize various protocols, potentially including FTP, to maintain stealth and flexibility.
   - However, the report does not provide explicit information on the protocols used for C2 communication, making it necessary to consider the typical behaviors of advanced malware like Stuxnet.

5. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Without explicit mention of FTP in the CTI report for C2 communication, and considering the advanced and stealthy nature of Stuxnet, it's reasonable to consider that Stuxnet might use various protocols for C2 communication, including potentially FTP, but the report does not directly support this conclusion.

**Final Answer: B**
