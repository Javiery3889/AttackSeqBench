To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the Stuxnet worm's attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Initial Access**: Stuxnet exploited the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability through malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
     2. **Execution**: Ran malicious code, including loading kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components to inject code into processes and hide files.
     3. **Persistence**: Installed kernel-mode drivers and modified system files and registry keys for persistence.
     4. **Privilege Escalation**: Used zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
     5. **Defense Evasion**: Employed rootkit functionality, used stolen digital certificates, and patched system libraries to evade detection.
     6. **Lateral Movement**: Propagated through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) and scanning network shares.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after communicating with its C&C servers, Stuxnet is likely to exploit specific vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     1. Communication with C&C servers.
     2. Lateral movement within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that Stuxnet does indeed communicate with C&C servers as part of its execution phase, which includes building and running its dropper, spreading through the network, and communicating with C&C servers.
   - After establishing communication, the report mentions that Stuxnet spreads itself across networked machines using the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability and the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability as part of its lateral movement tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify Stuxnet's capability to communicate with C&C servers, which is mentioned in the execution phase.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that lateral movement is a subsequent action that involves exploiting vulnerabilities such as MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler.
   - **Step 3**: Since the report explicitly states that Stuxnet uses these vulnerabilities for lateral movement, it is logical to conclude that after communicating with its C&C servers, Stuxnet would indeed exploit these vulnerabilities to move laterally within the network.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the nature of Stuxnet's behavior, it is likely that Stuxnet will exploit the mentioned vulnerabilities for lateral movement after communicating with its C&C servers.

Final Answer: A
