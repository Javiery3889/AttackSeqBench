To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted documents.
   - **Execution**: Involves droppers and deployment of various tools.
   - **Persistence**: APT28 changes file timestamps to hide files.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Uses a tool to exploit a vulnerability for system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool.
   - **Credential Access**: Deploys a password dumping tool.
   - **Discovery**: Scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems using bots.
   - **Collection**: Deploys modules for data collection.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates via HTTP with possible encryption.
   - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data like emails and files.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access, APT28 is likely to probe potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots **only after** discovering the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that after initial access, APT28 deploys various tools for execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, and then moves on to discovery. 
   - The discovery phase involves scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, which implies that probing for potential victims' identity information could be part of or follow the discovery phase.
   - However, the question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence where probing for identity information happens after the discovery phase, using geographically distributed scan bots. The report does mention scanning and identifying vulnerable systems but does not explicitly state that this is when they probe for identity information using geographically distributed scan bots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT28's initial access involves spear phishing.
   - The discovery phase includes scanning IP ranges, which could be interpreted as including probing for potential victims' systems or information.
   - The question implies a specific method (geographically distributed scan bots) for probing identity information after the discovery phase.
   - The report does not explicitly state that probing for identity information occurs after the discovery phase using the specified method.

Given the information in the CTI report and the question's specifics, the most accurate answer based on the provided details would be:

**Final Answer: B**
