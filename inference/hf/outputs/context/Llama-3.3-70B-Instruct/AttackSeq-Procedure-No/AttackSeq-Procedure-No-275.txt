To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Korplug variant in the Mustang Panda campaign.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: The campaign involves phishing and possibly watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate executable.
   - **Persistence**: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory, copying necessary files, and setting up either a scheduled task or a registry entry to run at boot.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques are observed.
   - **Discovery**: Korplug collects system information, including uptime, Windows version, locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Collection**: It collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including file attributes, content, and metadata.
   - **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol involving TCP messages with a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after performing data exfiltration, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports only after collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The CTI report indicates that data exfiltration is performed using a custom protocol with TCP messages. This implies that communication with C&C servers for exfiltration purposes does indeed involve a custom protocol.
   - The report also details that Korplug collects extensive data from various sources (local system, removable media, network shared drives) before exfiltrating it. This collection step precedes exfiltration in the logical sequence of the attack.
   - The question essentially asks if the exfiltration (and by extension, the communication with C&C servers for this purpose) happens after the collection of data, which aligns with the sequence described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the sequence of TTPs in the CTI report, focusing on collection and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Understand that the collection of data from various sources is a precursor to exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that exfiltration is performed using a custom TCP-based protocol, which implies communication with C&C servers.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that the sequence of collecting data and then exfiltrating it using a custom protocol aligns with the tactics described in the report.

**Final Answer**: A
