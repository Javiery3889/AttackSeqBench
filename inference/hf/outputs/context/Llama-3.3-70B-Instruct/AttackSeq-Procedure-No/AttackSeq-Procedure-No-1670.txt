To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI report**:
   - The report describes the attack sequence by the Dark Seoul attackers, also known as Operation Troy, using the TDrop2 malware.
   - The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Malware used for basic reconnaissance.
     2. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
     3. **Execution**: TDrop2 malware executes a legitimate Windows executable and uses process hollowing to inject malicious code.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: TDrop2 uses process hollowing and obfuscates its payload by disguising it as an image file.
     5. **Discovery**: Malware collects system and network information.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after performing discovery activities, the TDrop2 malware will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     1. Discovery activities.
     2. Using Google Drive for C2.
     3. Communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does mention that the malware uses a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine, which aligns with the use of encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
   - However, the report does not explicitly mention the use of Google Drive for C2 communications. It mentions that the C2 servers used in the recent attacks were compromised websites.
   - Given the information provided, there's no direct evidence in the CTI report to support the claim that TDrop2 malware uses Google Drive for C2 communications before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and TTPs mentioned in the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question for the specific sequence of TTPs it asks about.
   - **Step 3**: Compare the information from the CTI report with the question's requirements.
   - **Step 4**: Since the CTI report does not mention the use of Google Drive for C2 communications but does discuss the use of custom base64 encoding for payload obfuscation, we must conclude based on the information provided.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the lack of direct evidence supporting the use of Google Drive for C2 in the provided CTI report, the most accurate answer based on the information given is that it is unlikely the report supports this specific sequence of actions.

Final Answer: B
