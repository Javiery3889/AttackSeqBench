To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Konni APT Group, starting with the delivery of an ISO file containing malicious scripts.
   - The attack sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access**: Delivering an ISO file.
     2. **Execution**: Running various scripts and batch files, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
     3. **Persistence**: Scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscating scripts and deleting files after execution.
     5. **Discovery**: Collecting system information using 'versioninfo.bat'.
     6. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C2 server via 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat'.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data using 'unactivate.vbs'.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after discovering system information, the Konni APT Group is likely to access the victim's webcam, record video, and then exfiltrate this information using 'unactivate.vbs'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the group's actions post-discovery, focusing on exfiltrating collected system information.
   - There is no mention of accessing webcams or recording video in the provided report.
   - The report emphasizes data exfiltration and espionage as the group's objectives but does not specify webcam access as part of their tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the attack sequence and objectives of the Konni APT Group from the CTI report.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the question for any actions not explicitly mentioned in the report, such as accessing the victim's webcam.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the report's described actions and objectives align with the question's scenario.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, there is no indication that the Konni APT Group's tactics include accessing the victim's webcam and recording video as part of their attack sequence. The report focuses on system information collection and exfiltration, not on accessing specific hardware like webcams.

Final Answer: B
