To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The threat actors, identified as Patchwork, conduct spear phishing campaigns. They use unique tracking links to identify which recipients open their email messages. This step is about gathering information and preparing for the attack.

2. **Initial Access**: The threat actors send spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750. The goal of this exploit is to drop and execute QuasarRAT on the victim's system. This is the initial infection vector.

3. **Persistence**: After the initial infection, the malware (QuasarRAT) creates a directory, unpacks itself, and sets up a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the system.

4. **Command and Control**: The malware beacons back to the command and control server, indicating that the system is under the control of the threat actors.

Given this sequence, the question asks if recipients are likely to receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery **only after** getting infected with QuasarRAT.

Based on the report, the answer is **No**. The spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 are the initial infection vector, not a post-infection activity. The recipients receive these emails as part of the initial attack to infect them with QuasarRAT, not after they are already infected.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The CTI report outlines a sequence starting with reconnaissance, followed by initial access via spear phishing and exploitation, then persistence, and finally command and control.
- The exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 and the delivery of QuasarRAT are part of the initial access tactic, aimed at infecting the victim's system.
- The question inquires about the timing of receiving spear phishing emails relative to the infection with QuasarRAT.
- Given the sequence of events, it's clear that the spear phishing emails are used to infect the system initially, not after the system is already infected.

**Final Answer: B**
