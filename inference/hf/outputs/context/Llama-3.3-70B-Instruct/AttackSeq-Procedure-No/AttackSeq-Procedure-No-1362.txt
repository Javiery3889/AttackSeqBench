To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the VERMIN malware, a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that uses HTTP encapsulated SOAP for command and control.
   - **Initial Access**: The malware is initially executed, often through a decoy document, and checks the system's language settings.
   - **Execution**: After execution, it collects system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and installed anti-virus software) and sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Persistence**: Establishes persistence through a scheduled task and saves parameters to a file named `settings.dat`.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Uses ConfuserEx for obfuscation and avoids installing its keylogger if anti-virus software is detected.
   - **Discovery**: Collects system information, including checking for anti-virus software via WMI queries.
   - **Command and Control**: Communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting system information, the VERMIN malware will utilize tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a specific folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that the malware collects system information using WMI queries, which aligns with the premise of the question.
   - However, the report specifically mentions that the malware installs a keylogger component unless anti-virus software is detected. There is no mention of capturing mouse movements as an alternative to keylogging.
   - The keylogger component's purpose is to capture keystrokes, and there's an implication of storing data, but the specifics of storing "keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under %appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings" are not directly mentioned in the report. The report does mention saving parameters to `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`, but this is related to the malware's configuration and persistence, not specifically to the keylogger's output.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question seems to imply an either-or scenario regarding the malware's behavior after collecting system information.
   - The report does not support the idea that the malware captures mouse movements as an alternative to keylogging.
   - The malware's behavior, as described, involves collecting system information and then potentially installing a keylogger if no anti-virus is detected, not capturing mouse movements.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI report, the answer to whether the malware will utilize tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data is "No", as there is no indication of mouse movement capture in the report, and the keylogger's functionality is mentioned as part of the malware's capabilities.

Final Answer: B
