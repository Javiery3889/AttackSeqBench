To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber attack by the MuddyWater campaign.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing an embedded macro. This macro, when enabled, executes PowerShell scripts leading to a backdoor payload without downloading additional files.
     2. **Execution**: The macro triggers the Document_Open() event, which executes a malicious routine involving three main functions, including one that constructs and executes PowerShell commands and scripts.
     3. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script decodes its contents and executes another encoded PowerShell script, dropping components into the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory. The main PowerShell file, invoker.ps1, uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.
     4. **Command and Control**: The PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server for various malicious activities.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion, it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence. This is after gaining initial access through a malicious Microsoft Word document with encoded PowerShell scripts executed via macro-triggered events.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in question involves:
     1. Initial access through a malicious document.
     2. Execution of encoded PowerShell scripts.
     3. Decoding scripts for persistence (dropping components like invoker.ps1).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the attack involves embedding a malicious macro in a Microsoft Word document, which executes PowerShell scripts. These scripts are encoded within the document itself.
   - The report further explains that the PowerShell script decodes its contents and executes another encoded script, leading to the dropping of components necessary for persistence (e.g., invoker.ps1).
   - The question essentially asks if this sequence of events—using encoded scripts for initial access and then decoding them for persistence—is a likely behavior for the campaign.
   - Given the details in the CTI report, the campaign does indeed use encoded scripts within a malicious document for initial access and then decodes these scripts as part of its persistence mechanism, dropping components like invoker.ps1.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method described in the CTI report, which involves a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded macro executing encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the execution and persistence tactics, which involve decoding these scripts to drop necessary components for persistence.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the question essentially describes this sequence of events and asks for its likelihood.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that based on the CTI report, the described sequence of events (using encoded scripts for initial access and then decoding them for persistence) is indeed part of the campaign's tactics.
