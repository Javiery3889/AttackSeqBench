To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations, with the return of Bankshot malware.
   - **Resource Development:** Bankshot implants are distributed from a malicious domain, and these implants are variations of earlier forms, giving attackers full capability on a victim's system.
   - **Initial Access:** Financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - **Persistence:** Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The implant evades detection and can wipe files.
   - **Command and Control:** The implants communicate with control servers, which are disguised as ZIP files.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after initial access through spear phishing, the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files before being executed.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI report indicates that initial access is gained through spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit.
   - After the initial access, the Bankshot implant is executed, which is designed to persist on the victim's network and can communicate with control servers.
   - The implants (DLLs) are indeed disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers, which aligns with the question's details.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access vector is through spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document.
   - The exploit (CVE-2018-4878) in the document allows the execution of arbitrary code, such as the Bankshot implant.
   - The Bankshot implant, once executed, is designed to communicate with control servers.
   - These control servers are associated with the implant disguised as ZIP files, as per the report.

Given the sequence of events and the characteristics of the Bankshot implant, it is logical to conclude that after initial access is gained, the implant would indeed communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files as part of its operation.

**Final Answer: A**
