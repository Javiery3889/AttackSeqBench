To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack sequence starting with Initial Access via a zero-day exploit (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome.
   - The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal.
   - The attack targeted 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer.
   - After the initial access, the malware achieved persistence through the Windows Task Scheduler and communicated with a command and control (C2) server for further instructions.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if it's likely that attackers used heap spraying techniques before inserting malicious JavaScript code into a news portal to exploit CVE-2019-13720.
   - Heap spraying is a technique used to facilitate the exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities by placing malicious code in areas of memory where it is more likely to be executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention heap spraying as part of the attack sequence.
   - However, the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2019-13720) suggests a sophisticated attack that could potentially involve heap spraying to increase the chances of successful exploitation, especially since the vulnerability is related to the browser.
   - The report focuses on the delivery mechanism (waterhole attack) and the subsequent actions (persistence, C2 communication), but the specifics of the exploit technique (e.g., heap spraying) are not detailed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack vector involves exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome, which could plausibly involve advanced exploitation techniques.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that heap spraying is a common technique used in browser exploitation to increase the reliability of exploits, especially for vulnerabilities that require precise memory manipulation.
   - **Step 3**: Note that while the CTI report does not explicitly mention heap spraying, the use of a zero-day exploit suggests a high level of sophistication that could include such techniques.
   - **Step 4**: Given the context and the nature of the vulnerability being exploited, it is reasonable to consider that heap spraying could have been part of the exploitation process, even if not explicitly stated.

**Final Answer: A**
