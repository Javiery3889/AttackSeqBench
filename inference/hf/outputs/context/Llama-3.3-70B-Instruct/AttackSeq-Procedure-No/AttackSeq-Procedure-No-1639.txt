To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report**:
   - **Initial Access**: The adversary gains access through credential stuffing or password spraying attacks, leveraging previously breached usernames and passwords.
   - **Execution**: They install Cobalt Strike, using it to execute commands and maintain access.
   - **Persistence**: The adversary achieves persistence by loading the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory, particularly on systems with high uptimes like servers.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: They escalate privileges through password spraying against domain admin accounts or by moving laterally to systems with domain admins logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access**: Achieved through brute force, credential stuffing, or password spraying.
   - **Discovery**: The adversary uses various tools like PsLogList for account discovery and Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement**: They use Cobalt Strike's built-in methods (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM) to move laterally, aiming to reach a domain controller and identify data of interest.
   - **Command and Control**: Cobalt Strike is used for managing compromised systems, with the command and control channel encapsulated in HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration**: Small amounts of data are exfiltrated through the command and control channel, while larger amounts are exfiltrated using a custom-built tool to cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

2. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after identifying target systems and data of interest through Cobalt Strike's lateral movement capabilities, the adversary is likely to exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying results of the discovery phase (like file and directory lists from network shared drives).

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The CTI report indicates that the adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and to identify data of interest.
   - For exfiltration, the report mentions that small amounts of data (like account details) are exfiltrated through the command and control channel, while larger amounts (such as mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property) are exfiltrated using a custom tool to cloud storage services.
   - The question essentially asks if the adversary exfiltrates data to cloud storage before or after the discovery phase. Given the report's details, the adversary's primary goal after discovery is to exfiltrate the identified data of interest, which includes copying file and directory lists from network shared drives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery.
   - The discovery phase involves identifying data of interest, which could include file and directory lists from network shared drives.
   - The exfiltration method depends on the amount of data: small amounts are exfiltrated through the command and control channel, and larger amounts are exfiltrated to cloud storage services.
   - The question implies a sequence where the adversary has already identified data of interest and is deciding on the exfiltration method.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the information in the CTI report, the adversary's method of exfiltrating larger amounts of data (such as those obtained from network shared drives) involves using a custom tool to upload the data to cloud storage services after the data has been identified and prepared (compressed, encrypted, staged).
   - Therefore, it is likely that the adversary would exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services after copying results of the discovery phase, as this is part of their method for handling larger data sets.

**Final Answer: B**
