To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the CTI report in relation to the question asked.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report outlines SideCopy's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Key points include:
   - **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a complex infection chain.
   - **Execution**: They deploy various RATs (Remote Access Trojans) and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - **Collection**: SideCopy utilizes modular plugins for specific tasks like file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Exfiltration**: Their primary goal is credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Indian government, and they deploy njRAT malware for this purpose.

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after gaining initial access and delivering payloads, SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The report mentions the use of keyloggers, which could imply capturing keyboard inputs but does not directly mention capturing mouse movements.
   - API hooking is a technique that could be used for various purposes, including credential harvesting, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - The deployment of njRAT malware is specifically for credential harvesting, and the report highlights the use of plugins for tasks like keylogging and browser password stealing, which are directly related to credential harvesting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access** is achieved through malicious LNK files, which aligns with the question's premise.
   - The **Execution** phase involves deploying RATs and plugins, including those for credential stealing and keylogging, which are relevant to the question's context.
   - While **Collection** involves modular plugins for tasks like keylogging, there's no explicit mention of capturing mouse movements or performing API hooking as a precursor to deploying njRAT.
   - The primary goal of **Exfiltration** is credential harvesting, for which njRAT is deployed, but the specific techniques of mouse movement capture or API hooking are not detailed in the report.

Given the information provided and focusing on the specific question about capturing mouse movements or performing API hooking before deploying njRAT malware, the report does not explicitly mention these actions as part of SideCopy's TTPs leading up to the deployment of njRAT for credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: B**
