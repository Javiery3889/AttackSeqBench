To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes Agrius' tactics starting with **Initial Access** through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Execution** involves deploying custom malware like the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware.
   - **Persistence** is achieved through webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion** techniques include using obfuscated webshells and the backdoor's ability to update itself and delete traces.
   - **Lateral Movement** is facilitated by webshells tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts.
   - **Command and Control** involves the 'IPsec Helper' communicating with C2 servers over HTTP for various commands.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and the 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers for sending recon information or downloading files.
   - The question implies a sequence of actions where data destruction activities (using 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD') occur before the 'IPsec Helper' engages in its primary functions as described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware in the context provided.
   - The report focuses on the group's methods for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control, highlighting the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and webshells.
   - The question introduces 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as part of data destruction activities, which is not directly addressed in the provided report sequence.
   - Given the report's focus on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to gaining access, maintaining presence, and exfiltrating data, the introduction of specific data destruction tools ('Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD') as a precursor to the 'IPsec Helper's' primary functions seems out of sequence with the described TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines Agrius' methods for accessing, persisting within, and communicating from a target network.
   - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a key tool for these activities, including awaiting commands from C2 servers.
   - The question posits the deployment of 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' before the 'IPsec Helper' engages with C2 servers, which is not supported by the sequence of events described in the report.
   - Given the information provided and the focus on the 'IPsec Helper's' role in the attack sequence, it's reasonable to conclude that the deployment of 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as described does not fit the outlined sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: B
