To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a variant of the Poison Ivy (PIVY) Remote Access Trojan (RAT), specifically a new variant known as SPIVY.
   - **Initial Access**: SPIVY uses DLL sideloading and drops several files, including a decoy document, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll, and the PIVY shellcode file.
   - **Execution**: It executes malicious actions by copying rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and running it with the path to the DLL.
   - **Persistence**: SPIVY installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The malware uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection, including changes to how its Command & Control (C2) servers are specified.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks whether, after communicating with C2 servers, the PIVY variant is likely to evade defenses by using DLL sideloading and modifying its configuration.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers like webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report details the PIVY variant's use of DLL sideloading as a method for defense evasion, which aligns with the question's description of evasive tactics.
   - The report also mentions modifications to the malware's configuration to confuse tools that parse configuration data, which matches the question's reference to modifying its configuration to evade defenses.
   - The communication with C2 servers using application layer protocols is a plausible step in the malware's operation, given its need to receive commands and send stolen data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading for defense evasion, as stated in the report.
   - **Step 2**: The malware modifies its configuration to evade detection, which includes changes to how C2 servers are specified.
   - **Step 3**: The question's scenario, involving communication with C2 servers and then evading defenses, aligns with the tactics described in the CTI report.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report and the details in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that after communicating with C2 servers, the PIVY variant would indeed attempt to evade defenses by using DLL sideloading and modifying its configuration.

Final Answer: A
