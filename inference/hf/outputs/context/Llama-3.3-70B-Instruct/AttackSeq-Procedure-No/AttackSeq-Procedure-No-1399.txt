To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report details the activities of FIN13, a threat actor targeting Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - The tactics used by FIN13 include:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: Mapping victim networks, capturing credentials.
     2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     3. **Execution**: Employing tools like JSPRAT for command execution and file upload/download.
     4. **Persistence**: Using trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK, and email communications for command and control.
     5. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilizing tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     6. **Defense Evasion**: Employing passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities.
     7. **Credential Access**: Dumping LSASS process memory, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials.
     8. **Discovery**: Using native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
     9. **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI to execute commands remotely and move laterally.
     10. **Collection**: Collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely.
     11. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely.
   - The key activities mentioned in the question are:
     - Exfiltrating data over web services.
     - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it.
     - Using proxies for communication and command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know FIN13 uses various tactics for command and control, including email communications with a backdoor called MAILSLOT and custom backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - The report also mentions the use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration, which aligns with the question's context of exfiltrating data over web services.
   - FIN13's use of proxies for network traffic proxying is mentioned in the context of employing JSPRAT, indicating that proxy use is part of their toolkit for command and control and potentially for evading detection during various stages of their operation, not limited to after data collection and archiving.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify FIN13's methods for command and control and data exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that FIN13 uses proxies as part of their toolkit, specifically for network traffic proxying with tools like JSPRAT.
   - **Step 3**: Understand that the question implies a specific sequence where proxy use is considered only after certain actions (data collection and archiving), which may not accurately reflect FIN13's flexible and adaptive use of tactics.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude that FIN13's use of proxies is not strictly limited to the sequence implied by the question, given their broader use of proxies for evasion and command and control throughout their operations.

**Final Answer: B**
