To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes RIG EK's operation, starting with Resource Development, where it uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands.
   - It then details Initial Access, where RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising or compromised websites, aligning with the Drive-by Compromise technique.
   - Execution involves running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - Defense Evasion techniques include using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and an Antivirus testing feature.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after RIG EK's exploit server returns encrypted exploit code, it is likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.
   - The key elements here are the use of encrypted exploit code and the potential use of proxy servers for evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - From the CTI report, we know that RIG EK uses proxy servers as part of its Defense Evasion techniques to make infections harder to detect.
   - The question implies a scenario where RIG EK has already established a level of interaction with the victim machine (by returning encrypted exploit code), which suggests it is in the process of or has already compromised the machine.
   - Given that proxy servers are mentioned as a method used by RIG EK for Defense Evasion, and considering the context of the question, it is reasonable to infer that proxy servers would indeed be used to make the subsequent infection (after the exploit code has been returned) harder to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify RIG EK's methods for Defense Evasion, which include the use of proxy servers.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the context of the question, which involves the return of encrypted exploit code, a step that would precede or be part of the infection process.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the use of proxy servers is a tactic employed by RIG EK to evade detection, which would logically extend to the period after exploit code has been delivered and the infection process is underway.
   - **Conclusion**: Given RIG EK's known tactics and the specific context provided, it is likely that proxy servers would be used to make infections harder to detect after the exploit server returns encrypted exploit code.

Final Answer: A
