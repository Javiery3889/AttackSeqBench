To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events as described by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The StellarParticle campaign used various techniques to gain initial access, including logging into public-facing systems via SSH, using port forwarding for RDP sessions, and leveraging VPNs.
   - **Persistence:** The campaign demonstrated persistence through credential hopping, using accounts with Delegated Administrator rights, and configuring malware for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Techniques included stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA and using renamed utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** The campaign involved stealing web session cookies, using compromised service principals, and accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - **Discovery:** The threat actor used tools like AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to gather Active Directory information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after demonstrating discovery activities, the threat actor likely used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally only after accessing data from Information Repositories.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the threat actor used discovery activities (like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets) to identify Active Directory information.
   - It also mentions that the actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment as part of lateral movement.
   - However, the report does not strictly sequence these activities in a way that suggests lateral movement via RDP occurred only after accessing data from Information Repositories. Instead, it presents these as part of the broader campaign activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The threat actor's use of discovery tools suggests an effort to understand the environment, which could precede or be interspersed with lateral movement activities.
   - The report mentions accessing data from Information Repositories as part of credential access activities but does not imply this as a prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - Lateral movement via RDP is described as a tactic used throughout the environment, suggesting it could occur at various stages of the campaign, not solely after accessing specific data repositories.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided, it seems unlikely that the use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally was strictly contingent on first accessing data from Information Repositories. The campaign's tactics suggest a more fluid and concurrent approach to exploration, access, and movement within the victim's environment.

Final Answer: B
