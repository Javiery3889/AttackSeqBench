To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - The report describes a strategic web compromise (SWC) attack on the U.S. organization Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) using exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with ZxShell malware. This attack is attributed to AURORA PANDA.
   - Additionally, it mentions another adversary using the same vulnerability nearly a month before the VFW attack, targeting French aerospace and using Sakula malware.
   - The report highlights similarities between this attack and a 2012 SWC campaign against Capstone Turbine, including the use of Sakula malware and zero-day exploits.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after AURORA PANDA uses the exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware, it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that AURORA PANDA is associated with the use of ZxShell malware, not Sakula malware. Sakula malware is mentioned in the context of another adversary targeting French aerospace.
   - The question seems to conflate the two malware types and their respective uses in the attacks described. The report does not suggest that Sakula malware is used by AURORA PANDA or that it is used before leveraging the exploit code for CVE-2014-0322.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the malware associated with AURORA PANDA in the CTI report, which is ZxShell malware.
   - **Step 2:** Recognize that Sakula malware is associated with a different adversary and a different campaign targeting French aerospace.
   - **Step 3:** Understand that the question's premise about using Sakula malware before leveraging the exploit code does not align with the information provided in the CTI report regarding AURORA PANDA's tactics.
   - **Step 4:** Conclude that the scenario presented in the question does not match the attack sequence described in the CTI report for AURORA PANDA.

**Final Answer: B**
