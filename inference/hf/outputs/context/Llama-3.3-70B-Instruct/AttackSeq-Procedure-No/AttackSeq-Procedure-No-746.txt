To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack that starts with the execution of malicious macro code in a document, which drops a Crimson RAT downloader.
   - This downloader then fetches a fully functional Crimson RAT from a specified IP address (151.106.19[.]207:8246).
   - The report mentions various tactics including Persistence, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Command and Control, all related to the capabilities of the Crimson RAT.
   - The "Others" section provides context about previous attacks and suggests a connection to the APT group behind "Operation Transparent Tribe," indicating targeting of Indian officials.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after targeting Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials with a spear phishing campaign, it is likely that the attack involves using social media channels to deliver malicious files before downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.
   - The question implies a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that starts with spear phishing, potentially involves social media for delivering malicious files, and ends with the download of a Crimson RAT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of social media channels for delivering malicious files. Instead, it talks about a malicious document containing macro code that executes to drop the first payload.
   - The report does imply a phishing campaign (given the context of a malicious document being opened by the victim), but it does not specify the use of social media as a vector for delivering these documents.
   - The primary vector mentioned is a malicious document with macro code, which aligns with spear phishing tactics but does not necessarily involve social media.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial vector of the attack as described in the CTI report, which is a malicious document.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while the report implies phishing (since the document is opened by the victim), it does not explicitly mention social media as a delivery method for malicious files.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the question's scenario involving spear phishing and the potential use of social media to deliver malicious files before downloading the Crimson RAT.
   - **Step 4**: Since the CTI report does not provide direct evidence or imply the use of social media for delivering malicious files, and given that the primary described vector is a malicious document (which could be delivered via email, a more traditional phishing method), it's less likely that social media is a necessary step in this specific attack sequence as described in the report.
   
**Final Answer: B**
