To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes a cyber-espionage campaign targeting South Korean think-tanks.
   - The attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing emails deliver a Trojan dropper.
     2. **Execution**: Malware injects code into explorer.exe, decrypts and loads a spying library.
     3. **Persistence**: Malware copies itself into the System32 directory and creates a service.
     4. **Defense Evasion**: Malware disables system and AhnLab firewalls and turns off the Windows Security Center.
     5. **Discovery**: Malware gathers system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings.
     6. **Command and Control**: Malware communicates with attackers through a Bulgarian email server.
     7. **Exfiltration**: Malware exfiltrates collected data via encrypted emails.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, the malware will then gather information about the infected computer for transmission to the attackers.
   - The sequence of TTPs in question involves data collection (keystrokes, directory listings, HWP documents) followed by gathering system and user information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - According to the CTI report, the **Discovery** phase involves gathering information about the infected computer, including system and user names, keystrokes, and directory listings.
   - The question suggests a sequence where specific data (keystrokes, directory listings, HWP documents) is collected before gathering general system and user information.
   - However, the report indicates that the collection of keystrokes and directory listings is part of the broader **Discovery** phase, which also includes gathering system and user information.
   - The report does not suggest that the collection of system and user information happens after the collection of keystrokes and directory listings as a separate step in response to those actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CTI report outlines a sequence of tactics where the collection of system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings are all part of the **Discovery** phase.
   - The question implies a conditional sequence that is not directly supported by the report's description of the malware's behavior.
   - Given the information in the report, it is unlikely that the malware waits to gather system and user information only after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, as these actions are part of the same discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer, based on the provided sequence of events in the CTI report, is that the described sequence in the question does not accurately reflect the conditional dependency implied.

Final Answer: B
