To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities for initial access. An example given is the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration. It uses operational security measures to remain undetected.
   - **Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration:** These stages involve the use of customized malware for remote control, communication with C&C servers over HTTPS, and controlled exfiltration of data to avoid detection.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery, Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection (as outlined in the Vault 7 documents) before gaining initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The CTI report indicates that Longhorn's operations involve exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities for initial access and then using operational security measures to remain undetected during the discovery and subsequent stages.
   - The question seems to imply a sequence where Longhorn follows detection avoidance guidelines before initial access, which does not align with the typical sequence of events described in the CTI report. The report suggests that initial access is gained through exploits, and then measures to avoid detection are implemented post-access, during the discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration phases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the initial access method mentioned in the report, which is through zero-day vulnerabilities, including an example of a Word document exploit.
   - **Step 2:** Recognize that the detailed system fingerprinting and operational security measures to avoid detection are post-initial access activities.
   - **Step 3:** Evaluate the question's implication that detection avoidance guidelines are followed before initial access, which contradicts the sequence of events described in the CTI report.
   - **Step 4:** Conclude that the question's premise does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B**
