To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the CTI report and the question.

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report outlines APT42's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: APT42 engages in targeted spear phishing and surveillance.
     2. **Resource Development**: The group uses social engineering for credential harvesting and has developed custom backdoors.
     3. **Initial Access**: Primarily through spear phishing.
     4. **Execution**: Establishes a foothold using malware and communicates with C2 nodes.
     5. **Persistence**: Maintains presence through custom malware and scheduled tasks.
     6. **Privilege Escalation**: Uses custom malware for keystroke logging and stealing logins.
     7. **Defense Evasion**: Employs various evasion techniques.
     8. **Credential Access**: Steals credentials through dumping, interception, and keylogging.
     9. **Discovery**: Conducts internal reconnaissance by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.
     10. **Collection**: Steals credentials and documents.
     11. **Command and Control**: Uses application layer protocols for C2 communications.
     12. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data over C2 channels.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets, APT42 will conduct internal reconnaissance only after moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report indicates that APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance by browsing the compromised user's contacts and accessing the targeted organization's collaborative spaces as part of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - It also mentions that APT42 maintains access to a victim's personal or corporate email account by registering their Microsoft Authenticator application, which could be used for lateral movement.
   - The question implies a sequence where APT42 sends spear-phishing emails, potentially compromises personal email accounts, uses these to access corporate accounts (lateral movement), and then conducts internal reconnaissance.
   - The report supports the idea that APT42 uses compromised email accounts for further operations but does not strictly sequence these actions in a way that requires lateral movement before internal reconnaissance in all cases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT42's primary goal is espionage and surveillance, which involves gathering information from compromised systems and accounts.
   - The group's use of spear phishing and social engineering to compromise personal email accounts is a known tactic.
   - The ability to register their Microsoft Authenticator application for MFA bypass and maintain access to email accounts suggests they can use these accounts for further operations, including accessing corporate accounts if the victim has access to them.
   - Internal reconnaissance, as described, involves accessing contacts and collaborative spaces, which could be done after initial compromise, regardless of the specific sequence of lateral movement.
   - However, the question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence (spear-phishing, lateral movement, then internal reconnaissance), which may not capture the full flexibility of APT42's operations as described in the report.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the information in the CTI report, it seems plausible that APT42 could conduct internal reconnaissance after compromising a system or account, and this could involve accessing user contacts and system information. However, the report does not strictly imply that internal reconnaissance only occurs after lateral movement using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the provided information and the question's phrasing, would be:

**Final Answer: B**
