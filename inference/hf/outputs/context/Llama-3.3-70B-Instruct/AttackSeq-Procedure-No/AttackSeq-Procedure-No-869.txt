To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes an attack by the Sednit group, starting with an Initial Access phase via spearphishing.
   - The Execution phase involves the deployment of a downloader and a backdoor, with the backdoor's configuration stored in encrypted blobs.
   - Persistence is achieved through COM object hijacking.
   - Defense Evasion techniques include deleting files and killing processes.
   - Credential Access involves using dumpers to target browsers and email clients.
   - Discovery includes gathering system information and enumerating registry keys.
   - Collection involves scanning for specific file extensions and staging data for exfiltration.
   - Exfiltration involves sending data to a C&C server after encryption.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question focuses on the sequence of actions during the Collection and Exfiltration phases, specifically whether data is sent to the primary C&C server only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report mentions that data are sent to the C&C server after being hex-encoded and encrypted but does not explicitly discuss the use of a primary and fallback C&C server setup.
   - The question implies a specific sequence where data transmission to the primary C&C server is contingent upon the fallback C&C server becoming operational.
   - Given the report's details, the Sednit group's operations are sophisticated and involve complex command and control structures. However, the report does not provide explicit information about the conditional use of a fallback C&C server for initiating communications with the primary C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the attack sequence and techniques used by the Sednit group.
   - **Step 2**: Identify the specific phase (Collection and Exfiltration) in question.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the report does not explicitly mention the use of a fallback C&C server as a prerequisite for communicating with the primary C&C server.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the sophistication of the Sednit group's operations and the possibility of complex C&C structures.
   - **Step 5**: Since the report does not provide explicit details supporting the conditional use of a fallback C&C server for initiating data transmission to the primary C&C server, and given the nature of the question, the most plausible answer based on the information provided and typical C&C server operations would be that the data transmission is not necessarily contingent on a fallback server becoming operational.

**Final Answer: B**
