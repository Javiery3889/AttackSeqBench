To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers.

1. **Analysis of the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers compromised a website and used a watering hole attack to infect visitors by exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
   - **Execution:** The malware exploits the VBScript engine vulnerability, downloads a DLL, and executes it in PowerShell. It checks for antivirus software and exits if found. It also exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - **Persistence:** The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself and creating a Run registry key.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Achieved through exploiting CVE-2015-1701.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware exits if it detects antivirus software.
   - **Discovery:** The SLUB backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub, parses it for commands, and retrieves system information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor collects various data, including screenshots, files, and information from registry keys. It also creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication is via Slack, using hardcoded authentication tokens.

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after performing discovery, the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders only, then post download links to the Slack channel, and finally build CAB files.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including creating archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration. However, it does not specify that this is the only method of exfiltration or that it is followed by posting download links to the Slack channel and then building CAB files.
   - The report does mention that the backdoor collects information and can upload files to the file.io website, which implies exfiltration capabilities beyond just archiving Desktop folders.
   - The use of Slack for command and control, including posting messages and command results, is mentioned, but there's no specific detail on posting download links as part of the exfiltration process.
   - Building CAB files is not mentioned in the report as part of the attackers' TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' methods for data collection and exfiltration are varied, including archiving Desktop folders.
   - The primary method of communication and potential data exfiltration mentioned involves Slack and uploading files to file.io, not specifically building CAB files or the exact sequence described in the question.
   - Given the information in the CTI report, the sequence described in the question (exfiltrating data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders only, then posting download links to the Slack channel, and then building CAB files) does not align perfectly with the described TTPs.

**Final Answer: B**
