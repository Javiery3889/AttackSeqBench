To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the CTI report and analyze the sequence of events described.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This document contains encrypted script data and an external template that, when downloaded, contains malicious VBA macros. The external template is fetched via URL shortening services, redirecting to a domain controlled by the attacker.

2. **Defense Evasion and Payload Deployment**: The VBA code in the external template decrypts embedded data, dropping two files: 'fmx.ps1' (a PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code). The report mentions that the malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components, but it does not explicitly state that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.

3. **Command and Control**: After the payload is deployed, the Bandook loader injects a malicious payload into an Internet Explorer process using Process Hollowing, contacts the C&C server, and awaits further commands.

Given this sequence, the question asks whether it is likely that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'. The report does not directly support this specific sequence of actions for 'fmx.ps1'. It mentions the generation of the payload using image files and the dropping of 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg', but it does not detail 'fmx.ps1' downloading a zip file as part of its actions.

However, considering the tactics and techniques used by the Bandook campaign, including the use of encrypted data, external templates, and the generation of the malware payload from seemingly innocuous files (like images), it's plausible that the campaign could involve downloading additional components in a stealthy manner. Yet, the specific action of 'fmx.ps1' downloading a zip file before decoding and executing 'sdmc.jpg' is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

Given the information provided and focusing strictly on the described sequence of events, the most accurate answer based on the report's details would be:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The report details the initial access method and the deployment of 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.
- It discusses the evasion techniques and the final payload's communication with the C&C server.
- The specific action of 'fmx.ps1' downloading a zip file for the malware payload before executing 'sdmc.jpg' is not explicitly stated.

**Final Answer: B**
