To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**: The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca, a threat actor. The tactics are aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and include Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. Specifically, during the Discovery phase, Earth Lusca used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner to discover machines in the compromised network environment.

2. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if, after employing scanning tools during the discovery phase, it is likely that Earth Lusca will use "pass the ticket" methods to engage in lateral movement. "Pass the ticket" is a technique where an attacker uses a stolen ticket (like a Kerberos ticket) to access resources without needing the password, which is a method of lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The CTI report mentions the use of scanning tools during the Discovery phase, which aligns with the premise of the question.
   - It also mentions the use of tools like Mimikatz to retrieve credentials and the exploitation of the domain controller using the ZeroLogon exploit, indicating an interest in credential access that could facilitate lateral movement.
   - The report does not explicitly mention "pass the ticket" as a technique used by Earth Lusca, but it does discuss credential access and the use of tools that could potentially be used for such purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the relevance of scanning tools in the discovery phase as mentioned in the report and the question. This indicates Earth Lusca's interest in network discovery, which often precedes lateral movement.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the threat actor's focus on credential access, which is crucial for lateral movement. Techniques like using Mimikatz and exploiting the domain controller suggest an ability and willingness to obtain and use credentials for movement within the network.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of using "pass the ticket" as a method for lateral movement given the context. While the report does not explicitly mention this technique, the emphasis on credential access and the use of sophisticated tools for network discovery and exploitation suggest that Earth Lusca might employ advanced credential-based movement techniques.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Earth Lusca's demonstrated capabilities in credential access and network discovery, and considering the typical progression of tactics after such activities, it is plausible that they would use methods like "pass the ticket" for lateral movement, especially since they have shown an interest in exploiting domain controllers and using tools that can facilitate such actions.

Final Answer: A
