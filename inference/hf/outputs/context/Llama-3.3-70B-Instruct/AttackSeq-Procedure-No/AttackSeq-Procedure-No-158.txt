To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the CTI Report**:
   - The report describes APT10's tactics starting with **Initial Access** via spear phishing emails.
   - After gaining access, APT10 deploys malware for **Execution**, performs **Internal Reconnaissance**, and ensures access to legitimate credentials.
   - The report then details **Persistence**, **Privilege Escalation**, **Defense Evasion**, **Credential Access**, **Lateral Movement**, **Collection**, **Command and Control**, and **Exfiltration** tactics.
   - Key points for our analysis include the use of spear phishing for initial access, the deployment of malware for remote access, and the leveraging of shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question asks if, after gaining initial access via spear phishing, APT10 is likely to extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and then perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.
   - The question focuses on the actions taken post-initial access and pre-lateral movement, specifically regarding network exploration and expansion tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention extracting names of locally reachable Wi-Fi networks or performing brute-force attacks as part of APT10's tactics post-initial access.
   - APT10's methods post-initial access, as described, involve deploying malware, performing internal reconnaissance, and leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement, but do not include the specific actions mentioned in the question.
   - The report emphasizes the use of malware, credential theft, and exploitation of MSP infrastructure for movement and data exfiltration, rather than brute-force attacks on Wi-Fi networks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method used by APT10, which is spear phishing.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the post-access tactics described in the report, which include malware deployment, internal reconnaissance, and credential theft.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate if extracting Wi-Fi network names and performing brute-force attacks are mentioned as tactics used by APT10, which they are not.
   - **Step 4**: Consider APT10's primary methods for lateral movement, which involve leveraging shared MSP infrastructure, not brute-force attacks on Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information in the CTI report, APT10's tactics post-initial access do not include extracting names of locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and performing brute-force attacks to spread to new networks before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
