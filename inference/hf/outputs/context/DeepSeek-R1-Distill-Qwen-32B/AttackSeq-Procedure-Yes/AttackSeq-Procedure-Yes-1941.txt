Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a HTTP GET request after establishing communication with its C2 servers. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to understand the attack sequence and see how it relates to the question.

First, the report mentions that Smooth Operator is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software. The malware is in a dylib, which then downloads and executes a second-stage payload called UpdateAgent. So, the initial access is through the infected software, and the execution happens as part of the 3CX software.

Next, the persistence mechanism is using a legitimate component of 3CX, so it runs every time libffmpeg.dylib is loaded. That's interesting because it means the malware can maintain persistence without being easily detected.

For defense evasion, the second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process. It also deletes itself from the disk after execution, which is a common tactic to avoid detection. Additionally, it writes configuration files and executables to the legitimate 3CX directory, making it look more legitimate. The C2 traffic is obfuscated with a custom encoding algorithm, which suggests they're trying to hide their communications.

In the discovery phase, Smooth Operator collects information like OS version, domain, and account names from specific files. This data is included in beacons or exfiltration. The collection phase involves extracting OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index, which are part of every beacon. The UpdateAgent also parses config.json for domain and account info.

Command and Control (C2) communication is over HTTPS with custom encoding. It uses multiple C2 servers, randomly choosing each time, and if one fails, it tries another. This redundancy is a good way to ensure communication isn't easily disrupted.

Looking at the "Others" section, it mentions that the malware sleeps for 7 to 20 days before beaconing, uses a time-seeded random algorithm for beacon intervals, and has an embedded list of 15 C2s. It also has taskable functionality, meaning it can receive commands from the C2. The second-stage payload is lightweight, suggesting it's for initial data collection and possibly to determine further actions.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after establishing C2 communication. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, the C2 communication uses HTTPS, not HTTP. The data is obfuscated with a custom encoding algorithm. The report doesn't mention HTTP GET requests specifically. Instead, it talks about beacons and exfiltration, but the method isn't detailed beyond HTTPS and custom encoding.

Moreover, the second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, is described as lightweight and likely used to determine which victims to target further. It parses data from config.json and includes it in beacons. However, the report doesn't specify that this data is sent via HTTP GET. Since the C2 communication is over HTTPS, it's more likely that the exfiltration uses HTTPS as well, not HTTP.

Additionally, using HTTP GET for exfiltration might be less stealthy compared to HTTPS, especially since the malware employs several evasion techniques. The report emphasizes obfuscation and stealth, so using HTTP GET might not align with that strategy.

Therefore, considering the information, it's unlikely that the malware uses HTTP GET for exfiltration. It's more probable that it uses HTTPS with custom encoding as described.
</think>

The Smooth Operator malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS using a custom data encoding algorithm. The report does not mention the use of HTTP GET requests for exfiltration. Instead, it emphasizes the use of HTTPS and obfuscation techniques. Given the malware's focus on stealth and the use of HTTPS for C2 communication, it is unlikely to use HTTP GET for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
