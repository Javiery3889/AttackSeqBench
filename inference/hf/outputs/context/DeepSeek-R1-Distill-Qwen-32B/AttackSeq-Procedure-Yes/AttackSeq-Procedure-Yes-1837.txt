Okay, so I need to figure out whether the callCam app encrypts the collected data using RSA and AES during the Collection phase before exfiltration. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Discovery phase, callCam collects a lot of information. Then, in the Exfiltration phase, it says that the app encrypts the data using RSA and AES, verifies integrity with SHA256, and uses a customized encoding routine before sending it to the C&C server.

Wait, the question is about whether this encryption happens during the Collection phase. But according to the report, the encryption is part of the Exfiltration phase, not the Collection phase. So the Collection phase is when the data is gathered, and then during Exfiltration, it's encrypted and sent out.

So the answer would be No because the encryption isn't done during Collection but during Exfiltration. Therefore, the correct answer is B: No.

The CTI report indicates that encryption occurs during the Exfiltration phase, not the Collection phase. Therefore, the callCam app does not encrypt data during the Collection phase.

Final Answer: B: No
