Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app collects geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending it via HTTP to the C&C server. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the XAgent app is fully functional malware. On iOS 7, it hides its icon and runs in the background. When terminated, it restarts almost immediately. On iOS 8, it doesn't hide the icon and can't restart automatically, suggesting it was designed before iOS 8.

Looking at the Command and Control section, the app sends information via HTTP using POST and GET requests. The logs are in HTML with color coding, which helps human operators. The URIs are randomly generated from a template, and there's a token for module identification, which is Base64 encoded with a random prefix. Additionally, the app can upload files via FTP.

The question is about whether the app collects geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending it via HTTP. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, I don't see any explicit mention of the app collecting geo-location data. The report talks about information collection from the iOS device, but it doesn't specify what kind of information. It does mention that the app sends information via HTTP, but without details on the type of data collected.

However, considering that the app is malware, it's common for such malware to collect various types of data, including location, to aid in espionage or other malicious activities. But since the report doesn't explicitly state that it collects geo-location data, I can't assume it does. The report focuses on the method of communication and the app's behavior regarding execution and persistence.

Therefore, without explicit evidence from the report, it's not certain that the app collects geo-location data. So, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details the XAgent app's behavior on iOS 7, including its ability to hide its icon, restart upon termination, and communicate via HTTP. However, it does not explicitly mention the collection of geo-location data. While malware often gathers such information, the absence of specific details in the report means we cannot confirm this activity. 

Final Answer: B: No
