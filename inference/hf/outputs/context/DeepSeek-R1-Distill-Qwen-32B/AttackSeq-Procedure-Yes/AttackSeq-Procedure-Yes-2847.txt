Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Asruex malware detects anti-virus software before retrieving an image file from the C&C server. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the attack starts with a malicious shortcut file sent via email. When opened, it infects the host with Asruex malware. The initial execution involves a PowerShell command that downloads a batch file, which then executes more PowerShell scripts to get a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.

Next, the Execution phase says that the downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex. This image is then decoded and executed. The Command and Control section notes that Asruex communicates with a C&C server over HTTP, executing commands received. It uses configuration info stored within, like C&C servers, dummy hosts, version info, and a key for decoding data.

The "Others" section adds that Asruex is new, likely used in targeted attacks, and it downloads AdvProv.dll, which adds functionality like file manipulation and registry operations. There's also mention of hash values and URLs for security measures.

Now, the question is whether Asruex detects anti-virus software before retrieving the image file. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any explicit mention of anti-virus detection mechanisms. The report details the steps of the attack: opening the shortcut, executing PowerShell, downloading the batch file, executing scripts, downloading the image, decoding, and execution. It also mentions that Asruex communicates with the C&C server and uses configuration info, but nothing about checking for anti-virus software.

Since the report doesn't mention any anti-virus evasion techniques, I can't assume that Asruex includes such steps. The sequence of events doesn't include a step where it checks for anti-virus before retrieving the image. Therefore, it's unlikely that Asruex detects anti-virus software before that step.

So, the answer should be No.
</think>

The CTI report outlines the attack sequence starting with a malicious shortcut file leading to the execution of Asruex malware. The report details the steps of the attack, including the use of PowerShell, downloading a batch file, executing scripts, and retrieving an encoded image from the C&C server. However, there is no mention of Asruex detecting anti-virus software before retrieving the image. Therefore, based on the information provided, Asruex is not likely to perform such detection.

Final Answer: B: No
