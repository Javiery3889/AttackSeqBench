Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware after establishing command and control communication. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with C&C servers. They used these backdoors to poll for tasks and execute commands. So, the command and control part is clear.

Now, the question is about whether they then deployed Hermes ransomware. The report details several steps: execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. It talks about using a loader/spreader, establishing persistence via registry keys, using Polyglot files, and moving laterally using hardcoded credentials.

But I don't see any mention of ransomware in the report. The main goal here seems to be the FEIB heist, which involved unauthorized SWIFT transfers, not ransomware deployment. The report also mentions the use of backdoors for control, but no indication of encryption or ransom notes.

Hermes ransomware specifically uses a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leaves ransom notes. Since the report doesn't mention any encryption activities or ransom demands, it's unlikely they used Hermes. Their objective was financial theft, not ransom.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be no, they didn't deploy Hermes ransomware.

The CTI report details the Lazarus group's activities during the FEIB heist, focusing on their use of malware for command and control, but does not mention any ransomware deployment. Their objective was financial theft, not encryption or ransom demands. Therefore, it's unlikely they used Hermes ransomware.

Final Answer: B: No
