Okay, so I need to figure out whether the SLUB backdoor retrieves the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before exfiltrating data. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the SLUB backdoor is involved in several MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) after persistence is achieved. Specifically, it's asking if the backdoor retrieves username and computer name before exfiltration.

Looking at the report, under the "Collection" section, it says the backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading to file.io. It also collects information from registry keys and creates archives of the user's Desktop folders. 

Now, the question is about whether it retrieves the username and computer name. The report doesn't explicitly mention that, but it does say that the backdoor collects information from registry keys. Registry keys often contain system information, including the username and computer name. For example, the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion contains the ComputerName value, and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders can have the username in the path.

Additionally, the backdoor's ability to list files and take screenshots suggests it's gathering information about the environment, which would include identifying the user and the machine. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in MITRE ATT&CK, where adversaries gather system information to understand the environment better.

Furthermore, the backdoor uses Slack for C2, which implies it needs some form of identification to communicate effectively. Knowing the username and computer name could help in organizing the exfiltrated data or in internal tracking by the attackers.

So, even though the report doesn't directly state that the backdoor retrieves username and computer name, the collection of registry information and the nature of the backdoor's activities strongly suggest that it does. Therefore, the answer is likely yes.

The SLUB backdoor collects information from registry keys, which often include the username and computer name. This aligns with the Discovery tactic, indicating it gathers system information before exfiltration.
