Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Lazarus group likely deployed Hermes ransomware after using their backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands. The question is asking if this sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) is plausible based on the CTI report provided.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step to understand the attack sequence. The report is structured under different MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, Command and Control, and Others.

Starting with Execution: The report mentions that the Lazarus group used a loader/spreader malware called Sample #2. This malware established persistence via a registry key and tried to disable antivirus processes. They also used a 'Polyglot' file, which was a ZIP file hidden in a bitmap image. This file was decrypted and executed as a TMP file. Additionally, they used backdoor malware, Samples #4 and #6, which were packed with Themida and communicated with C&C servers to execute remote commands.

Next, Persistence: The malware was placed in the C:\Windows\Temp directory and a registry key was set for automatic execution. It also spread using hardcoded FEIB user accounts and passwords.

Defense Evasion: They killed antivirus processes using taskkill, used the Polyglot file to hide the ZIP, and packed the backdoors with Themida to evade detection.

Lateral Movement: The malware copied itself to other devices using hardcoded IPs and credentials, targeting SMB shares.

Command and Control: The backdoors communicated with C&C servers, expecting parameters for address and port, and executed commands as directed.

Now, the question is about whether after using the backdoor for C&C, they deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backups. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of ransomware, specifically Hermes. The report details the use of loader/spreader, backdoors, and their activities like persistence, lateral movement, and C&C communication. There's no indication that they encrypted files, demanded ransom, or targeted backups or Volume Shadow Copies. The main goal here seems to be the heist, which involved unauthorized SWIFT transfers, not disrupting operations through ransomware.

Hermes ransomware is known for targeting financial institutions, but the report doesn't mention any ransomware deployment. The Lazarus group's activities here were more about gaining access, moving laterally, and communicating with C&C to execute commands, likely to facilitate the heist rather than disrupt through ransomware.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not likely that they deployed Hermes ransomware in this attack sequence.
</think>

The CTI report details the Lazarus group's attack on FEIB, focusing on their use of malware for execution, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. There is no mention of ransomware deployment, specifically Hermes, which is typically used to encrypt files and demand ransom. The attack's primary objective was a financial heist, not disrupting operations through ransomware. Thus, it's unlikely they used Hermes.

Final Answer: B: No
