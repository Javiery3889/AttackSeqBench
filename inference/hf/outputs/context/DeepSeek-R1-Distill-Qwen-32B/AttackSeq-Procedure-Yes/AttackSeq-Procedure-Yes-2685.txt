Okay, so I need to figure out whether Elfin would exploit CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails before deploying their malware tools. Let me start by understanding the CTI report and the question.

From the report, Elfin's attack sequence starts with Reconnaissance, where they scan for vulnerable websites. Then, in Execution, they deploy various tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill. The question is asking if, after the reconnaissance phase, they would exploit a specific CVE through spear-phishing before using those tools.

I know that CVE-2018-20250 is related to a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework, which was used in attacks like the ones by the group behind the 2017 Equifax breach. Exploiting such a vulnerability typically involves delivering an exploit via a web request, often through a malicious link or a spear-phishing email that tricks the user into visiting a compromised website.

Looking at the report, Elfin uses spear-phishing as part of their Execution phase. They send emails with malicious attachments or links, which then execute their malware. So, after identifying targets during Reconnaissance, it makes sense that they would use spear-phishing to deliver the exploit, which would then allow them to execute their tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill.

The report mentions that they deploy a wide range of tools, including custom and commodity malware, which suggests that they have multiple methods of execution. Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector, so it aligns with their tactics.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, they would likely use spear-phishing to exploit the CVE before deploying their malware.

The Elfin group's attack sequence begins with reconnaissance, followed by using spear-phishing emails to deliver exploits, which then leads to the deployment of their malware tools. Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing fits this pattern as a method to gain initial access before executing their tools.

Final Answer: A: Yes
