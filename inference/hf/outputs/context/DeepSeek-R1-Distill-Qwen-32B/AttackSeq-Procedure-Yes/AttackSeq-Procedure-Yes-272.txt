Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the DnE1.Ps1 file will use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution after the Helminth Trojan uses a customized Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The attack starts with Initial Access through a Word document exploiting a vulnerability to install the Helminth Trojan. Then, Execution happens via mshta.exe, which usually shows a warning but the attack disables it. Persistence is achieved with a scheduled task and VBS file. Defense Evasion includes signature regeneration and Mimikatz for credential access. The Mimikatz script is customized to handle non-ASCII and validate the scheduled task.

The question is about whether DnE1.Ps1 uses DNS queries to get a bat script. I need to see if the report mentions anything about DNS or how the C&C communication works.

Looking through the report, I don't see any mention of DNS exchange queries or how the C&C communication is handled. The report talks about the C&C servers being active but doesn't specify the method of communication. It does mention that the attack uses a fileless variant and a VBS file for persistence, but nothing about DNS.

So, the question is whether DnE1.Ps1 would use DNS to download a bat script. Since the report doesn't provide details on the communication method, I can't confirm it. However, the Mimikatz part is about credential gathering, not necessarily about how the C&C is communicated with.

Therefore, without evidence in the report, it's not likely that DnE1.Ps1 uses DNS for this purpose. The answer would be No.

The CTI report does not provide specific details about the use of DNS exchange queries by the DnE1.Ps1 file. It focuses on the initial access, execution, persistence, and evasion tactics, including the use of Mimikatz for credential access. Since there's no mention of DNS-based communication, it's unlikely that DnE1.Ps1 uses DNS to download a bat script.

Final Answer: B: No
