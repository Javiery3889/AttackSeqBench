Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app is likely to exfiltrate data via HTTP requests using a Base64 encoded token. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the XAgent app is part of Operation Pawn Storm and is an iOS malware. It's noted that the malware is installed on already compromised systems and is similar to SEDNIT malware used on Windows. That gives me some context about its sophistication.

Looking at the Execution section, the app's icon is hidden on iOS 7, and it runs in the background. If you try to terminate it, it restarts immediately. On iOS 8, the icon isn't hidden, and it doesn't restart automatically. This suggests the malware was designed before iOS 8, which was released in September 2014. So, the malware is a bit older, but still functional.

In the Discovery section, the app collects a lot of data: text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status. The question is about whether it exfiltrates this data via HTTP with a Base64 token.

Now, the question is asking if it's likely that the app uses HTTP requests and a Base64 token for C&C communication. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to think about how malware typically exfiltrates data. HTTP is a common method because it's easy to use and blends in with normal traffic. Base64 encoding is often used to encode data for transmission, especially in web communications, as it's a standard method to represent binary data in an ASCII string format.

The report doesn't explicitly mention how the data is exfiltrated, but it does say the app collects various data. Since the app is designed to collect information, it's logical that it would need a way to send that data back to the attackers. Using HTTP with Base64 encoding is a plausible method because it's both effective and not too conspicuous.

Additionally, the fact that the malware is similar to SEDNIT, which is known for its sophisticated techniques, supports the idea that it would use such methods. SEDNIT malware often uses encryption and encoding to communicate with C&C servers, so it's reasonable to assume XAgent does the same.

I don't see any information in the report that contradicts this. The report doesn't mention other exfiltration methods, but it's also possible that the report doesn't cover all aspects of the malware's functionality. However, given the information provided, the most logical conclusion is that the app would use HTTP with Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Yes.
</think>

The XAgent app, as described, collects various data from iOS devices and is likely to exfiltrate this information. Given that HTTP is a common method for data transmission and Base64 encoding is frequently used for encoding data in web communications, it is plausible that the app uses these methods. Additionally, the malware's similarity to the sophisticated SEDNIT malware supports the use of such techniques. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
