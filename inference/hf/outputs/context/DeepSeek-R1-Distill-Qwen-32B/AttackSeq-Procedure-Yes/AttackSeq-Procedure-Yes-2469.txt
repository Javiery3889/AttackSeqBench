Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading them to an FTP server. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what happened.

First, the attack started with an email to Susan, a secretary. The email had a PDF attachment that was actually an executable. When she opened it, the attack began. The executable created a folder and extracted six files. It ran 'stat.vbs', which then executed 'deca.bat'. This batch file opened a blank PDF and ran 'dcp.exe', a file encryption tool. It decrypted two files and extracted 'bare.zip' into another folder. Then 'sai.vbs' was executed.

Next, for persistence, the attack modified the Windows registry to run 'aagi.bat' at system start. It also used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection. Additionally, an application was configured to run another batch file every hour to maintain operations.

In terms of defense evasion, the attackers used legitimate tools and scripts without malicious activity, avoiding detection for almost six months. They collected credentials every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files from various firms in the oil and gas sector. The command and control involved using FTP to upload stolen credentials to an external server, with 'iei.bat' running every hour to manage data collection and transmission. Exfiltration was done via FTP, with the oldest files from August 2013.

The 'Others' section mentions that the attack targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime sector, linked to fake oil deals. The attackers were based in Nigeria, specifically Ikeja, known as the 'Computer Village'. Victims didn't report the crime, and the case emphasizes the need for regular audits and better network security.

Now, the question is whether after setting up persistence by running batch files every hour, the attackers would use legitimate apps to collect credentials from password stores before uploading via FTP.

Looking at the report, under Persistence, it says they used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them with timestamps. So they were indeed using legitimate tools for credential collection. Also, under Command and Control, they used FTP to upload the stolen data. So the sequence is: persistence via batch files, collection using legitimate apps, then exfiltration via FTP.

The question is asking if this sequence is likely. The answer choices are Yes or No. Since the report explicitly mentions using legitimate apps for credential collection and FTP for exfiltration, the answer should be Yes.

The CTI report details that the Phantom Menace attackers used legitimate applications to collect credentials and then uploaded them via FTP. This aligns with the question's scenario, confirming the sequence.

Final Answer: A
