Okay, so I need to figure out whether the T9000 malware compresses and encrypts the stolen data before sending it over the C2 channel. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the collection phase, T9000 captures data about the infected system and steals files from removable media. It also specifically targets Skype users, capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and communications like video calls, audio calls, and chat messages.

Looking at the Command and Control section, it says that the malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port. The traffic is encrypted and includes a beacon and collected information. The C2 server's details are extracted from the configuration file, and it supports proxy usage for victims behind web proxies.

So, the key points here are that the data is sent over an encrypted channel using a binary protocol. The report doesn't explicitly state whether the data is compressed, but it does mention encryption. However, in many malware cases, especially those that are sophisticated, they often compress data to reduce the size of the payload being sent, which helps avoid detection and speeds up transmission. Encryption is also common to prevent the data from being intercepted and read by third parties.

Given that the malware uses encrypted traffic, it's plausible that they would also compress the data to make it more efficient. The report doesn't explicitly say, but the combination of encryption and the nature of the data (which could be large, like screenshots or video calls) suggests that compression is likely.

So, putting it together, the answer is probably yes, the malware compresses and encrypts the data before exfiltration.

The T9000 malware, as described in the CTI report, steals sensitive data during the collection phase, including Skype communications and files from removable drives. It communicates with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol. While the report doesn't explicitly mention compression, the use of encryption and the potential size of the data (e.g., screenshots, videos) suggests that compression is likely used to optimize transmission. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware compresses and encrypts the data before exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
