Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in the RevengeHotels campaign collect credit card information from OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites after using spear-phishing emails to execute RAT malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI report, the initial access is through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. These attachments use template injection to execute macros, which then download RATs like RevengeRAT, NjRAT, etc. So the first step is initial access via phishing, leading to execution of malware.

Next, the Execution section mentions that the malware includes modules like ScreenBooking, which captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically booking.com. Also, in ProCC campaigns, the malware captures data from the clipboard and printer spooler, as well as screenshots. So the malware is designed to collect data from web pages, including those of OTAs.

The Credential Access section states that attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and OTAs. They also sell credentials, allowing others to steal credit card details from hotel software. This directly indicates that credit card info from OTAs is a target.

Putting it all together, the attack sequence is: Initial Access (spear-phishing) → Execution (malware execution) → Credential Access (targeting credit card data from OTAs). The question asks if, after initial access and execution, they collect credit card info from OTAs. The report clearly states they do, so the answer should be yes.

The RevengeHotels campaign uses spear-phishing to execute RAT malware, which includes modules designed to capture credit card data from OTAs. The report explicitly mentions targeting booking.com and collecting such information.
