Okay, so I need to figure out whether the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols after being used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details a cyber attack involving the RMS tool. The attack started with a spear-phishing campaign targeting US-based retailers. The phishing emails had malicious MS Office documents that tricked users into enabling macros, which then downloaded the RMS tool and other components.

The report mentions that the initial access was through spear-phishing, and execution involved macros downloading the payload. Persistence was achieved by adding a registry entry to run RMS on user login. For defense evasion, the threat actors used RMS for reconnaissance and lateral movement, leveraging its legitimate appearance to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about whether the RMS executable communicated with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, it says that the initial payload was a malware downloader that gathered further components, including RMS. The malicious payloads were downloaded from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure, which often used legitimate-looking domains. However, the report doesn't specify the location of these C2 servers. It does mention that the campaign was active in December 2018 and that the indicators of compromise were consistent with an attack against the Notary Chamber of Ukraine around the same time. It also notes that RMS was used in attacks against US-based retailers and the financial industry.

The question is about whether the C2 server was in Germany. The report doesn't provide any information about the geographical location of the C2 servers. It only mentions that the domains looked legitimate. Since there's no specific mention of Germany, I can't assume that the C2 was there. The fact that the attack targeted US-based retailers and had connections to Ukraine doesn't necessarily mean the C2 was in Germany.

Additionally, the report doesn't discuss the use of application layer protocols in communication. It talks about the use of legitimate tools and domains but doesn't specify the protocols used for C2 communication.

Therefore, without explicit information about the C2 server's location or the protocols used, it's not possible to confirm that the RMS executable communicated with a C2 in Germany using application layer protocols. The answer should be No because there's no evidence supporting that specific claim.
</think>

The CTI report does not provide information about the C2 server's location or the use of application layer protocols. It only mentions that the C2 infrastructure used legitimate-looking domains. Since there's no evidence pointing to a server in Germany or specific protocols, the answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
