Okay, so I need to figure out whether, after the reconnaissance activities described in the CTI report, it's likely that BlackEnergy 3 would establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers once installed via employee macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI report, the attack sequence starts with Reconnaissance. The adversaries gather open-source intelligence and conduct active discovery methods like scanning and social media analysis. Then, they move to Initial Access by sending phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments. When employees enable macros, the RAT (BlackEnergy 3) is installed.

Next, the report mentions that after installation, the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server. Specifically, in the Command and Control section (Step 5), it says that once the macros are enabled, the VBA script installs the malware, which then attempts to communicate via HTTP requests. So, the installation of the RAT leads directly to establishing a C2 connection.

The question is asking if, after the reconnaissance, the implants will establish C2 communication once installed. From the report, it's clear that the installation process includes establishing this connection. So, the answer should be yes.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the report, the answer is A.

The CTI report details that after the reconnaissance phase, the adversaries use phishing emails to install BlackEnergy 3 via macros. Once installed, the malware establishes a C2 connection. Therefore, it is likely that the implants will communicate with the C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
