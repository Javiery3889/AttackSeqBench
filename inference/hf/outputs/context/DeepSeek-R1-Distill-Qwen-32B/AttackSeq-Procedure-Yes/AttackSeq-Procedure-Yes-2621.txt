Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Machete uses standard FTP and HTTP ports before falling back to other channels. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Machete is a malware used in the Machete campaign. The initial access is through spearphishing emails with malicious files. Then, execution involves a downloader that installs a backdoor. Persistence is maintained using Task Scheduler and hidden files. Defense evasion includes obfuscation and masquerading as legitimate apps.

Looking at the collection phase, Machete steals clipboard contents, copies files, logs keystrokes, takes screenshots, and stages data in a temp folder. Then, during exfiltration, it encrypts data with AES, sometimes base64 encodes it, and sends it over the same channel used for C&C. It also schedules data transfers every 10 minutes and can copy data to removable drives if a special file is present.

The question is about whether Machete uses standard FTP and HTTP ports before fallback channels. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, it says that data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C. It doesn't explicitly mention using standard ports like 80 (HTTP) or 21 (FTP). Instead, it focuses on encryption and scheduled transfers. The report doesn't specify the ports used, but it does mention that data is encrypted and sent over the C&C channel. 

I don't see any indication that Machete uses standard ports first and then falls back. It might use encrypted channels or other methods to avoid detection, which is common in malware to evade firewalls that monitor standard ports. So, it's more likely that Machete doesn't rely on standard ports but uses other methods for communication.

Therefore, the answer is probably No.

The CTI report indicates that Machete exfiltrates data over the same channel used for command and control (C&C), with encrypted data transmission. There is no mention of using standard FTP or HTTP ports; instead, it employs encryption and scheduled transfers. This suggests that Machete likely avoids standard ports to evade detection, using alternative methods for communication.

Final Answer: B: No
