Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to the question is A: Yes or B: No. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Execution phase, when the malicious shortcut is opened, a PowerShell command is executed. This PowerShell script downloads a batch file from a URL, which then runs more PowerShell scripts. These scripts download two things: a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document. The decoy documents are in Japanese and Chinese, suggesting they're targeting a broader range of organizations.

Now, the question is asking if, after downloading the Windows executable and decoy document, the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. So, I need to see if the report indicates that the downloader does this.

Looking at the report, it says that the Asruex malware has certain features like anti-analysis and can download AdvProv.dll, which adds more functionality. But I don't see any mention of the downloader retrieving an image file with encoded Asruex. The report talks about the initial infection via the shortcut, the execution phase where the downloader and decoy are fetched, and then the malware's behavior, but not about an image file being used as a delivery method for the malware itself.

So, the sequence is: shortcut -> PowerShell -> batch file -> PowerShell scripts -> download executable (downloader) and decoy. The downloader then probably communicates with the C2 server, but the report doesn't specify that it retrieves an image file with encoded malware. Instead, it seems the Asruex is already part of the initial infection process, not something that's downloaded later as an image.

Therefore, it's unlikely that the downloader retrieves an image file with encoded Asruex during the command and control phase. The answer should be B: No.
</think>

The CTI report details the attack sequence where a malicious shortcut leads to the execution of PowerShell scripts, which download a downloader executable and a decoy document. The report mentions the Asruex malware's features but does not indicate that the downloader retrieves an image file with encoded malware. Instead, Asruex is part of the initial infection, not a subsequent download. 

Final Answer: B
