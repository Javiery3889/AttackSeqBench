Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware communicates with the C&C servers using application layer protocols after gathering system information. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes an attack where the initial access was through a watering-hole attack on the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website. The site was compromised to download malicious JavaScript files, which then led to malware downloads. The malware in question is gpsvc.exe, which is packed with Enigma Protector. It's known to be associated with the Lazarus group.

The report mentions that the malware executes system information gathering commands, including hostname, user details, system version, network configuration, and active TCP connections. These results are sent back to the C&C server at eye-watch.in. Additionally, the report notes that the eye-watch.in domain has been used in other attacks and is associated with delivering malware and exploits, including a Silverlight exploit based on CVE-2016-0034.

Now, the question is asking if, after discovering this system information, the malware is likely to communicate with the identified C&C servers at specific IP addresses using application layer protocols. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to consider what application layer protocols are. These include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc., which are used for data transfer over the network. The report doesn't explicitly state the protocols used, but it does mention that the C&C server is at eye-watch.in. Since eye-watch.in is a domain, it's likely that the communication is over HTTP or HTTPS, which are application layer protocols.

Moreover, the malware sends system information back to the C&C, which implies some form of network communication. Given that the C&C is a domain, it's standard for such communications to use application layer protocols. The report also mentions that the domain has been used for other malicious activities, including delivering malware, which typically uses HTTP/HTTPS.

Additionally, the report doesn't mention any low-level protocols like TCP or UDP being used specifically, which are transport layer. The focus is on the domain and the information sent, which aligns with application layer communication.

So, putting it all together, it's reasonable to conclude that the malware communicates with the C&C using application layer protocols.
</think>

The malware gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server at eye-watch.in, which is a domain typically accessed via application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. The report doesn't specify low-level protocols, further supporting the use of application layer communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
