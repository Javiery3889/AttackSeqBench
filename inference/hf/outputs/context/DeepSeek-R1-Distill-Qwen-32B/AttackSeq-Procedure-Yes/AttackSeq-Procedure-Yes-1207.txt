Okay, so I need to figure out whether PyFlash communicates with its C&C server using AES-128 in CBC mode on ports like 8000 after gathering system info. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the discovery phase, PyFlash executes commands like systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, getmac, and arp. It then sends this information to the C&C server. The exfiltration section says that the output is exfiltrated using the C&C protocol. 

Now, the question is about whether PyFlash uses AES-128 in CBC mode on ports like 8000. The report doesn't explicitly mention the encryption method or the ports used. It only states that the exfiltration uses the C&C protocol. 

I know that in many cases, malware uses encryption to hide their communications. AES-128 in CBC mode is a common method, but without specific info, I can't confirm it. Also, ports like 8000 are non-standard, but again, the report doesn't specify. 

Since the report doesn't provide details on encryption or ports, I can't assume they use AES-128 on port 8000. So, the answer is likely no because there's no evidence supporting that specific method and port.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that PyFlash exfiltrates data using a C&C protocol but does not specify encryption methods or ports. Without explicit details, we cannot confirm the use of AES-128 in CBC mode on port 8000. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
