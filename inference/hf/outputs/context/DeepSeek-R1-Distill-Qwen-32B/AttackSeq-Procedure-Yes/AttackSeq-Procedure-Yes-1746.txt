Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader during the Lateral Movement phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let me go through each tactic mentioned:

1. **Reconnaissance**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded into memory without writing to disk. They gathered output files and then deleted them. This is part of the Discovery phase, which is under the Reconnaissance tactic.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploited IIS servers using deserialization attacks, including a 0-day.

3. **Execution**: They executed memory-resident malware called NodeIISWeb.

4. **Persistence**: They used web shells and a custom framework, NodeIISWeb, which operates in-memory. They removed disk tools after use, focusing on stealth.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They used PotatoEx.dll and other techniques like DLL injection and token manipulation.

6. **Defense Evasion**: Actively interfered with logging, evaded EDRs, and used in-memory operations to avoid detection.

7. **Credential Access**: Modified login pages to steal credentials.

8. **Discovery**: Used SharpHound and PowerSploit in memory, retrieved output, then deleted them.

9. **Command and Control**: NodeIISWeb provided backdoor functionality, allowing file/dir manipulation, system info, DLL loading, and code injection.

Now, the question is about the Lateral Movement phase. The question asks if TG1021 would access shared folders over SMB and drop NodeIISWeb to compromise more servers.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of SMB or lateral movement tactics. The report details how they used SharpHound and PowerSploit for discovery, but after that, the focus is on using NodeIISWeb as a web shell and in-memory operations. They didn't mention using SMB for lateral movement. Instead, their persistence and execution were focused on in-memory techniques, which suggests they might prefer methods that don't involve traditional file-based lateral movement.

Moreover, the report states that TG1021 removed disk-resident tools after use, which indicates a preference for stealth and in-memory operations. This behavior is more aligned with avoiding detection rather than using SMB, which could be more noisy or leave traces.

So, considering the information, it's less likely that they would use SMB for lateral movement. They seem to rely on web-based methods and in-memory techniques, which are more stealthy. Therefore, the answer is probably "No."

The analysis of the CTI report indicates that TG1021 primarily used in-memory techniques and web-based methods for persistence and execution, avoiding traditional file-based lateral movement. They focused on stealth by removing disk tools and using NodeIISWeb as a web shell. There's no mention of SMB usage for lateral movement. Therefore, it's unlikely they would use SMB for this purpose.

Final Answer: B: No
