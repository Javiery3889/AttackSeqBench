Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Infamous Chisel automatically exfiltrates collected files using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Infamous Chisel's netd component collects files from application and data directories, specifically those with communication data. That's under the Collection tactic. So, they're gathering data, which is the first part of the question.

Next, looking at the Command and Control section, it says that the db component provides SCP functionality, and td is deployed alongside the malware, providing a Tor hidden service that relays connections to the SSH program. Also, the malware offers a local Socks connection for db, which acts as an SSH server and client.

So, after collecting the files, the malware uses the Tor hidden service (td) to relay connections. Then, it uses SSH via the db component. That seems like the exfiltration process would involve Tor for anonymity and SSH for secure transfer. The report doesn't explicitly say it's done at regular intervals, but the setup suggests that once the data is collected, it's sent out using these mechanisms.

Putting it together, the sequence is Collection -> Command and Control (Tor and SSH). So, the answer should be yes, it does exfiltrate using Tor followed by SSH.

The CTI report indicates that Infamous Chisel collects communication data and uses a Tor hidden service alongside SSH for command and control. This setup implies that after collection, exfiltration occurs via these methods, likely at regular intervals.

Final Answer: A
