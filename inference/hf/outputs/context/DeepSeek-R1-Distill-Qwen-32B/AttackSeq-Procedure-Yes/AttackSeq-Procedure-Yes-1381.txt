Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether cybercriminals would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting MQTT after using Shodan and Censys. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that during the Discovery phase, they found various services on medical network perimeters. Specifically, it talks about outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces. Additionally, there are medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that use MQTT and are discoverable online. This suggests that these devices are accessible and could be exploited.

The "Others" section adds context about the threat landscape. It states that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017. Also, APT actors targeted pharmaceutical companies with malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to steal data, indicating an interest in intellectual property or business plans. The report recommends measures like removing medical data from public access, updating software, and not connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

Now, the question is asking if, after using Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources, cybercriminals would likely uncover outdated Building Management systems or MQTT devices. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Shodan and Censys are tools used for discovering internet-facing devices and services. They can identify exposed systems, which aligns with the Discovery tactic in MITRE ATT&CK. The report explicitly mentions that these tools were used to find such resources, including the specific systems and devices mentioned.

Given that the report details the presence of outdated systems and MQTT devices, it's logical that after discovering these resources, cybercriminals would indeed target them. The fact that these systems are outdated and have unprotected interfaces makes them prime targets for exploitation. The report also suggests that such vulnerabilities are common and have been exploited in the past, as evidenced by the malware statistics and APT activities.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes because the report supports the idea that these systems are discoverable and would be targeted after initial reconnaissance with tools like Shodan and Censys.

The CTI report indicates that cybercriminals would likely target outdated Building Management systems and medical devices using MQTT after discovering them with Shodan and Censys, as these systems are vulnerable and have been previously exploited.

Final Answer: A: Yes
