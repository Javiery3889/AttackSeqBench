Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the INOCNATION malware uses encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard libraries for C2 communications. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the malware used several defense evasion techniques. Specifically, it talks about XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation. These are all methods to hide its activities and avoid detection. 

Looking at the Execution section, the malware executed a malicious DLL payload that was obfuscated and rebuilt. It also used anti-behavioral analysis techniques, like checking mouse cursor positions to detect sandboxes. Additionally, the malware had a mangled MZ header to deceive security products. 

In the Defense Evasion section, it's noted that the malware used XOR obfuscation for components and strings, along with string stacking obfuscation using Unicode strings. It also mentions multiple layers of obfuscation for command and control traffic. 

The question is about whether the malware uses encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS and Windows' standard libraries for C2. The report doesn't explicitly state that they use HTTPS or SSL/TLS, but it does mention that the C2 traffic had multiple layers of obfuscation. 

I know that using HTTPS is a common method for C2 to encrypt traffic, making it harder for defenders to inspect. However, the report doesn't specify whether they used standard libraries or custom methods. The fact that they used multiple layers of obfuscation suggests they might be trying to hide the traffic, possibly using encryption. But without explicit mention of SSL/TLS or HTTPS, I can't be certain. 

Looking at the answer choices, it's a yes or no question. The report doesn't provide direct evidence, but the use of obfuscation layers might imply encrypted communication. However, since it's not explicitly stated, I'm leaning towards the answer being no, because the report doesn't confirm the use of HTTPS or SSL/TLS specifically.

The INOCNATION malware employed multiple layers of obfuscation for its command and control traffic, including XOR and string stacking techniques. While these methods suggest efforts to hide communications, the report does not explicitly mention the use of encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS or Windows' standard libraries. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not confirmed that the malware uses these specific encryption methods.

Final Answer: B: No
