Okay, so I need to figure out whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C before compressing and sending them. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Vyveva's backdoor has several capabilities. Under the Discovery tactic, it can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), list running processes (T1057), get system information like computer name, OS version, etc. (T1082), local IP address (T1016), and system time and time zone (T1124). So, it's definitely gathering a lot of system info.

Now, the question is about collecting files from removable media. The report doesn't explicitly mention anything about removable media. It talks about file exfiltration (T1041) and that the backdoor can exfiltrate data to the C&C server. But does that include monitoring for new devices like USB drives?

Looking at the TTPs listed, under Exfiltration, it's T1041, which is about transferring data. But T1041 doesn't specify the method or trigger for exfiltration. The report also mentions that the backdoor can execute 23 commands, including file upload and timestomping. So, it can upload files, but does it specifically target removable media?

The "Others" section says that Vyveva features capabilities for file exfiltration, timestomping, and gathering victim information. It also mentions that the backdoor's components include an installer, loader, and main payload, with the installer ensuring persistence and storing configuration in the registry. There's no mention of monitoring for removable media or specific commands related to that.

So, while Vyveva can exfiltrate files, the report doesn't provide evidence that it actively collects files from newly inserted removable media. It might collect files in general, but without specific details about monitoring for new devices, I can't assume that feature is present.

Therefore, the answer is likely No, because the report doesn't indicate that Vyveva has the capability to detect and collect files from removable media specifically.

The CTI report details Vyveva's capabilities, including file exfiltration and system information gathering, but does not mention monitoring for removable media. Without explicit evidence of such functionality, it's unlikely Vyveva collects files from newly inserted devices.

Final Answer: B
