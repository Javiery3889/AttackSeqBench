Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the StellarParticle campaign is likely to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations before using them to access cloud resources. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the tactics used by the StellarParticle campaign, which is associated with COZY BEAR. The report is structured by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, so I'll go through each section to understand the attack sequence.

Starting with Initial Access, the report mentions that they used SSH with a local account, RDP via port forwarding, VPNs, and exported saved passwords from Chrome. So, they already have some methods to get into the network and gather credentials.

Moving on to Persistence, they used credential hopping, which means they move laterally using different credentials each time. They also used Delegated Administrator rights for O365 access and configured TrailBlazer for WMI persistence and GoldMax via crontab. They added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new ones. This shows they're pretty thorough in maintaining access.

Defense Evasion techniques include stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA and renaming utilities to look legitimate. They also renamed systems to match the victim's naming conventions. So, they're actively trying to avoid detection and use stolen credentials to get around security measures.

In the Discovery phase, they used tools like AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools to gather info from Active Directory. They also used tasklist.exe and probed external services. This tells me they're mapping out the network and looking for ways to move laterally or access more resources.

Lateral Movement involved using both privileged and non-privileged RDP accounts, depending on the target. So, they can move around the network using different levels of access as needed.

Collection phase mentions accessing data from Information Repositories, which could include sensitive data, credentials, etc.

Now, the question is about whether they would steal web session cookies after using credential hopping and setting up WMI persistence. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, under Defense Evasion, it explicitly states that they stole browser cookies to bypass MFA. That's a direct indication that they do steal web session cookies. Additionally, since they're using these cookies to bypass MFA, it's likely part of their credential access strategy to access cloud resources, which would be part of the Collection or maybe even Lateral Movement phases.

So, putting it together: they steal cookies (which are web session cookies) to bypass MFA, which is a form of credential access. This would allow them to access cloud resources without needing to compromise additional accounts, leveraging the stolen sessions instead.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, it's likely they would steal these cookies before using them for accessing cloud resources.

The StellarParticle campaign, as detailed in the CTI report, employs several tactics that support the likelihood of stealing web session cookies. Specifically, the report highlights their use of browser cookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA), a defense evasion technique. This indicates that they are actively using stolen credentials, including web session cookies, to access cloud resources. Therefore, it is plausible that they would steal these cookies before using them in credential access techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
