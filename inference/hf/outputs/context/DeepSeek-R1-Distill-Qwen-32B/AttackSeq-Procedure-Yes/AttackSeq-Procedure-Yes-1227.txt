Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Inception attackers are likely to exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that Inception uses a two-stage spear phishing process. The first stage is a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information, and the second stage sends a remote template to deliver a payload. So, the attack sequence starts with reconnaissance, then moves to execution.

In the Execution section, it says they deploy POWERSHOWER, a PowerShell backdoor. The report also mentions that the attackers use a remote template to deliver the payload. The Others section notes that Palo Alto Networks detects Inception remote template documents and the downloaded CVE-2017-11882 RTFs with malware verdicts. So, it seems like they're using these remote templates, which are related to CVE-2017-11882, to deliver the payload.

Now, the question is asking if after the reconnaissance phase, they exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates before deploying POWERSHOWER. From the report, the second spear phish contains a remote template to deliver the payload, which is POWERSHOWER. So the sequence is: Reconnaissance (first spear phish) → Exploit via remote template (CVE-2017-11882) → Deployment of POWERSHOWER.

Therefore, the answer should be yes because the report explicitly states that the second stage uses remote templates, which are associated with CVE-2017-11882, to deliver the backdoor. So the sequence is as described in the question.
</think>

The Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing approach. The first stage gathers information, and the second uses a remote template exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to deliver the POWERSHOWER backdoor. This aligns with the question's sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
