Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts using techniques described under Data from Removable Media. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that CosmicDuke is involved in several MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The question is about the 'Discovery' tactic, specifically whether it targets removable drives. 

Looking at the 'Discovery' section of the report: "CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including various document, archive, and other file types. It also targets non-English filenames, particularly those that include the words 'sifr' and 'sifer,' which are related to encryption ciphers in many languages."

So, the report explicitly states that CosmicDuke searches hard drives and network drives. It doesn't mention anything about removable drives like USBs or external hard drives. 

Now, the question is about whether it uses techniques under 'Data from Removable Media.' The MITRE ATT&CK technique T1557, Data from Removable Media, refers to adversaries collecting data from removable media such as USB drives. 

Since the report doesn't mention anything about removable drives, I can infer that CosmicDuke doesn't target them. The report only talks about hard drives and network drives. Therefore, the answer should be 'No' because there's no evidence in the report that supports the use of techniques related to removable media.

The CTI report details that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives but does not mention any activity related to removable drives. Therefore, it does not use techniques under Data from Removable Media.

Final Answer: B: No
