Okay, so I need to figure out whether the PowerShell command in the FHAPPI campaign runs base64 encoded code and if the malware uses PowerShell for further execution. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the initial access vector was a phishing email with a link to malware on a Geocities website. The malware was a VBScript encoded script. When executed, this script downloaded a .doc file and opened it, which then led to a PowerShell attack. The main payload was Poison Ivy, which was injected into the userinit.exe process.

Looking at the defense evasion tactics, the report states that the campaign used multiple encodings and wraps, including multilayered base64 encoding. The attack was fileless, which means it didn't rely on traditional file-based malware, thus avoiding known signatures. This suggests that the attackers used encoding techniques to hide their malicious code.

Now, the question is about whether the PowerShell command runs base64 encoded code and if PowerShell is used for further execution. From the report, the VBScript downloaded a .doc file, which then executed a PowerShell attack. Since the campaign used multilayered base64 encoding, it's likely that the PowerShell command itself was encoded in base64 to evade detection. This is a common technique in APTs to obfuscate commands and avoid being caught by antivirus or intrusion detection systems.

Additionally, the fact that the attack was fileless supports the idea that the PowerShell script was used to execute the payload directly in memory, which is a typical method for such attacks. The use of base64 encoding would help in hiding the actual commands within the PowerShell script, making it harder for security tools to detect the malicious activity.

So, putting it all together, the VBScript likely executed a base64 encoded PowerShell command, which then proceeded to carry out the attack, including downloading the Poison Ivy payload. This aligns with the tactics described in the report, making it highly probable that the answer is yes.

The FHAPPI campaign utilized a VBScript that downloaded a .doc file, which executed a PowerShell attack. The campaign employed multilayered base64 encoding as part of its defense evasion tactics, indicating that the PowerShell command was likely encoded. This method is common in APTs to hide malicious activities. Therefore, it is probable that the PowerShell command ran base64 encoded code and that PowerShell was used for further execution.

Final Answer: A
