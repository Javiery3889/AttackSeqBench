Okay, so I need to figure out whether, after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance, it's likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that the cybercriminals used masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges related to medical keywords. They also used Shodan and Censys, which are specialized search engines for finding publicly available resources. The report specifically notes that they discovered non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication. These findings could be exploited for further reconnaissance.

So, the attack sequence here starts with reconnaissance using these tools. The tools are used to scan and identify potential entry points, which include various services on the network perimeter. The report highlights that they found outdated or vulnerable services, like the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printers. These are examples of outdated systems and medical devices that were discovered during this phase.

Now, looking at the question, it's asking if it's likely that such services would be found after using these tools. The answer choices are just Yes or No. Based on the report, the answer seems to be Yes because the tools are effective in uncovering these kinds of services. The report explicitly states that they found non-trivial ports and services, which implies that these tools successfully identified various services, including outdated ones.

I don't see any information in the report that would suggest otherwise. The "Others" section talks about malware and APTs, but that's more about the next steps after reconnaissance, not about the effectiveness of the tools used in the initial phase. The recommendations in the report, like removing data from public access and updating software, also support the idea that these services were indeed discovered and pose a risk.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Yes because the tools mentioned are known for discovering network services, and the report confirms that they found such services during reconnaissance.

The CTI report details the use of tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys for reconnaissance, which successfully identified various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices. The report explicitly mentions the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems and unauthenticated printers, confirming that these tools effectively uncover such vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is likely that these services would be discovered.

Final Answer: A
