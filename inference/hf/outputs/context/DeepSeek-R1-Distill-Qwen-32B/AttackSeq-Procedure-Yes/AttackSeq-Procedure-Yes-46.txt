Okay, so I need to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I'll start by analyzing the CTI report provided. The report describes a campaign where phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were used. These macros, when executed, lead to the delivery of Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

Looking at the attack sequence, the report mentions that upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute. This macro calls a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. The script then downloads and executes the payloads. So, the initial access is through the phishing email, which contains the Word document. Once the user opens the document, the VBS macro runs, leading to the execution of the PowerShell script and subsequent malware.

The question is asking if it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros after gaining initial access via the phishing email. From the report, it's clear that the VBS macro is a key part of the attack chain. The macro is embedded in the Word document, and upon execution, it triggers the next steps. Therefore, the answer should be yes because the report explicitly states that the VBS macro is executed when the document is opened.

I don't see any information in the report that suggests otherwise. The report doesn't mention any steps that would prevent the macro from executing, like macro disabling or other mitigations. It just describes the process as part of the attack. So, based on the information given, the answer should be A: Yes.

The CTI report details a campaign where phishing emails with malicious Word documents execute VBS macros upon opening, leading to malware delivery. The report confirms that the VBS macro is a critical step in the attack sequence. Therefore, it is likely that the campaign executes VBS macros after initial access.

Final Answer: A
