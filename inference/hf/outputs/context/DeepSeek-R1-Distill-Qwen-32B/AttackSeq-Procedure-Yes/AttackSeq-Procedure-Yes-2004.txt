Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the KopiLuwak backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C2 server and also download files to the infected machine after it communicates using HTTP POST requests. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to understand the attack sequence and the capabilities of the backdoor.

First, the report mentions that the Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. The dropper was disguised as an invitation to a G20 meeting, which is the initial access vector. Once executed, the dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. The JavaScript dropper then installs a decryptor that decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory. 

Looking at the execution phase, the dropper writes some files to %APPDATA% and sets up persistence via a scheduled task named PolicyConverter, which runs every 10 minutes. The persistence mechanism ensures that the backdoor remains active on the infected system.

In terms of defense evasion, the report notes that the dropper doesn't have obfuscation or anti-analysis features, but the JavaScript dropper does fingerprint the system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion. The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites, and the HTTP User-Agent is hardcoded, which is a change from previous variants.

The discovery phase involves the JavaScript dropper, Scr.js, executing commands to gather system information, such as checking for Kaspersky directories and performing a traceroute to Google. This suggests that the backdoor is gathering information about the infected system.

For command and control, the report states that the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests. Importantly, it mentions that the backdoor can receive commands from the C&C server, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands. 

So, putting this together, the backdoor's capabilities include exfiltrating data (which would involve sending files to the C2 server) and downloading files to the infected machine. The question is asking if, after communication via HTTP POST, the backdoor can perform both actions. According to the report, yes, it can do both: exfiltrate data and download files.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, which is option A.

The CTI report details that the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with C2 servers using HTTP POST requests and is capable of exfiltrating data and downloading files. 

Final Answer: A
