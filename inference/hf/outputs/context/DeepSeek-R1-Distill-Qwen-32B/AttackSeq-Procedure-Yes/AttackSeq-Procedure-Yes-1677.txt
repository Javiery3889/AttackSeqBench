Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the WastedLocker ransomware, after being deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase, will go on to encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom in the Impact phase. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I'll start by analyzing the CTI report provided. The report details an attack by the group Evil Corp using WastedLocker ransomware. The attack sequence is outlined using MITRE ATT&CK tactics, so I'll go through each phase to understand the flow.

Reconnaissance: They used SocGholish on compromised websites to masquerade as a software update. That's the initial step to get into the network.

Initial Access: Victims received a zipped file with malicious JavaScript, which then executed another JS file via wscript.exe. This led to downloading more scripts, so the initial foothold is established.

Execution: They used Cobalt Strike with PowerShell to download a loader, which included a .NET injector called Donut. This executed the Cobalt Strike Beacon, which has various capabilities like command execution and privilege escalation.

Privilege Escalation: They used slui.exe and wmic.exe to escalate privileges, which is a common technique in ransomware attacks to gain higher-level access.

Defense Evasion: Here, they used PsExec to manage Windows Defender, disabling it, and stopped services before deploying WastedLocker. This phase is crucial because it sets the stage for the ransomware deployment without detection.

Credential Access: Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping, which helps in moving laterally and maintaining persistence.

Discovery: They used commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer to gather information about the network, which is typical before lateral movement.

Lateral Movement: Cobalt Strike Beacon was used to move across the network, injecting processes on remote machines.

Command and Control: The Beacon communicated with a C&C domain, which is part of the infrastructure for WastedLocker.

Now, the question is about the Impact phase. The report mentions that the attackers deployed WastedLocker ransomware, which is known for encrypting data and demanding ransoms. The report also states that the attackers targeted major U.S. corporations, including Fortune 500 companies, which suggests that the impact would be significant.

In the Defense Evasion phase, they used PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which are tactics to ensure the ransomware can execute without interference. Once the ransomware is deployed, the next logical step is encryption of files and systems, leading to disruption and ransom demands.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this sequence leads to the Impact phase as described. Since the report explicitly mentions the deployment of WastedLocker and the context of ransomware attacks typically involves encryption and ransom demands, it's highly likely that the Impact phase follows as described.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be A: Yes.

The CTI report details an attack by Evil Corp using WastedLocker ransomware, which follows a structured sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics. After the Defense Evasion phase, where PsExec is used to stop services and disable Windows Defender, the deployment of WastedLocker is confirmed. Given that WastedLocker is a ransomware known for encrypting data and demanding ransoms, and considering the high-profile targets, the Impact phase involving significant disruption and ransom demands is highly likely.

Final Answer: A
