Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malicious macro code in the XLS document will first drop a Crimson RAT downloader and then download the fully functional Crimson RAT from the specified IP address. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the malicious document had macro code which executed to drop the first payload, a Crimson RAT downloader. This downloader then downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246. So, the sequence here is: macro code executes, drops the downloader, which then fetches the RAT.

Looking at the question, it's asking if the macro code will first drop the downloader before downloading the RAT. The answer choices are Yes or No. From the report, it's clear that the process is exactly as described: macro code leads to the downloader, which then gets the RAT. 

Additionally, the "Others" section mentions a similar document from early August, 'MoFA-MoDAfghanistan.xls', which also used a macro to download a payload. This suggests a consistent TTP where the initial payload is a downloader that fetches the main RAT. 

So, putting it all together, the attack sequence supports the scenario described in the question. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The CTI report details that the malicious macro code in the XLS document executes to drop a Crimson RAT downloader, which subsequently downloads the fully functional RAT from the specified IP. This aligns with the question's scenario, confirming the sequence.

Final Answer: A
