Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius is likely to deploy custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for execution before achieving persistence by registering it as a service and deploying webshells. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each tactic as described.

1. **Initial Access**: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, using exploits like FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection. Successful exploitation allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution**: They deployed custom malware, specifically the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. This backdoor was used for exfiltrating data and deploying more malware. It was also registered as a service for persistence.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The webshells were obfuscated, and the backdoor had features to update itself and delete traces.

4. **Lateral Movement**: They used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts, using tools for credential harvesting.

5. **Command and Control**: The backdoor communicated over HTTP with C2 servers, following commands for updates, recon, file downloads, and self-deletion.

6. **Impact**: They deployed wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD to destroy data.

Now, the question is about the sequence of TTPs after initial access. The question asks if Agrius will deploy custom malware (like 'IPsec Helper') for execution before achieving persistence by registering it as a service and deploying webshells.

Looking at the report, after initial access via webshells, the next step was execution. Execution involved deploying the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. This backdoor was then registered as a service for persistence. So the sequence is: initial access (webshells) → execution (deploying backdoor) → persistence (registering as service).

The question is whether they deploy the malware for execution before achieving persistence. From the report, yes, they deploy the malware first, which then is used to achieve persistence. So the sequence is execution before persistence.

The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. Based on the report, the answer should be A: Yes.

The analysis of the CTI report indicates that Agrius first gains initial access through webshells, then deploys the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution, and subsequently registers it for persistence. This sequence confirms that custom malware is deployed before achieving persistence.

Final Answer: A
