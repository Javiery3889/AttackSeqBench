Okay, so I need to figure out whether the BlueDelta campaign first exploited the Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then used other Roundcube vulnerabilities for discovery activities. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each section.

Reconnaissance: The campaign targeted Ukrainian government entities and a military-related organization. They used three CVEs in Roundcube: 2020-35730, 2020-12641, and 2021-44026. These were used for running scripts that redirected emails, did reconnaissance, and exfiltrated data like session cookies and address books.

Initial Access: The report says they exploited CVE-2020-35730 in Roundcube to gain initial access. This was done without needing the recipient to interact with the email, which is a key point. They also used another zero-day in Outlook, but that's a separate vector.

Execution: They executed scripts via Roundcube vulnerabilities, which redirected emails and did reconnaissance on the server. They also used the Outlook exploit to impersonate victims.

Defense Evasion: They used obfuscation and encoded data to avoid detection.

Credential Access: They exploited Roundcube to get OS credentials like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

Collection: They set up a filter in Roundcube to forward emails.

Command and Control: Used web protocols with encoding.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrated data over alternative protocols, including session cookies, address books, and database info.

Now, the question is asking if they first used CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then other Roundcube vulnerabilities for discovery. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, under Initial Access, it's clear that CVE-2020-35730 was used to gain initial access. Then, in the Execution phase, they used the same Roundcube vulnerabilities (including the other two CVEs) to run scripts that did reconnaissance, which is part of the discovery process. So the sequence is: Initial Access via CVE-2020-35730, followed by using other Roundcube vulnerabilities for execution and reconnaissance.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes because the report explicitly states that they first used CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then exploited other Roundcube vulnerabilities for discovery activities.
</think>

The BlueDelta campaign first used CVE-2020-35730 to gain initial access to the Roundcube mail servers. Subsequently, they exploited other Roundcube vulnerabilities for reconnaissance and execution, which are part of the discovery process. 

Final Answer: A
