Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Office document used by the OceanLotus group in their KerrDown campaign would contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that KerrDown is delivered through two methods: Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros and RAR archives with DLL side-loading. The Office documents are used as a delivery vector, but the report doesn't explicitly say whether they contain images instructing the user to enable macros.

I know that in many phishing campaigns, attackers use social engineering tactics to trick users into enabling macros. This often involves images or messages within the document that say something like, "Enable macros to view this content properly." So, it's a common technique to increase the success rate of the attack.

The report does mention that the VBS decode function was reused from Motobit, which is used to decode base64 blobs. This suggests that the macros in the Office documents are indeed executing some form of encoded payload. The payload is then decrypted using DES and executed in memory, which is a common method to avoid detection.

However, the report doesn't explicitly state whether the Office documents include such an image. It just says that the documents have malicious macros. So, while it's a common practice to include such instructions, the report doesn't confirm it. Therefore, I can't assume it's there unless the report says so.

Looking at the question, it's asking if it's "likely" that the Office document contains such an image. Since the report doesn't mention it, I can't be certain. The delivery method is via macros, but whether they use an image to trick the user is not specified. So, the answer would be that it's not necessarily the case based on the information provided.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "is it likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim..." Given that the delivery method is via macros, and knowing that attackers often use such tactics, maybe it's a reasonable assumption. But the report doesn't provide evidence of that. So, perhaps the answer is no because the report doesn't mention it, even though it's a common practice.

Alternatively, maybe the report's mention of the VBS decode function implies that the macros are executing code, which might require the user to enable them, but again, the presence of an image isn't confirmed.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the report doesn't specify the use of an image, so I shouldn't assume it. On the other hand, it's a common tactic, so maybe it's implied. But since the question is about what's likely based on the report, and the report doesn't mention it, the answer should be no.
</think>

The CTI report details the delivery methods of KerrDown but does not explicitly mention the inclusion of an image instructing the victim to enable macros. While it's a common tactic, the absence of such information in the report means we cannot confirm it. Therefore, based on the provided details, it's not likely that the Office document contains such an image.

Final Answer: B: No
