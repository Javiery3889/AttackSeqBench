Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Infamous Chisel is likely to deploy tcpdump after discovering files and before exfiltrating them. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the netd component is used for discovery. It enumerates data directories, collects GPS info, lists installed packages, and gathers system info. It also does IP scanning on the local network. So, the discovery phase is pretty thorough.

Next, the collection phase: netd automatically collects files based on predefined extensions and from app and data directories, especially those with communication data. So, it's gathering specific types of files.

Then, for exfiltration, it uses a Tor hidden service and SSH connections at regular intervals. The report doesn't mention anything about monitoring network traffic or using tools like tcpdump. The exfiltration is direct, using the established Tor and SSH channels.

Tcpdump is a network monitoring tool used for packet capturing. If the malware wanted to monitor traffic, it would likely be part of the collection or defense evasion tactics. But the report doesn't list tcpdump as one of the utilities or activities. The utilities mentioned are dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag, and shell scripts. Tcpdump isn't among them.

Also, the question is about whether it's likely to deploy tcpdump after discovery and before exfiltration. Since the report doesn't mention any such activity, and the exfiltration is already handled through Tor and SSH, there's no indication that tcpdump is used. The attack sequence doesn't include network monitoring beyond the initial IP scanning for discovery.

Therefore, it's unlikely that Infamous Chisel uses tcpdump in this scenario.

The CTI report details Infamous Chisel's activities, which include discovery, collection, and exfiltration. While it mentions tools like nmap for scanning, there's no mention of tcpdump or network monitoring beyond initial discovery. The exfiltration uses Tor and SSH without needing additional monitoring. Thus, deploying tcpdump isn't indicated.

Final Answer: B: No
