Okay, so I need to figure out whether the BlackEnergy 3 malware, after communicating with its C2 server using HTTP to send localization data and keyboard layout info, will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information as part of its exfiltration process. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report outlines several MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by the malware. Let's break down the relevant parts.

The report mentions that during the Execution phase, the malware uses a Visual Basic macro in an Excel document to execute a PE32 file. This file then drops two executables: FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe. FONTCACHE.DAT is described as a network sniffer. So, the malware does have a component that acts as a network sniffer.

In the Defense Evasion section, the report talks about various anti-debugging techniques, but that's more about how the malware hides itself rather than its functionality. The Persistence section mentions that the malware registers itself to run on startup, which is about maintaining access.

Looking at the Discovery phase, the malware uses GetAdaptersInfo() to gather network information, which is part of preparing for lateral movement. The Lateral Movement section says the malware is designed for lateral movement, sending data to servers in Europe. The Command and Control part states that it communicates via HTTP, sending localization data and keyboard layout info.

So, putting this together: the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP, sending specific data. It also has a network sniffer component (FONTCACHE.DAT) that's dropped during execution. The question is whether after the initial C2 communication, the malware will use this sniffer to gather more information and exfiltrate it.

From the report, FONTCACHE.DAT is a network sniffer, which suggests it's used to capture network traffic. Since the malware is designed for lateral movement and exfiltration, it's logical that after establishing communication, it would use the sniffer to gather additional data, which it would then send back to the C2 server. This aligns with typical APT behavior where initial communication is followed by data collection and exfiltration.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The BlackEnergy 3 malware, after establishing communication with its C2 server via HTTP, uses a network sniffer component (FONTCACHE.DAT) to gather information, which it then exfiltrates. This behavior is consistent with its design for lateral movement and data collection.

Final Answer: A
