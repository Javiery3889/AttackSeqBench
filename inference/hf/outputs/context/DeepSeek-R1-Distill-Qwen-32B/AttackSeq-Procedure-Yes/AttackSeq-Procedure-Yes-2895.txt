Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'yty' framework exfiltrates the data it collects back to the C2 server using automated methods. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to understand the attack sequence and see if it aligns with the question.

First, the report mentions that the 'yty' framework is a modular malware with several components. The initial access is through a malicious Excel document, 'Circular.xls', which uses macros to execute an executable. Then, there are two downloaders: Downloader 1 and Downloader 2. Downloader 2 has anti-sandbox features and ensures only one instance runs. 

Persistence is established via a secondary macro in the Excel file, which helps in maintaining access. For defense evasion, the framework uses junk code and anti-sandbox techniques, and it even creates logs, similar to the EHDevel framework. 

In the collection phase, the framework has several plugins: 'vstservice.exe' for document listing, 'abode.exe' for file exfiltration, 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging, 'dspcheck.exe' for screenshots, and 'mboard.exe' for system info. So, these plugins are responsible for gathering different types of data.

The command and control (C2) section says that the framework uses a football-themed strategy to disguise traffic. It downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host and sends beacon messages with system info. The C2 server then responds with instructions. 

The 'Others' section notes that the Donot Team uses domains similar to legitimate ones and relies on subdomains. Their TTPs are similar to EHDevel, indicating they're the same group. The evolution from EHDevel to 'yty' shows they're improving their tools.

Now, the question is about whether 'yty' exfiltrates data like file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots using automated methods. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, the collection phase includes plugins that gather data, and the C2 section mentions that the framework sends beacon messages with system info and receives instructions. The 'abode.exe' plugin is specifically for file exfiltration, which suggests that it's designed to send files back. Since the C2 communication is automated, it's likely that once the data is collected, it's sent back automatically as part of the beaconing process.

So, putting it together: the framework collects data using plugins and then exfiltrates it via the C2 server using automated methods. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The 'yty' framework includes plugins for collecting various data types and communicates with a C2 server using automated beaconing. The presence of an exfiltration plugin ('abode.exe') and the automated C2 communication suggest that data is exfiltrated automatically.

Final Answer: A
