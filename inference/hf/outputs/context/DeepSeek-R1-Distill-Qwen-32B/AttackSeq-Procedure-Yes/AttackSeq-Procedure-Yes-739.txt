Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers in the CTI report are likely to verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for a 2-step verification code after using images in phishing emails. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand the attack sequence. The report mentions that the attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security. They also used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images. Additionally, there was a hidden tracking image to alert them when a target opened the email.

Now, the question is about what happens after they use these image-based phishing emails. Specifically, whether they would verify the credentials in real-time and ask for a 2-step verification code. 

Looking at the report, it says that the attackers sent fake security alerts claiming unauthorized access attempts. They also created fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials. So, when a victim enters their credentials on these fake pages, the attackers would receive them. 

Since the attackers are using these fake pages, it's likely that they can capture the credentials as they are entered. If the victim's account has 2-step verification enabled, the attackers might prompt for the code next. This would allow them to gain full access without needing to change the password, which aligns with the persistence tactic mentioned in the report where they didn't change passwords to remain undetected.

So, putting it together, after capturing the initial credentials via the image-based phishing, the attackers would likely verify them and then ask for the 2-step code to fully compromise the account. This makes sense because it's a common tactic in phishing campaigns targeting accounts with 2FA enabled.

The attackers used image-based phishing emails to bypass security, capturing victims' credentials. Since they created fake pages to trick users into entering details, they likely verify credentials in real-time. If 2-step verification is enabled, prompting for the code would allow full access, aligning with their tactics. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
