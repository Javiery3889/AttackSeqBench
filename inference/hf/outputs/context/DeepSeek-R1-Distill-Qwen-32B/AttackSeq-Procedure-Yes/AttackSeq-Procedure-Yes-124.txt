Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius, the threat group described in the CTI report, eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle' that turned into ransomware to destroy data. The question is asking if this is likely based on the attack sequence detailed in the report.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by Agrius. Let's break down each tactic:

1. **Initial Access**: They exploited public-facing applications, using known exploits like FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection. Successful exploitation allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution**: They deployed custom malware, specifically a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor was used for exfiltrating data and deploying more malware. It could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

3. **Persistence**: They used webshells and registered 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence. This means the backdoor would continue running even after reboots, ensuring long-term access.

4. **Defense Evasion**: The webshells were obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding, and the backdoor had features to update itself and delete traces, helping it avoid detection.

5. **Lateral Movement**: They used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and moved laterally using compromised accounts and publicly available tools for credential harvesting.

6. **Command and Control**: The 'IPsec Helper' communicated over HTTP with C2 servers, receiving commands like updating relays, sending recon info, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is about whether they deployed wipers like 'Apostle' that became ransomware. From the report, I don't see any mention of wipers or ransomware. The activities described are about initial access, execution, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and C2 communication. The backdoor's functions include exfiltration, command execution, file upload, and self-deletion, but nothing about data destruction or encryption for ransom.

The report doesn't indicate that Agrius's activities included wiping data or ransom demands. Their main goals seem to be data exfiltration and maintaining access, not destruction or extortion. Therefore, it's unlikely they deployed such wipers or ransomware based on the information provided.

So, the answer should be B: No.

The CTI report details Agrius's tactics, which include initial access, execution, persistence, evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. Their activities focus on data exfiltration and maintaining access through a backdoor, without any indication of deploying wipers or ransomware. Therefore, it's unlikely they used such tools.

Final Answer: B
