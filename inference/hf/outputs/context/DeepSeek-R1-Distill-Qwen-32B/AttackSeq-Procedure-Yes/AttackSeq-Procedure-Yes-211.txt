Okay, so I need to figure out whether the custom screenshot tool used by the Harvester group will capture user activities, save them as password-protected ZIP archives, and delete any archives older than a week. The question is asking if this sequence of actions is likely after the group blended their C&C activities using legitimate infrastructure.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report mentions that Harvester used a custom backdoor called Backdoor.Graphon, a custom downloader, and a custom screenshot tool. The execution phase involved deploying these tools to execute commands, capture user activities, and enable remote access. 

In the defense evasion section, it says they used legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure to blend their C&C activities. They also used a decoy URL to confuse users. The command and control section confirms that the backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with C&C servers on Microsoft infrastructure, controlling input and output streams, and sending encrypted data back.

The exfiltration part states that the custom screenshot tool saves captured screenshots into password-protected ZIP archives. However, the report doesn't mention anything about deleting archives older than a week. It only talks about saving them as ZIPs. 

So, the question is about whether the tool deletes old archives. The report doesn't provide information on data retention policies or deletion practices. It only mentions the saving mechanism. Therefore, without evidence of such a deletion process, we can't assume it's part of their TTPs. 

The answer choices are Yes or No. Since the report doesn't support the deletion part, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details the Harvester group's use of a custom screenshot tool that saves captured data in password-protected ZIP archives. However, it does not mention any process for deleting archives older than a week. Without evidence of such a practice, it's not reasonable to conclude that deletion occurs. 

Final Answer: B: No
