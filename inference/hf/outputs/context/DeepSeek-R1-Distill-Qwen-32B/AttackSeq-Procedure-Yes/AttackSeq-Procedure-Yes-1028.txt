Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gamaredon, after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by the Gamaredon group. Let's go through each tactic mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: They send spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, using compromised email accounts to make the emails look trustworthy.
2. **Execution**: They use scripting like Batch files and VBScript, and tools like rundll32 and CreateProcess to execute malicious payloads. They rely on users opening these attachments.
3. **Persistence**: They use scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents to maintain persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion**: They obfuscate files, modify registry keys to disable security features, use code signing, and deobfuscate/decrypt strings in modules.
5. **Discovery**: Their backdoors automatically list interesting files, like Office documents, for future exfiltration.
6. **Lateral Movement**: They inject macros into Word/Excel docs and use Outlook VBA macros to send malicious emails to other targets.
7. **Command and Control**: Uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
8. **Exfiltration**: Modules automatically upload harvested documents to C&C servers.

The question is about whether, after lateral movement via Outlook VBA macros, they'll deploy scripts to scan for sensitive docs. 

Looking at the **Discovery** tactic, it says their backdoors automatically list interesting files for exfiltration. That suggests they do have mechanisms in place to scan for sensitive documents. Additionally, under **Exfiltration**, it mentions modules automatically uploading these documents, which implies that once they've moved laterally, they proceed to collect and exfiltrate data.

Moreover, the "Others" section notes that their tools are designed to gather sensitive information and spread quickly. They don't hide much, focusing on rapid data exfiltration. This indicates a clear intent to collect data once access is gained.

So, putting it together: After moving laterally, they would likely use their existing discovery mechanisms to scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The Gamaredon group's tactics include using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement, followed by mechanisms to automatically scan and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Their tools are designed for rapid data collection, supporting the likelihood of deploying such scripts.

Final Answer: A
