Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malware "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for collecting sensitive information after achieving persistence. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, looking at the CTI report, the initial access is through spear-phishing emails and a fake blog site. The malware is embedded in PowerPoint presentations that are disguised as self-extracting archives. When opened, they install the malware. The persistence mechanism involves creating a shortcut file 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

The 'Others' section mentions that the campaign targets high-profile entities like intelligence services, military, embassies, and government institutions. The malware uses Python embedded into Windows executables, which is unusual. They also have infrastructure for Mac OS X, Unix, and Android, suggesting a broader capability. Indicators of Compromise include specific domains and a known infection artifact. Kaspersky detects it as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua.

Now, the question is about whether "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a USB device. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to determine if the report provides any information about these specific TTPs. The report mentions that the malware is used for espionage, given the targets are high-profile. It's detected as a Trojan-Spy, which typically implies it's designed to spy on users, collect information, and exfiltrate data.

Trojan-Spy malware often includes keylogging capabilities to capture sensitive information like passwords, credentials, etc. Additionally, some malware uses USB devices as a method to exfiltrate data, especially in environments with limited internet access or as a stealthy method.

The report doesn't explicitly state that "Machete" logs keystrokes or uses USB devices, but given its classification as a spy Trojan and the nature of its targets, it's plausible that it includes such features. Espionage malware often employs multiple data collection methods to ensure it can gather as much information as possible, including both network-based and physical methods like USB.

Therefore, considering the context and the nature of the malware, it's likely that "Machete" does log keystrokes and use USB devices for data collection.

The malware "Machete" is classified as a Trojan-Spy, indicating its purpose is espionage. Given its targets are high-profile entities, it's reasonable to infer it uses keylogging and USB exfiltration for data collection. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
