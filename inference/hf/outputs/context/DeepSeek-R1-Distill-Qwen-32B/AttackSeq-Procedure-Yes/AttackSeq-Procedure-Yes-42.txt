Okay, so I need to figure out whether the KONNI malware steals files from the local system before uploading data to the C2. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections. The C2 infrastructure is hosted by 000webhost, and the malware connects to a specific URI: <c2-domain>/login.php. Over time, more .php files became available for registration, uploading, and downloading files. 

Looking at the Exfiltration section, it says the malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure. It doesn't explicitly mention stealing files from the local system, but it does talk about uploading data. 

Wait, the question is about whether the malware steals files before uploading. The report mentions that the malware is capable of stealing keystrokes and credentials from browsers. It also says that it uploads stolen data like keystrokes and screenshots. 

So, does stealing keystrokes and screenshots count as stealing files? Keystrokes are data captured in real-time, not necessarily files. Screenshots are images captured and stored temporarily, which might be saved as files before upload. 

But the question is about stealing files from the local system. The report doesn't explicitly state that the malware steals existing files, like documents or other files. It focuses on keystrokes and screenshots, which are generated by the malware's activity rather than existing files on the system.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not clear that the malware steals local files. It seems to collect data through its own activities rather than accessing and exfiltrating existing files.
</think>

The KONNI malware's reported activities include stealing keystrokes and capturing screenshots, which are generated during its operation rather than stealing existing files from the system. The report does not mention the malware accessing or exfiltrating local files. 

Final Answer: B: No
