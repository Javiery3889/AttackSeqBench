Okay, so I need to figure out whether PROMETHIUM malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks before exfiltration. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Collection phase, PROMETHIUM searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files. It uses a document search module to find files with specific extensions, compresses them into an archive, and then encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server.

Wait, the question is about whether the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks. The report says it encodes the archive before sending, but it doesn't specify the type of encoding or if it splits the files into chunks. 

I know that some malware uses techniques like encryption or encoding to hide data, and sometimes they split files to avoid detection by network monitoring tools. But the report doesn't explicitly mention splitting into chunks. It only mentions encoding. So, the question is whether the answer is yes or no based on the given information.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Since the report says the archive is encoded, but doesn't mention splitting into chunks, I can't assume that. So, the answer would be No because the report doesn't provide evidence of splitting into chunks, only encoding.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that PROMETHIUM encodes the archives before exfiltration but does not mention splitting them into chunks. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that the malware splits the archives into chunks.

Final Answer: B: No
