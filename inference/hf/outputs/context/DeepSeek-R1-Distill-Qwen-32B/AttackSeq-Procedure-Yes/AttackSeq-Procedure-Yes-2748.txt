Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malware used input capture to collect sensitive information like passwords and account data from various applications. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the attackers used spear phishing emails with compressed executables or links. The malware, based on Hawkeye spyware, was designed to collect data like passwords, keystrokes, and screenshots. So, the initial purpose of the malware is clearâ€”it's meant to gather sensitive information.

Looking at the Execution phase, the malware self-deployed and used anti-debugging and timeout techniques. It started collecting data, including keystrokes, clipboard data, and account data from applications and clients. This directly points to the use of input capture because keystrokes are a form of input capture. Input capture typically refers to monitoring keystrokes to record what users type, which would include passwords and other sensitive information.

The Credential Access section also states that the malware collected sensitive info like FileZilla FTP credentials, browser data, messaging clients, email clients, and license info. Collecting this kind of data from various applications would likely involve capturing inputs as users interact with these applications.

So, putting it together, the malware's behavior aligns with using input capture techniques to gather the necessary data. The report explicitly mentions keystrokes and clipboard data, which are methods of input capture. Therefore, it's highly likely that input capture was used.
