Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Duke group is likely to use Mimikatz PowerShell for Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks after Seaduke evades defenses. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the Duke group's activities using Seaduke malware. The attack sequence starts with Initial Access, where they send emails with Cozyduke payloads. Then, in Defense Evasion, Seaduke uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation. The Collection phase involves retrieving system info, updating configurations, and file operations. Command and Control uses HTTP/HTTPS with Base64 and encryption. Exfiltration uses cloud services and secure deletion.

The question is about whether, after evading defenses, the Duke group uses Mimikatz for credential access before using Seaduke to retrieve info and delete itself. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, Seaduke itself is described as having the capability to retrieve detailed bot/system information and securely delete itself. It doesn't mention the use of Mimikatz or any other tools for credential access. The report focuses on Seaduke's functionalities, which include data collection and deletion, but doesn't indicate the use of additional tools like Mimikatz for credential theft.

Mimikatz is a tool often used for credential dumping, including Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks. If the Duke group were using it, the report might mention it, especially since it's a significant TTP. However, the report doesn't list Mimikatz as part of their toolkit. Instead, it talks about Seaduke's built-in features for data exfiltration and deletion.

Therefore, based on the information given, the Duke group's activities as described don't include using Mimikatz. They rely on Seaduke's capabilities for their operations. So, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details the Duke group's use of Seaduke malware, which includes functionalities for data collection and secure deletion. There is no mention of Mimikatz or any other tools for credential access. Since the report focuses on Seaduke's capabilities without indicating the use of Mimikatz, the Duke group is not likely to use it in this scenario.

Final Answer: B: No
