Okay, so I need to figure out whether Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability and the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement after achieving persistence. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Stuxnet's initial access was through the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability using .LNK files on USB drives. Then, during execution, it runs malicious code on local and remote systems. It uses kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, and it replaces legitimate system files to maintain persistence. 

The persistence section says it installs kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, uses a boot start service, and modifies system files and registry keys. So, after persistence, what does it do next?

Looking at the Privilege Escalation section, Stuxnet used two zero-days: MS10-073 and MS10-092. These were used to escalate privileges, not for lateral movement. The report doesn't mention MS08-067 or MS10-061 at all. 

The Command and Control section talks about communication using HTTP, encrypted URLs, and an RPC server for peer-to-peer updates. But the RPC server is for receiving updates, not necessarily for moving laterally. 

So, the question is about lateral movement using those specific vulnerabilities. Since the report doesn't mention MS08-067 or MS10-061, and instead talks about using its own RPC server, I don't think Stuxnet used those vulnerabilities for lateral movement. Therefore, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details Stuxnet's attack sequence, which includes initial access via CVE-2010-2568, execution with kernel-mode drivers, persistence through system modifications, privilege escalation using MS10-073 and MS10-092, and command and control via encrypted HTTP. There is no mention of MS08-067 or MS10-061 being used for lateral movement. Instead, Stuxnet used its own RPC server for updates. Therefore, Stuxnet did not utilize these vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B: No
