Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware is likely to scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, looking at the CTI report, the attack sequence is outlined using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's break down each part relevant to the question.

The report mentions that during the Discovery phase, Gamaredon's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration. So, their malware is designed to look for specific types of files, like Office docs, which are likely to contain sensitive information.

Now, the question is about whether they scan all drives, including network shares. The answer choices are Yes or No. I need to determine if the report indicates that they do this.

In the report, under Discovery, it says they list "interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system." The term "system" here probably refers to the local system, not necessarily network drives. There's no explicit mention of scanning network shared drives. However, in the Lateral Movement section, it says they inject macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system and use Outlook to send emails to other targets. This suggests that they might access files on the network, but that's more about spreading the attack rather than data collection.

Additionally, under Exfiltration, it mentions that modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server. Again, it's about the documents they've already identified, not necessarily scanning all drives.

The report doesn't explicitly state that they scan all drives, including network ones. Their focus seems to be on specific file types and leveraging existing documents for persistence and lateral movement. They might not be conducting a broad scan of all drives, which could be more resource-intensive and potentially noisy.

So, considering the information, it's not clear that they scan all drives, especially network ones. Their approach seems targeted towards known file types and using existing document structures for persistence and spread. Therefore, it's less likely that they perform a comprehensive scan of all drives.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that Gamaredon's malware focuses on identifying specific file types, such as Office documents, during the Discovery phase. There is no explicit mention of scanning all drives, including network shared drives. Their tactics seem targeted rather than comprehensive, suggesting they do not scan all drives for sensitive data.

Final Answer: B: No
