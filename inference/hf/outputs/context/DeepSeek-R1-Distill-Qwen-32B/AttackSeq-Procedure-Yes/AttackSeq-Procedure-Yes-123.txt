Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor awaits commands from C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each tactic mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: Agrius uses public-facing application exploits, including FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection. They upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution**: They deploy custom malware like 'IPsec Helper', a .NET backdoor. This backdoor is used for exfiltration, deploying more malware, and executing commands.

3. **Persistence**: They use webshells and register 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.

4. **Defense Evasion**: Webshells are obfuscated with a custom base64 function. The backdoor can update itself and delete traces.

5. **Lateral Movement**: They use webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and harvest credentials with publicly available tools.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**: 'IPsec Helper' communicates over HTTP, using encrypted server addresses. It awaits commands like updating relays, sending recon, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is about whether after 'IPsec Helper' receives commands to send recon or download files, Agrius would deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' for data destruction.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD' being part of the attack sequence. The report details the use of 'IPsec Helper' for execution, persistence, and C2, but doesn't mention these specific wipers or malware. The attack sequence described focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and C2 communication. There's no indication of data destruction activities beyond what's already been described.

The question suggests that 'Apostle' initially failed execution, which implies it's part of their toolkit but perhaps not always successful. However, since the report doesn't mention these tools being used in the attack sequence, it's unclear if they are part of the standard process. The report's focus is on the backdoor and webshells, not on data destruction malware.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there's no evidence that Agrius would deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as part of their activities after the C2 commands. The attack sequence doesn't include these steps, so it's unlikely they would do so.

The CTI report details Agrius' attack sequence, which includes initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control using 'IPsec Helper'. However, it does not mention the deployment of 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD' for data destruction. Since these specific tools aren't part of the described attack sequence, it's unlikely they would be used after the C2 commands.

Final Answer: B
