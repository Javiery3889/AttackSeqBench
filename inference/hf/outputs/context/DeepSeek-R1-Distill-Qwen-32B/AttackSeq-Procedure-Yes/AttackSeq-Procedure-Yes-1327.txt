Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke automatically uploads the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacts live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what it says about the Exfiltration phase.

First, the report mentions the Collection phase where CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It also searches removable drives for files, skipping certain types and drives named 'trandescend.' So, during Collection, it's gathering data through these methods.

Now, looking at the Command and Control section, it says that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware. The configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, which are embedded in the info-stealer and compressed with an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

Wait, so during the Command and Control phase, it uses FTP for exfiltration. But the question is about the Exfiltration phase specifically. The report doesn't have a separate section for Exfiltration, but it's implied that after Collection, the data is sent out. Since the Command and Control part mentions using FTP for exfiltration, that suggests that during Exfiltration, CosmicDuke would use FTP.

Additionally, the report says that the configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials. So, it's likely that CosmicDuke uses stored login credentials to access these FTP servers. It also mentions contacting remote sites, which would be part of the Exfiltration process.

Putting it all together, the report indicates that CosmicDuke does use FTP for exfiltration, uses stored credentials, and contacts remote sites. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The CTI report indicates that CosmicDuke uses FTP for exfiltration, employs stored credentials, and contacts remote sites during the Command and Control phase, which includes Exfiltration. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
