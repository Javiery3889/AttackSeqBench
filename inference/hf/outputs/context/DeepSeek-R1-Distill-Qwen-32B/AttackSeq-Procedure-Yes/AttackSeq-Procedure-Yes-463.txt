Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Bankshot implant communicates with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed via the exploit in the malicious Word document. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the attack starts with Reconnaissance, where Hidden Cobra targets financial organizations. Then, in Resource Development, they set up a malicious domain, falcancoin.io, which is similar to a legitimate cryptocurrency platform but isn't associated with it. The domain was created in 2017 and updated in February 2019, just before the attack.

Next, Initial Access is achieved through spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document called Agreement.docx. This document has an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, specifically CVE-2018-4878. The exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, which in this case is the Bankshot implant.

Looking at the Persistence section, the implant is designed to stay on the victim's network for further attacks. Defense Evasion is also a tactic used, with the implant having the ability to wipe files to cover tracks.

Now, the Command and Control part is crucial. The report states that the implants, which are DLLs, are disguised as ZIP files. These communicate with three control servers, two of which are Chinese-language online gambling sites. The URLs for these servers are hardcoded into the implant's code.

So, putting it all together: the attack uses a spear phishing email with a Word document that exploits a Flash vulnerability to execute the Bankshot implant. Once executed, the implant (which is a DLL) communicates with control servers. The report explicitly mentions that these implants are disguised as ZIP files. Therefore, after the exploit is executed, the implant communicates with the control servers, which are indeed disguised as ZIP files.

The question is asking if it's likely that the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed. Based on the report, the answer should be yes because the implants are described as being disguised as ZIP files and do communicate with the control servers.

The CTI report details that the Bankshot implant, executed via the Flash exploit in the malicious Word document, communicates with control servers disguised as ZIP files. This is confirmed in the Command and Control section, where the implants (DLLs) are described as being disguised as ZIP files and communicate with specific control servers. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
