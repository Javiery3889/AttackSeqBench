Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the encoded PowerShell script retrieved via a VBS macro will execute and download the payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware after initial access through phishing emails. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes a campaign where phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros were used. These macros, when executed, run a VBS script. The VBS script then executes a PowerShell script. 

From the report, under the "Defense Evasion" section, it says that the PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages a DCOM object to execute the downloaded files without saving them. So, the PowerShell script is definitely involved in downloading the payloads.

The "Command and Control" section mentions that the PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers. It first uses the DownloadString method and then the DownloadData method to retrieve resources from two different C2 servers. This indicates that the script is actively reaching out to these servers to get the necessary payloads.

In the "Impact" section, it's clear that the payloads downloaded are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. So, the PowerShell script's role is to fetch these specific payloads and execute them.

Putting this together, the sequence is: phishing email -> Word document with macro -> VBS macro executes -> PowerShell script runs -> communicates with C2 -> downloads Ursnif and GandCrab. 

The question is asking if, after initial access, the PowerShell script will execute and download these payloads. Based on the report, yes, that's exactly what happens. The script does execute and does download the payloads as part of the attack chain.

So, looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." The information in the report supports that the script does execute and download the malware, so the answer should be A.

The CTI report details a campaign where phishing emails with malicious Word documents initiate an attack. The embedded VBS macro executes a PowerShell script, which communicates with C2 servers to download Ursnaf and GandCrab payloads. The report confirms the script's execution and payload retrieval.

Final Answer: A
