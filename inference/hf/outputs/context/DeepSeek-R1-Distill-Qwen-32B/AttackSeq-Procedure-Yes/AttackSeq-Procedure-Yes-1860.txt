Okay, so I need to figure out whether QuasarRAT communicates with a C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels based on the CTI report provided. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the report mentions that QuasarRAT is a backdoor used by the MenuPass threat actor. It uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption. Specifically, the loader uses CppHostCLR to decrypt and load an embedded .NET assembly, which is obfuscated with ConfuserEx. The payload is stored encrypted in the Microsoft.NET directory and decrypted in memory.

Looking at the Defense Evasion section, it says that the loader uses CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx. The payload is encrypted and stored, then decrypted and loaded. The report also mentions that the configuration includes a URL check; if a valid URL is specified, the malware downloads content and connects to the C2 only after that.

Now, the question is about whether QuasarRAT uses AES-128 encryption for C2 communication. The report doesn't explicitly mention AES-128. It talks about encryption in the context of the payload and loader, but not the communication method. The YARA rules mention high-entropy payloads, which could imply encryption, but not specifically AES-128.

The answer choices are Yes or No. Since the report doesn't specify the encryption algorithm used for C2, I can't confirm AES-128. It's possible they use another method or even no encryption, but without explicit info, I shouldn't assume AES-128.

The CTI report details QuasarRAT's use of encryption for payload and loader obfuscation but does not specify the encryption method for C2 communication. While encryption is mentioned, there's no evidence pointing to AES-128. Therefore, it's not confirmed that AES-128 is used.

Final Answer: B: No
