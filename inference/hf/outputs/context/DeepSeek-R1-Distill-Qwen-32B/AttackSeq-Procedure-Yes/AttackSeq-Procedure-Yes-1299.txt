Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack described in the CTI report is likely to use T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) after executing the hidden objects in the Excel document. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand the attack sequence. The report mentions that the attack started with an Initial Access via Spearphishing Attachment (T1193), where an email with an Excel document was sent. When the victim opened the Excel file, it didn't have macros but had a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882, which allowed silent code execution (T1204). So, the execution phase involved dropping a PE file, educrety.exe, which then proceeded to search for credentials.

Next, the report details the Credential Access phase, where the malware used T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry). It also mentions that the data was collected (T1005) and then exfiltrated after encryption (T1002). The Command and Control communication used common ports and standard protocols (T1043 and T1071).

Now, the question is about whether the attack would use T1158 (Hiding Artifacts) before searching for credentials. T1158 involves techniques like creating hidden files or directories to avoid detection. 

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of the attackers hiding files or directories. The report focuses on the execution of the exploit, credential dumping, data collection, and exfiltration. There's no indication that the attackers took steps to hide their artifacts beyond the initial hidden object in the Excel file, which was part of the exploit delivery, not necessarily hiding the subsequent files or processes.

The report does mention that the Excel document had a hidden object, but that's part of the initial execution (T1204) and not about hiding the PE file or other artifacts after execution. The PE file, educrety.exe, was dropped and executed, but there's no evidence it created hidden files or directories beyond that. The focus seems to be on credential access and exfiltration without additional stealth measures beyond the initial exploit.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the attack doesn't appear to employ T1158. The sequence goes from execution to credential access without any mention of hiding artifacts. So, the answer would be that it's not likely they used T1158 in this case.
</think>

The attack sequence described in the CTI report does not include the use of T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories). The report details the execution of a hidden object in the Excel document (T1204) but does not mention any subsequent steps to hide artifacts after the PE file was dropped and executed. The focus is on credential access and data exfiltration without additional stealth measures. 

Final Answer: B: No
