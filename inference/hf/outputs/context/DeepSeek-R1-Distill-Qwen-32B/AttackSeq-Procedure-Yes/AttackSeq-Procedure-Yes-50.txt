Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question based on the provided CTI report. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the CTI report carefully. The report describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with Word documents containing macros. The main goal is to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. 

The attack sequence is broken down into MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, and Impact. 

Reconnaissance: They used phishing emails with Word docs and macros, which are common tactics for initial access. 

Initial Access: The phishing emails had a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc' with VBS macros. These macros were used to execute further code.

Execution: When the document is opened, the VBS macro runs, which then calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script downloads and executes the payloads, which are the two malware types.

Defense Evasion: The PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and a specific DCOM object (C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880) to execute files without saving them.

Impact: The payloads are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. GandCrab encrypts files, and Ursnif does credential harvesting and system info gathering.

Now, the question is: After evading defenses by operating in memory and using that DCOM object, is it likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download the payloads?

The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

Looking at the report, the PowerShell script does download and execute the payloads. It uses the Webclient class to download them, which implies communication with a server. The DCOM object is used to execute without saving to disk, which is part of defense evasion. 

So, the script does communicate with C2 servers to download the payloads. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The PowerShell script in the described attack communicates with servers to download the payloads, indicating that it does interact with C2 servers. 

Final Answer: A
