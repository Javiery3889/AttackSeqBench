Okay, so I need to figure out whether CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 after ChromeLoader tries to bypass macOS security with an animated image. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand what each malware does. The report mentions that ChromeLoader spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG with a shell script to install a Chrome extension. It's noted that ChromeLoader is used for stealing information and serving adware. The report doesn't explicitly say that ChromeLoader uses an animated image to bypass security, but it does mention that it uses a DMG and shell script.

Next, the report says that CloudMensis uses public cloud storage for C2 and exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions. TCC is macOS's Transparency, Consent, and Control framework, which manages user consent for app permissions. So, CloudMensis specifically uses this exploit to bypass TCC.

The question is asking if, after ChromeLoader's attempt to override macOS security (with an animated image), CloudMensis would then exploit CVE-2020-9934 before using cloud storage for C2. 

Wait, but in the report, each malware's techniques are listed separately. ChromeLoader's method is about installing via DMG and shell script, while CloudMensis's method is about exploiting a specific CVE and using cloud storage. The report doesn't indicate that ChromeLoader uses an animated image; that's an assumption in the question. So, the question is positing a scenario where ChromeLoader uses an animated image to bypass security, and then CloudMensis uses the CVE.

But according to the report, CloudMensis's own method is to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for TCC bypass, regardless of what ChromeLoader does. So, if the question is whether CloudMensis would exploit that CVE after ChromeLoader's attempt, the answer would depend on whether CloudMensis's exploit is part of its own process, not necessarily linked to ChromeLoader's actions.

However, the question is phrased as a sequence: after ChromeLoader's attempt, is CloudMensis likely to exploit the CVE before using cloud storage. The report doesn't link these two together. Each malware operates independently. So, CloudMensis's exploit is part of its own attack chain, not necessarily in response to ChromeLoader's actions.

Therefore, the answer would be yes, because CloudMensis does exploit that CVE as part of its own process, regardless of ChromeLoader's method. So, if the scenario is that ChromeLoader does something, then CloudMensis proceeds with its own steps, which include the CVE exploit before C2 via cloud storage.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that CloudMensis independently uses CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions and then employs public cloud storage for C2 communication. The report does not link CloudMensis's actions to ChromeLoader's methods. Therefore, CloudMensis is likely to exploit the CVE as part of its own attack sequence, irrespective of ChromeLoader's activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
