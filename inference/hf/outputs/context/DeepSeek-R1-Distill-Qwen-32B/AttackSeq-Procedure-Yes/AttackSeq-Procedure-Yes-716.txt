Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the Rising Sun implant is part of the Operation Sharpshooter campaign. The attack sequence starts with Reconnaissance, where the implant gathers information like network adapter info, computer name, username, IP address, and OS details from the registry. That's the initial step.

Next, under Execution, the report says that the shellcode from the macro in Word downloads the Rising Sun implant. It also mentions that the implant uses HTTP POST requests to exfiltrate data. So, after the initial execution, the implant communicates via HTTP POST.

Looking at the question, it's asking if after the reconnaissance phase, the implant communicates with specific control servers using HTTP POST. The report doesn't list the exact domains mentioned in the question, but it does say that the implant uses HTTP POST for exfiltration. So, the method of communication (HTTP POST) is confirmed.

The question is about likelihood. Since the report states that the implant uses HTTP POST for command and control, it's reasonable to conclude that yes, it's likely to communicate that way, even if the specific domains aren't mentioned. The method aligns with the report's details.

The Rising Sun implant uses HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, as detailed in the report. While the specific domains aren't mentioned, the method of communication aligns with the report's findings.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
