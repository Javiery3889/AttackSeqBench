Okay, so I need to figure out whether Yellow Garuda exfiltrates the data collected from Telegram accounts over the web and stores it in SQLite and JSON formats. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Yellow Garuda uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool. This tool is used to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. So, the initial part of the question is confirmedâ€”they do collect these types of data.

Next, the report states that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format. That directly answers the question about where the data is stored. So, the data is indeed stored in those formats.

Now, the question is about whether this exfiltration happens over the web. The report doesn't explicitly state that the exfiltration is done over the web, but it does mention that the tool collects the data and stores it in those formats. Since the tool is used to exfiltrate data, it's reasonable to assume that the data is transmitted over the internet to the attacker's servers or storage, which would be done via web-based methods.

Additionally, the report talks about the use of an HTTP GET request for decryption keys, which implies some level of web communication. While that's not directly about exfiltration, it shows that the threat actor uses web-based techniques, supporting the idea that exfiltration would also occur over the web.

Putting it all together, the report confirms that the data is collected and stored in SQLite and JSON. The exfiltration method, while not explicitly stated, is likely over the web given the context of their other web-based activities. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The CTI report confirms that Yellow Garuda uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect specific data and stores it in SQLite and JSON formats. While the report doesn't explicitly mention the use of web-based exfiltration, the context of their activities suggests that data transmission over the web is plausible. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
