Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SHOTPUT backdoor from APT3 communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT from APT18 calls out to their own CnC. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report. It says that APT3 used phishing emails with URLs that led to a malicious Adobe Flash file. This file then downloaded an obfuscated GIF with the SHOTPUT payload. SHOTPUT is a DLL backdoor that communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses. So, SHOTPUT definitely uses hardcoded CnC addresses.

On the other hand, APT18's campaign involved phishing emails that tricked victims into downloading a malicious Adobe Flash update. This delivered a GH0ST RAT variant, which communicated with a known APT18 CnC address, specifically 223.25.233.248. The report mentions that GH0ST RAT called out to this address, which is associated with APT18.

So, the question is asking if SHOTPUT uses hardcoded CnC while GH0ST RAT uses APT18's CnC. From the report, SHOTPUT does use hardcoded CnC addresses, and GH0ST RAT uses APT18's specific CnC. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

I don't see any conflicting information in the report. Both backdoors are described as using their respective CnC addresses as per their groups' tactics. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses, while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, uses APT18's specific CnC address. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
