Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware, after gathering system information, is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The initial access was via SSH, and they used wget to download malware. The execution involved a custom loader that drops the Turbo LKM, which hides processes. Persistence is achieved through Turbo, which hides processes and makes detection harder. Defense evasion includes cloaking, anti-analysis, and kernel-level modifications. Discovery involved gathering system info and sending it via network beacons.

The question is about the specifics of the C2 communication after discovery. The options are whether it's likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscation and specific POST requests.

From the report, the C2 communication is mentioned as "network beacons via destination port 443." Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS, which is encrypted. However, the question is about HTTP beaconing, which is unencrypted. That's a bit conflicting because if they're using port 443, it's more likely HTTPS, but maybe they're using HTTP over 443 for some reason, though that's less common.

The report doesn't specify the type of beaconing or the methods used beyond using port 443. It also mentions that the malware employs cloaking and anti-analysis techniques, which suggests they might use obfuscation to hide their communications. Obfuscation is a common tactic to avoid detection, so that part seems plausible.

The specific part about POST requests to /photos/photo.asp is more detailed. The report doesn't mention any specific URLs or methods used in the beaconing. It just says network beacons. So, without explicit information about the use of such URLs, it's hard to confirm. However, attackers often use legitimate-looking paths to blend in, so /photos/photo.asp could be a way to disguise malicious traffic as benign.

But wait, the question is whether it's "likely" to employ these specific methods. The report doesn't provide evidence of HTTP beaconing or the use of such URLs. It only states that the data is transferred via network beacons on port 443. Since port 443 is usually for HTTPS, using HTTP might be less likely unless they're trying to bypass certain security measures that don't inspect HTTP on that port, which is uncommon.

Moreover, the use of obfuscation is plausible because the malware does employ cloaking and anti-analysis. But the specific URL path isn't mentioned, so it's speculative. The question is about likelihood, so considering the information given, the report doesn't support the specific HTTP POST to /photos/photo.asp. It's possible, but not directly indicated.

So, putting it together: The report says they use port 443 for beacons, which is typically HTTPS. They do use cloaking, so obfuscation is likely. But the specific URL isn't mentioned, making the exact POST request uncertain. Therefore, it's not strongly supported by the report, so the answer might be No.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that the Derusbi malware communicates via network beacons on port 443, typically used for HTTPS. While the malware employs cloaking, suggesting possible obfuscation, the report doesn't specify the use of HTTP beaconing or the specific POST request to /photos/photo.asp. Therefore, it's unlikely to confirm these exact methods based on the given information.

Final Answer: B: No
