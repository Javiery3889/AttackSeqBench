Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to understand the attack sequence and see if this action is likely.

First, the report mentions that the attack started with Reconnaissance, where the threat actors used job recruitment emails to gather information. Then, Initial Access was achieved through malicious documents with macros. The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word, which then retrieved the Rising Sun implant.

Next, during Execution, the shellcode from the macro acted as a downloader. It used functions like LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress to resolve libraries and APIs. It downloaded the second-stage payload (Rising Sun) and a decoy document to the startup folder and %LOCALAPPDATA%, respectively. It executed both payloads using CreateProcessA and ShellExecuteA.

Persistence was ensured by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder, so it would run on each system startup without needing further action.

Command and Control (C2) communication involved the Rising Sun implant using HTTP POST requests, encrypting data with RC4 and obfuscating with Base64. The exfiltration process also used the same encryption and obfuscation methods.

In the "Others" section, it's noted that the Rising Sun implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. It's suggested that the implant might be linked to the Lazarus Group, but there's some uncertainty due to possible false flags.

Now, the question is about whether the implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of discovery before communicating. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, the implant has backdoor capabilities that include gathering drive and process information. Computer name and username are typically part of such information gathering activities. So, it's likely that the implant would collect this information during its initial discovery phase before establishing C2 communication.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The Rising Sun implant, as described in the CTI report, possesses backdoor capabilities that include gathering drive and process information. Computer name and username are standard pieces of information collected during the discovery phase to aid in further attacks or exfiltration. Therefore, it is likely that the implant would fetch this information before communicating with control servers.

Final Answer: A
