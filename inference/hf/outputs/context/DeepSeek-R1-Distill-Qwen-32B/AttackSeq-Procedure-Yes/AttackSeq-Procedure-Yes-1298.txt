Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the cyber attack described in the CTI report is likely to use T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the attack sequence from the report. The initial access was through a spearphishing email with an Excel document. The exploit used was CVE-2017-11882, which allowed silent code execution without user interaction. That's T1204 - User Execution. Then, the dropped PE file, educrety.exe, started credential dumping using T1003, T1081, and T1214. After that, it collected data (T1005), communicated with a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043 and T1071), and exfiltrated data encrypted (T1002).

The question is asking if, after the exploit (T1204) and before credential access, the campaign would use T1107 (File Deletion) for defense evasion. So, the sequence in question is between T1204 and the credential access techniques.

Looking at the report, after the exploit, the PE file is dropped. The report doesn't mention any file deletion happening at that point. The PE file is educrety.exe, which is used for credential dumping. There's no indication that any files were deleted to cover tracks. The report does mention that the Excel document didn't have macros, which is a way to avoid detection, but that's more about the initial delivery, not about deleting files after execution.

T1107 is about deleting files to remove evidence. If the attackers wanted to evade detection, they might delete the malicious Excel file or the PE file after execution. But in this case, the report doesn't state that any files were deleted. The focus seems to be on credential theft and data exfiltration without mentioning any cleanup steps.

Also, the report mentions that the attack used LokiBot, which I know is a banking Trojan. Typically, banking Trojans might use various evasion techniques, but I'm not sure if file deletion is a primary method for LokiBot. More common might be process injection or other methods to stay hidden.

So, based on the information given, there's no evidence that file deletion (T1107) was used. The attack sequence doesn't include any steps that suggest they deleted files to cover their tracks after the exploit and before credential access. Therefore, it's unlikely that T1107 was employed here.

The attack sequence described in the CTI report does not include any mention of file deletion (T1107) after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before credential access. The report focuses on the exploit, credential dumping, data collection, and exfiltration without indicating any cleanup or file deletion steps. Therefore, it is unlikely that T1107 was used.

Final Answer: B: No
