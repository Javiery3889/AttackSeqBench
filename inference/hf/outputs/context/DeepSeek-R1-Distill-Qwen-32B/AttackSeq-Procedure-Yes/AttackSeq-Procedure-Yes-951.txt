Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the prepared file paths were hex-encoded and encrypted before being sent to the C&C server. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the Sednit group used a spearphishing campaign with shortened URLs leading to a payload. The payload included an executable and a decoy PDF. When the executable ran, it prompted for a password and opened the decoy, while a downloader ran in the background.

In the Execution phase, the operators used a Stage-1 downloader to download another downloader, which then installed a Delphi backdoor. The backdoor's configuration was split into four hex-encoded, encrypted blobs. So, encryption and hex-encoding were used here for the configuration.

Looking at the Defense Evasion section, the malware deleted files and killed processes to avoid detection. That suggests they were careful about leaving traces, which might imply they also encrypted data during exfiltration.

In the Collection phase, the malware scanned for specific file extensions, staged data by creating a file with paths, and had features for input and screen capture. The Command and Control section says that data sent were hex-encoded and encrypted with AES or a custom algorithm. There was also a fallback C&C server.

So, the question is about whether the file paths were hex-encoded and encrypted before sending. The report explicitly states that data sent to the C&C were hex-encoded and encrypted. Since the collection phase involved staging data with file paths, it's logical that these paths were part of the data sent, thus encrypted and encoded.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The CTI report indicates that data sent to the C&C server were hex-encoded and encrypted using AES or a custom algorithm. Since the collection phase involved staging file paths for exfiltration, these paths would have been included in the data sent, thus encrypted and encoded.

Final Answer: A
