Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in the CCleaner attack would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes a supply chain attack where the CCleaner software was modified to include a malicious payload. The attack involved a multi-stage malware, which means it had multiple phases of execution. The initial access was through the compromised download servers of Avast, which distributed the malicious version of CCleaner.

In the execution phase, the report mentions that the malicious binary modified the CCleaner to execute malicious code before normal operations. It decrypted two stages: a PIC PE loader and a DLL file. The malware attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature. The binary created an executable heap, copied the decrypted malware into it, and then called the PE loader. After that, it erased the memory regions and continued with normal operations.

The defense evasion tactics included modifying the DLL to avoid detection and using a valid certificate. The DLL, CBkdr.dll, had an entry point that created a thread to return control to the loader. This thread was responsible for calling a function named CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall, which suggests that it's reaching out to a C2 server to get shellcode.

Now, the question is about whether the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information via HTTPS POST requests. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, the function CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall implies that the malware communicates with a C2 server to retrieve shellcode. This suggests that the malware does establish a C2 channel. The use of HTTPS POST requests isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's a common method for C2 communication because it's encrypted and can blend in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect.

Additionally, the report mentions that the malware attempted to evade detection, which often includes using encryption and encoding to hide the data being sent. So, it's plausible that the C2 communication uses encrypted and encoded data.

Therefore, putting it all together, the malware likely does establish a C2 channel using such methods.

The malware in the CCleaner attack establishes a C2 channel as indicated by the function CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall, which retrieves shellcode from a C2 server. Given the use of HTTPS and common evasion tactics, it's likely encrypted and encoded data is used.

Final Answer: A: Yes
