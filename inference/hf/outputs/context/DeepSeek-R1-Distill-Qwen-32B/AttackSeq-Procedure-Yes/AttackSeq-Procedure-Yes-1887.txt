Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after they've gained credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, before using WMI for lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of FIN13. Let's go through each section relevant to the question.

Reconnaissance: The report mentions that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials. This suggests they do some level of internal reconnaissance to understand the network structure and identify high-value targets.

Initial Access: They use web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. This is about how they get into the network, but not directly related to the question.

Execution: They use JSPRAT for command execution and file transfer. They also use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor. This shows they have tools for executing commands, which could include using native OS tools.

Persistence: They replace legitimate binaries like KeePass with trojanized versions. They also use email for C2 with MAILSLOT. This indicates they use both custom and legitimate tools for persistence.

Privilege Escalation: They use ProcDump to dump LSASS memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil for obfuscation. This is directly related because the question mentions memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing for credentials.

Defense Evasion: They use passive backdoors and legitimate utilities like certutil. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon features. This shows they employ a mix of custom and native tools to avoid detection.

Credential Access: They use process memory dumping (like LSASS) and network sniffing. They also target unsecured credentials and use trojanized KeePass. So, they have multiple methods to gather credentials.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI for remote command execution and have custom web shells. They also use Invoke-WMIExec and Invoke-SMBExec. This is the part where they move laterally after gaining access.

Collection: They collect data from network shares and archive it. They target specific data for fraudulent transactions.

Command and Control: They use various C2 methods, including proxies and encoding data. They transfer tools into the environment, which might include native binaries.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data using web services and tools like web shells. This is about moving data out, not directly about internal reconnaissance.

Now, the question is about whether, after gaining credentials via LSASS dumping and network sniffing, FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance before using WMI for lateral movement.

From the report, I know that FIN13 uses tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz, which are legitimate utilities. They also use certutil for obfuscation. These are all native OS tools. Additionally, they use WMI for lateral movement, which is a native OS feature.

So, after gaining credentials, it's logical that they would perform internal reconnaissance. This would involve using native tools to gather information on user accounts, such as querying Active Directory, listing users, or checking permissions. This step is crucial before moving laterally to ensure they have the right access and to map the network further.

The report doesn't explicitly state that they use native OS binaries for reconnaissance, but given their use of other native tools and the fact that they are sophisticated, it's plausible they would do so. Using native tools helps them blend in and avoid detection, which aligns with their defense evasion tactics mentioned in the report.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

After gaining credentials through LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing, FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance before employing WMI for lateral movement. This aligns with their known tactics of using legitimate utilities to avoid detection and effectively map the network.

Final Answer: A
