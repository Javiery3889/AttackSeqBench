Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw after it uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the Taidoor malware campaign, which starts with a spear-phishing email. The email has an attachment that, when opened, exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to install the malware. There's also a decoy document to avoid suspicion.

The report mentions that the malware communicates with a CnC server using HTTP GET requests with an encrypted MAC address. Then, in the Defense Evasion section, it says that the new variant uses a downloader that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, decrypts it into a modified Taidoor, and changes its network traffic to avoid detection.

In the "Others" section, it notes that Taidoor has been active since 2008 and has changed tactics in 2011 and 2012. It also mentions another malware family, Taleret, which uses similar CnC techniques and is associated with Taiwan. The CnC naming schemes between Taidoor and Taleret are similar.

Now, the question is about whether the new variant will communicate with the specific CnC servers mentioned: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to determine if these servers are likely to be used by the new variant. From the report, the new variant uses a downloader that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs, which suggests a change in how it communicates. The original Taidoor used a consistent HTTP GET pattern with an encrypted MAC address. The new variant has changed its network traffic to avoid detection, implying that it might be using different CnC servers or different communication methods.

Additionally, the report mentions that Taidoor and Taleret have similar CnC naming schemes. The servers mentioned in the question, roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw, seem to fit a pattern that could be associated with these malware families. However, the report doesn't explicitly state that these specific servers are used by Taidoor. It does say that the new variant has changed its network traffic, which might mean it's using different servers to avoid detection.

Moreover, the fact that Taidoor has undergone significant changes in 2011 and 2012 suggests that the CnC infrastructure might have been updated or changed as part of these evolutions. Therefore, the new variant might not be using the same CnC servers as before, or it might be using new ones that aren't mentioned in the report.

Given that the report doesn't explicitly list these servers as being used by Taidoor, and considering that the new variant has altered its communication methods, it's less likely that it would use these specific servers. Instead, it might be using different ones to stay under the radar.

So, putting it all together, the answer is probably No because the new variant has changed its network traffic and likely uses different CnC servers to avoid detection, and the specific servers mentioned aren't confirmed in the report.
</think>

The new Taidoor variant has altered its network communication methods to avoid detection, suggesting a change in CnC servers. The report doesn't explicitly mention the servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw, and given the variant's evasion tactics, it's unlikely to use these specific servers.

Final Answer: B: No
