Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malware in question saves screen recording files in the format [%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi during the data collection phase. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what information is relevant.

First, the report mentions that the malware collects basic information like IP address, hostname, username, OS version, and searches for Bitcoin wallet addresses in a specific registry key. It then uploads this information to Dropbox with a log file named in the format %Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S.log. 

I'm looking for any mention of screen recording or video files. The report doesn't explicitly state that the malware captures screen recordings. It talks about collecting system info and Bitcoin addresses, then uploading logs. The log files are text-based, not video files. 

The malware uses Dropbox for C&C activities, uploading and downloading files. The files mentioned include bin.asc, which is a payload, and log files. There's no indication of video files being part of this process. 

The question is about whether screen recording files are saved in a specific format. Since the report doesn't mention any screen recording functionality or any video files being created or uploaded, it's unlikely that the malware does this. 

Therefore, the answer is probably no.

The CTI report details the malware's activities, which include collecting system information and Bitcoin wallet addresses, then uploading this data as log files to Dropbox. There is no mention of screen recording or video file creation.
