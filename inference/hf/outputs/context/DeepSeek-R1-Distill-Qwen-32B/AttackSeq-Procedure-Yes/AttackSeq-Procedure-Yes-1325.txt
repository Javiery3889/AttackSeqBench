Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke uses a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives and before exfiltrating data via FTP. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The initial access is through a PDF exploit or a disguised executable. Then execution uses a loader similar to MiniDuke. Persistence is achieved through scheduled tasks and a Windows service. 

Next, the credential access section says CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, etc., and also steals Windows credentials like hashes and private keys. It also exports certificates with a specific password. 

In the discovery phase, it searches for files on hard drives and network drives, looking for specific patterns and non-English filenames, particularly those with 'sifr' and 'sifer'. It doesn't mention anything about searching removable drives or skipping certain file types, but the question says it does, so I have to consider that as part of the scenario.

The command and control section mentions communication via HTTP GET, FTP, and WebDav for exfiltration. The exfiltration part details that data is uploaded via FTP, including login credentials and folder structures.

Now, the question is about whether CosmicDuke uses a clipboard stealer after the discovery phase. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of clipboard stealing. The credential access part talks about stealing from various applications and Windows credentials, but not the clipboard. Clipboard stealing would fall under a different TTP, perhaps under credential access or data collection.

Since the report doesn't mention clipboard stealing, it's unlikely that CosmicDuke uses this method. The exfiltration is done via FTP, but that's after collecting data, which in this case doesn't include clipboard data as per the report.

So, the answer is probably No.

The CTI report does not mention CosmicDuke using a clipboard stealer. It focuses on stealing credentials from specific software and Windows, but not clipboard data. Therefore, it's unlikely that CosmicDuke uses a clipboard stealer.

Final Answer: B: No
