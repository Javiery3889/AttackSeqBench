Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) is likely to be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and then deleted by the Derusbi malware after the initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI report, the initial access involved SSH access and using wget to download malware. The malware was fetched from an IP address, and the binary had a date string matching the download day, suggesting it's freshly compiled. So, the initial step is clear: they got in via SSH and downloaded the malware.

Next, the report mentions that the Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes. It does this by modifying the system's global call table, specifically PIDs, allowing processes to hide. Also, it disables CR0 write protection to modify the system call table. This indicates that the LKM is loaded into the kernel to achieve persistence and evasion.

The question is about whether the Turbo LKM is dropped to disk, loaded, and then deleted. So, I need to see if the report supports this sequence.

From the report, the malware is downloaded, which implies it's written to disk. Then, the Turbo LKM is used for persistence, which suggests it's loaded into the kernel. Now, does the report say anything about the LKM being deleted after loading?

The report doesn't explicitly mention the deletion of the LKM. It talks about the LKM's functionality but doesn't state whether it's deleted post-loading. However, considering that the LKM is part of the persistence mechanism, it's more likely that it remains in the kernel to maintain persistence rather than being deleted. If it were deleted, the persistence might be lost, which doesn't make sense for an attacker aiming to maintain access.

Additionally, the report mentions that the LKM is used to hide processes, which is a defense evasion technique. If the LKM were deleted, it wouldn't be able to continue hiding processes, which would defeat the purpose of using it for persistence and evasion.

So, putting it together: the LKM is dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and remains there to provide persistence. There's no indication that it's deleted afterward. Therefore, the answer is likely "No," it's not deleted.

The Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) is dropped to disk and loaded into the kernel to provide persistence and hide processes. The report does not mention the LKM being deleted after loading, and its continued presence is necessary for maintaining persistence and evasion. Therefore, it is unlikely that the LKM is deleted.

Final Answer: B: No
