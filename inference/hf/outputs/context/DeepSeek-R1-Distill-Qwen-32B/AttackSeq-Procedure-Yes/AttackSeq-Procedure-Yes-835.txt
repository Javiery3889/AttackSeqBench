Okay, so I need to figure out whether WinDealer steals information from SNS applications and encrypts it using AES before communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, looking at the Execution section: WinDealer executes by reading its config from C:\ProgramData and loads a DLL. It steals info from the PC, including network config and SNS apps, saving data as .a files in %TEMP%. Then it sends this to the C2 server.

Defense Evasion: It uses XOR to encode config files. Communicates with C2 using encrypted channels, encrypting an AES key with RSA. Also, encrypts stolen info with AES128 ECB before sending.

Discovery: It discovers PC info, network config, and SNS data. Processes and stages data in %TEMP%, encrypts with AES before sending.

Collection: Collects data from USB, docs, desktop, recycle bin, and SNS folders. Data is processed into .a files and categorized.

Exfiltration: Data is exfiltrated from %TEMP% as .a files.

Others: The group targets Korean and Japanese orgs since 2014. WinDealer uses a hardcoded RSA1024 public key. Communication includes sending encrypted AES key and receiving commands. DLL module has functions for stealing data, setting config, and initiating commands. Monitors USB, SNS folders, saves items in separate files for C2.

Now, the question is about whether WinDealer steals SNS info, encrypts with AES, and uses non-standard ports.

From the report, under Execution, it says it steals info from SNS apps. Under Defense Evasion, it encrypts stolen data with AES128 before transmission. So that part checks out.

But the question also mentions communication using non-standard ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556. The report doesn't specify the ports used. It only mentions encrypted communication channels, using AES and RSA, but no details on ports. So I don't have info on whether they use non-standard ports.

Wait, the Others section says the malware communicates with C2 servers, sending an encrypted AES key and receiving commands. But no mention of specific ports. So the report doesn't provide info on ports used.

Therefore, while the first two parts (stealing SNS data and AES encryption) are confirmed, the part about non-standard ports isn't addressed. So the answer would be that it's likely for the first two, but since the ports aren't mentioned, the question's assertion about using those specific ports can't be confirmed from the report.

Wait, but the question is whether it's likely that WinDealer will do all three: steal SNS info, encrypt with AES, and use non-standard ports. Since the report doesn't mention the ports, we can't confirm that part. So the answer would be No, because the report doesn't support the use of those specific ports.

Alternatively, maybe the ports are standard for this group, but the report doesn't say. So without evidence, we can't assume. Therefore, the answer is No because the ports aren't mentioned, making the entire sequence not fully supported by the report.
</think>

The CTI report confirms that WinDealer steals information from SNS applications and encrypts the data using AES before transmission. However, the report does not provide any information regarding the use of non-standard ports such as UDP 6999 or TCP 55556 for communication with C2 servers. Since the ports are not mentioned, we cannot confirm that part of the sequence. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
