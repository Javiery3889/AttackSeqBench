Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether HIDDEN COBRA is likely to use legitimate sites hijacked and repurposed as part of their global exfiltration network. The question is asking if, after intercepting data with malicious scripts, they use such sites to host exfiltration nodes. The answer choices are Yes or No.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. It mentions that HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactions. The skimmer captures customer data and sends it to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server. The "Others" section notes that Sansec linked the activity to HIDDEN COBRA through reused infrastructure and malware patterns. It also says that the skimming has been ongoing since May 2019, with multiple links to previous North Korean operations.

Now, the question is about whether they use legitimate sites as exfiltration nodes. The answer choices are Yes or No. I need to determine if the report suggests that HIDDEN COBRA uses such sites.

From the report, it's clear that the attackers inject scripts into checkout pages to intercept data. The data is then sent to a collection server controlled by HIDDEN COBRA. The report doesn't explicitly mention whether these collection servers are hosted on legitimate hijacked sites or if they're using their own infrastructure.

However, I know from general knowledge about APT groups like Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA that they often use compromised legitimate sites to host their command and control (C2) servers. This is a common tactic to avoid detection and to make their infrastructure appear benign. They might compromise websites of various entities, like the ones mentioned in the question (Italian modeling agency, vintage music store, etc.), to use as exfiltration nodes.

The report doesn't provide direct evidence, but the fact that they're using a skimmer to collect data and send it to their servers suggests that they have some form of C2 infrastructure. It's plausible that they would use hijacked legitimate sites for this purpose, as it's a known tactic in their modus operandi.

So, putting it together, while the report doesn't explicitly state it, the context and typical behavior of HIDDEN COBRA support the idea that they would use such hijacked sites for exfiltration.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that HIDDEN COBRA uses malicious scripts to intercept transaction data and sends it to their controlled servers. While the report doesn't explicitly mention the use of hijacked legitimate sites, it's common for such APT groups to employ compromised sites for C2 infrastructure to avoid detection. Therefore, it's plausible that HIDDEN COBRA uses these sites for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
