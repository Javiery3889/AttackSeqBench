Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Emissary Trojan authors are likely to update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes. Let me start by breaking down the information from the CTI report and the question.

First, the report mentions that the Emissary Trojan has been in use since 2009 and has evolved over time. It's related to the Elise Trojan and part of Operation Lotus Blossom. The report notes that after a specific report in 2015, there was a significant increase in development, leading to many new versions. This suggests that the threat actors are actively updating their malware to adapt and improve.

Looking at the attack sequence, the report details how Emissary achieves persistence. It writes itself to a specific DLL file and creates registry keys for configuration and a unique GUID. It also hijacks legitimate services. The question is about whether they would recompile the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes to evade detection.

I know that PE header hashes are used by antivirus and detection systems to identify malicious files. If the authors recompile the code without changing the PE headers, the hashes would remain the same, which might not help in evading detection because security systems would still recognize the file as malicious based on the unchanged hash. However, if they change the PE headers, it would create a new hash, making it harder for detection systems to catch the updated version.

But the question is about whether they would do this. The report indicates that the authors have been updating the Trojan regularly, which implies they are likely to use various evasion techniques. Recompiling without changing the PE headers might not be effective, so they might instead change the headers to avoid detection. Alternatively, they might use other methods like code obfuscation or packing to change the file's signature without altering the headers.

Wait, but the question specifically asks if they will update by recompiling without changing the PE header hashes. If they don't change the headers, the hashes stay the same, so detection systems that rely on those hashes would still flag the file. Therefore, it's unlikely they would do that because it wouldn't help in evading detection. Instead, they would probably change the headers or use other methods to alter the file's signature.

So, considering their active development and the need to evade detection, it's more plausible that they would change the PE headers or use other techniques rather than keeping the same hashes. Therefore, the answer would be that it's unlikely they would update without changing the PE headers, meaning the answer is B: No.
</think>

The Emissary Trojan's authors have demonstrated a history of updating their malware to evade detection, including significant changes after 2015. They are likely to employ methods that alter file signatures, such as changing PE headers or using obfuscation, rather than recompiling without changing the hashes, which wouldn't help in evading detection.

Final Answer: B: No
