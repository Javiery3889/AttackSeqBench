Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Collection phase, Gamaredon's malware searches for sensitive documents on the local system and scans all drives, including removable drives and network shares. They also have a backdoor that takes screenshots every minute and deploy scripts that automatically scan for interesting documents. So, they're definitely collecting data, but the question is about exfiltration.

Looking at the Command and Control section, it says their malware uses both HTTP and HTTPS for C&C. That suggests they have the capability to communicate with their servers, which is necessary for exfiltration. But does the report explicitly state that they automatically upload the collected documents?

In the Collection phase, it's mentioned that the backdoor lists interesting files for future exfiltration. The word "future" implies that the exfiltration might happen later, but it doesn't specify if it's automatic or manual. The report also talks about persistence techniques and lateral movement, but not the exact method of exfiltration.

The "Others" section mentions that the group's strategy includes installing multiple scripts and executables, which complicates defenders' efforts. It also notes that they don't seem to make efforts to stay under the radar, focusing on spreading quickly and exfiltrating data. This suggests they might be aggressive in their data theft, possibly automating the process to move quickly.

However, the report doesn't explicitly state that the modules automatically upload the documents. It only says they search for and collect them, and have the C&C communication set up. Without explicit mention of automatic upload, I can't be certain. Maybe they collect the data and then exfiltrate it manually or through another method not detailed here.

So, considering the information, while it's likely they exfiltrate, the report doesn't confirm whether it's automatic. Therefore, the answer might be that it's not certain, but given their aggressive tactics, it's probable. However, since the question is about likelihood based on the report, and the report doesn't specify automatic upload, I might lean towards 'No' because it's not explicitly stated.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that Gamaredon's malware collects sensitive documents and has the capability to communicate with C&C servers. However, it does not explicitly state that the modules automatically upload the harvested documents. While their aggressive tactics suggest possible automation, the lack of explicit information leans towards uncertainty. 

Final Answer: B: No
