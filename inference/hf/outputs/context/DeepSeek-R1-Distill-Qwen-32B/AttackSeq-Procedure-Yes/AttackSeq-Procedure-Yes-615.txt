Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the VBS script in the Gamaredon APT attack is likely to communicate with a specific C&C server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The initial access was through targeted emails with malicious documents, using COVID-19 as a lure. The document used a template injection technique to load a malicious macro. 

When the victim opens the document, the macro executes a VBScript called PlayList.vbs. This script is dropped into a specific directory and then executed using wscript.exe. The script then creates a RUN key in the registry for persistence, ensuring it runs on every startup. 

For defense evasion, the script uses obfuscation and deletes itself after execution. The 'Others' section mentions that the group uses rented VPSes, but it doesn't explicitly state anything about communication with a C&C server.

Now, the question is asking if the VBS script will communicate with a specific C&C server URL. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to consider what the VBS script does. The report says it's obfuscated and deletes itself, which are defense evasion tactics. But does it mention anything about communication with a C&C server? The report doesn't explicitly state that the script communicates with a C&C. It only talks about execution, persistence, and evasion.

In many APT attacks, after initial execution and persistence, the next step is typically establishing communication with a C&C server to receive commands or exfiltrate data. However, the report doesn't provide details about this step. It stops at the script deleting itself after execution.

So, without explicit information that the script communicates with a C&C, I can't assume it does. The report focuses on the initial stages up to persistence and evasion, but doesn't mention command and control activities. Therefore, it's not likely that the script communicates with the specified C&C server based on the given information.

The CTI report details the initial attack stages, including the use of a VBS script for execution, persistence, and evasion. However, it does not mention communication with a C&C server. Since there's no evidence of such activity, it's unlikely the script communicates with the specified server.

Final Answer: B: No
