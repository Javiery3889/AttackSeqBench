Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the adversary in the CTI report is likely to move laterally to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM after using PsLogList for account discovery and executing Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand the attack sequence. The report mentions several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques used by the adversary. 

Starting with Initial Access, the adversary uses credential stuffing or password spraying to gain access to remote services. Once they have a valid account, they access the network through services like VPN or Citrix. 

In the Execution phase, they install Cobalt Strike using a PowerShell one-liner, specifically versions 3.8, 3.12, and 3.14. They use scheduled tasks to execute batch files. 

For Persistence, they load the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms, relying on high-uptime systems like servers. They also look for VPN and firewall configs as backup access.

In Privilege Escalation, they perform password spraying against domain admin accounts and use tools like NtdsAudit and msadcs.exe to dump password hashes. They also move laterally to systems where a domain admin is logged in.

Defense Evasion involves cleaning up traces, clearing event logs, deleting files, and using timestomping with a tool from UnxUtils.

Credential Access is achieved through brute force, specifically credential stuffing or password spraying, with login attempts from a small set of IPs.

Lateral Movement is done using Cobalt Strike's built-in methods, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM. The adversary aims to move to a domain controller as soon as possible.

Collection involves gathering data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, local systems, network shares, and email accounts.

Command and Control uses Cobalt Strike with C2 over DNS and HTTPS, using a patched trial version that doesn't support encrypted traffic in some cases.

Exfiltration uses Cobalt Strike for small data and a custom tool for large data, sending it to cloud storage like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.

Now, the question is about whether the adversary will move laterally to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM after using PsLogList for account discovery and Mimikatz to dump credentials.

Looking at the report, under Lateral Movement, it explicitly states that the adversary uses SMB, PsExec, and WinRM as part of Cobalt Strike's built-in methods. They also aim to move to a domain controller as soon as possible. 

PsLogList is a tool used for viewing security logs, which would help in account discovery. Mimikatz is used for credential dumping, which is part of their Privilege Escalation phase. Once they have the credentials, they can use them to move laterally.

So, the sequence makes sense: after gaining initial access, executing Cobalt Strike, escalating privileges by dumping credentials, they would then use those credentials with tools like PsExec or WinRM to move laterally to a domain controller. The report supports that they do use these methods for lateral movement.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, it's likely.

The adversary's attack sequence involves using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement via SMB, PsExec, or WinRM after credential dumping, aligning with the report's details.
