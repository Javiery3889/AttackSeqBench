Okay, so I need to figure out whether the KONNI malware is likely to upload stolen data like keystrokes and screenshots to its C2 infrastructure. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, looking at the report, the malware communicates with C2 using HTTP connections. The C2 is hosted by 000webhost, and the samples connected to a URI like <c2-domain>/login.php. Over time, more .php files became available for registration, uploading, and downloading files. That suggests that the C2 has functionalities for handling file uploads and downloads.

The report also mentions that the malware is designed to steal files, keystrokes, and perform screenshots. So, it's clear that the malware has the capability to collect this data. Now, the question is whether it will exfiltrate this data to the C2.

In the Command and Control section, it says the C2 infrastructure allows for registration, uploading, and downloading files. That implies that the malware can send data to the C2. Since the malware's purpose includes collection of keystrokes and screenshots, it makes sense that it would upload this data to the C2 for exfiltration.

Additionally, the report notes that the malware's capabilities have evolved, including the addition of remote administration features. This further supports the idea that the malware is designed to send data back to the attackers.

So, putting it all together, the malware has the means (C2 with upload functionality) and the motive (stealing data) to upload the stolen information. Therefore, it's highly likely that it does so as part of its exfiltration process.

The KONNI malware communicates with its C2 infrastructure via HTTP, using functionalities for uploading files. It is designed to steal keystrokes and screenshots, indicating it collects such data. The C2's ability to handle uploads supports the exfiltration of this information. Therefore, it is likely that the malware uploads stolen data to the C2.

Final Answer: A: Yes
