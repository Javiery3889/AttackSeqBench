Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Darkhotel APT maintains persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware after deploying their malware components. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Execution phase, Darkhotel deploys various malware components like downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers. It also uses 0-day exploits for Adobe and IE. Then, in the Defense Evasion section, they use digital certificates to sign their backdoors and encrypt data with RC4-like algorithms.

The question is about persistence. The answer choices are Yes or No. The options are whether they use autorun registry settings and malware for persistence.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of autorun registry settings or specific persistence mechanisms beyond the initial execution. They do talk about maintaining a dynamic infrastructure and using encrypted data storage, but not about how they keep the malware running after initial execution.

Autorun registry settings are a common persistence method, but the report doesn't explicitly state that Darkhotel uses them. They might use other methods not detailed here, but without explicit info, I can't assume they do. So, the answer is likely No.
</think>

The Darkhotel APT's CTI report details their use of malware components and evasion techniques but does not mention the use of autorun registry settings for persistence. Therefore, it is unlikely they use this method.

Final Answer: B: No
