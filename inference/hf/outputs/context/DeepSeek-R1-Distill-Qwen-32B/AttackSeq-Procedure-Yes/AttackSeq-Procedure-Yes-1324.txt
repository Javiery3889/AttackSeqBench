Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating data via FTP. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that CosmicDuke is involved in credential access. It specifically lists software it targets, like Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, and various browsers and email clients. It steals Windows credentials, including hashes, cached passwords, LSA secrets, and WLAN keys. It also exports certificates with a specific password. But I don't see any mention of keylogging, taking screenshots, or stealing clipboard data.

The report's Execution section talks about how the malware is loaded, but nothing about data collection methods beyond credential theft. The Discovery section says it searches for files on hard drives and network drives, looking for specific patterns and non-English filenames, but again, no mention of keyloggers or screenshotters.

The Exfiltration part details how data is sent via FTP, but the data collected is the information gathered from credential access and file searches, not from keylogging or clipboard activities. The report doesn't mention any tools or methods beyond what's already listed for credential access.

So, based on the information provided, there's no evidence that CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It focuses on stealing credentials from specific applications and system data, not on real-time data capture methods like keylogging or screenshotting.

The CTI report does not mention CosmicDuke using keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It focuses on credential theft from specific applications and system data, not real-time data capture methods.

Final Answer: B: No
