Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique corresponds to the malware gathering system information like network configurations and active TCP connections after using Enigma Protector for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes an attack where the initial access was through a watering-hole attack on the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website. The attackers compromised the site to deliver malicious JavaScript files, which then led to malware downloads. The malware, gpsvc.exe, is packed with Enigma Protector, which is a commercial packer used for defense evasion. 

The report mentions that the malware executes a series of basic system information gathering commands and sends the results back to the C&C server, eye-watch.in. The question is specifically about the technique used when the malware gathered detailed system information, such as network configurations and active TCP connections.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
B: T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery
C: T1580 - Cloud Infrastructure Discovery
D: T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries

I need to match the described activity to the correct ATT&CK technique. 

T1190 is about exploiting public-facing applications, which doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about information gathering, not exploiting. 

T1049 is System Network Connections Discovery, which involves actions taken by an adversary to gather information about network connections. This seems relevant because the malware is gathering network configurations and active TCP connections.

T1580 is about discovering cloud infrastructure, which isn't mentioned in the report. The attack targets financial institutions, not cloud services, so this is probably not the right choice.

T1547.013 relates to using XDG autostart entries for persistence, which isn't what's described here. The report talks about gathering information, not establishing persistence.

So, the most plausible answer is B: T1049, as it directly relates to the collection of network information by the malware.
</think>

The malware gathered system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections, which aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1049, System Network Connections Discovery. This technique involves actions taken by adversaries to collect information about network connections, which matches the described activity.

Final Answer: B
