Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Kingslayer backdoor and the MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Let me start by breaking down the information given in the CTI report and the question.

First, the report mentions that the Kingslayer backdoor used a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm, which means it only communicated during certain times of the day and specific days. It was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised between April 2015. The backdoor's beaconing pattern was designed to evade detection, so that's under Defense Evasion.

The Command and Control section says that the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net was sinkholed, and both Kingslayer and K2 malware used this domain. K2 had a different beaconing pattern, every ten minutes without a sleep period. 

In the Others section, it's noted that the campaign was linked to Codoso and Shell_Crew, targeting sysadmins of large enterprises. The backdoor was undetected by antivirus but found by RSA NetWitness because of its floating code. There's also a Yara signature provided.

Now, the question is asking: Before Kingslayer used the diurnal beaconing for Defense Evasion with a stolen code signing key, which ATT&CK technique facilitated its deployment via software subversion?

The answer choices are A: T1195.003 (Compromise Hardware Supply Chain), B: T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise), C: T1021.005 (VNC), D: T1219 (Remote Access Software).

I need to figure out which technique was used to deploy the backdoor into enterprise environments. The key here is "sophisticated software subversion." The report mentions that the backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing key from Alpha's software packaging system. That suggests that the attackers compromised a legitimate software supply chain to distribute their malware.

Looking at the answer choices, T1195 is Supply Chain Compromise, which involves compromising a software supply chain to distribute malware. T1195.003 is a specific sub-technique under that, which is Compromise Hardware Supply Chain. But the report talks about a software packaging system, not hardware. So T1195.003 might not be the right one because it's about hardware.

T1021.005 is about VNC, which is a remote desktop tool, but the question is about deployment via software subversion, not remote access. T1219 is about using legitimate remote access software, which again seems more about how they access systems rather than how the malware was deployed.

So the main technique here is Supply Chain Compromise (T1195), where the attackers compromised the software packaging system to sign their backdoor, making it look legitimate. This would allow the backdoor to be deployed into enterprise environments as part of the software update or distribution process.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.
</think>

The Kingslayer backdoor was deployed using a stolen code signing key from a software packaging system, indicating a compromise of the software supply chain. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1195, which involves compromising a software supply chain to distribute malware. The other options either pertain to hardware supply chain, remote access tools, or VNC, which are not relevant here.

Final Answer: B
