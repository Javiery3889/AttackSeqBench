Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique the OceanLotus Group used after harvesting credentials and before using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the OceanLotus Group used Mimikatz to obtain credentials, including user passwords, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets. They customized and obfuscated Mimikatz payloads to evade detection. Then, they used the stolen credentials to perform lateral movement and infect more machines. 

The question is asking what technique they used between harvesting credentials and using Windows tools and pass-the-hash. So, after getting the credentials, they needed a way to move laterally. 

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1546.008 - Accessibility Features. I'm not too familiar with this one, but I think it's about using accessibility tools which might not fit here.

B: T1070 - Indicator Removal. That's about removing logs or other indicators, which doesn't seem to fit the lateral movement phase.

C: T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material. This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate, like using stolen credentials or tokens. Since they used Mimikatz to get credentials, this seems relevant.

D: T1563.001 - SSH Hijacking. That's more about taking over SSH sessions, which doesn't seem to be mentioned in the report.

So, the group used Mimikatz to get credentials, which are then used for lateral movement. Using these credentials would fall under T1550, using alternate authentication material. They didn't use SSH, so D is out. They didn't remove indicators at this point, so B is out. A doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the answer should be C.

The OceanLotus Group utilized Mimikatz to harvest credentials, which they then used for lateral movement. This process aligns with T1550, as they employed alternate authentication material (stolen credentials) to expand within the network before using Windows tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

Final Answer: C
