Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique Shuckworm used to ensure their backdoor remains active after system reboots. Let's break down the information from the CTI report.

First, the report mentions that Shuckworm used malicious documents to execute the Pterodo backdoor. Then, they created scheduled tasks to maintain their presence. Scheduled tasks are a common method for persistence because they can execute scripts or commands at specified times, even after a system reboot.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution. This technique involves modifying boot processes or logon scripts to execute malicious code. It's a way to ensure persistence across reboots.

B: T1098-Account Manipulation. This is about creating or modifying user accounts, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining persistence after a reboot.

C: T1024.003-Malicious Image. This involves using image files to execute code, which isn't mentioned in the report.

D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter. This is about using built-in command-line tools, which Shuckworm did use, but it's more about execution rather than persistence.

The report specifically mentions that Shuckworm created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence. Scheduled tasks fall under T1547 because they execute at system startup or user logon, ensuring the backdoor remains active. So, the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that Shuckworm used scheduled tasks to maintain persistence, which aligns with the T1547 technique. This technique ensures that malicious activities continue after system reboots by executing tasks at startup or logon.

Final Answer: A
