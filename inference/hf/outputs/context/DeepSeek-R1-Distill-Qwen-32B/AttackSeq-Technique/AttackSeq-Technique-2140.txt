Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question based on the provided CTI report and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the CTI report carefully. It mentions that on November 27, 2020, a Twitter user reported a malware hash associated with AridViper. The malware was delivered via a malicious document that looked like a Curriculum Vitae, likely part of a phishing campaign. Once executed, the malware made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson.info. 

In the "Others" section, it says that passive DNS data showed most domains were associated with NameCheap in the US, except one which was in Japan. It also notes that NameCheap infrastructure has been used before by AridViper.

Now, the question is asking about the technique used before additional C2 domains were identified. The question specifically mentions that these additional domains were found through pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings. So, the focus is on the initial communication with the first C2 domain, judystevenson.info.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1001.001 - Junk Data
B: T1595.001 - Scanning IP Blocks
C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol
D: T1566 - Phishing

I need to determine which technique aligns with the initial communication. The report says the malware made a POST request to the C2 domain. POST requests are part of HTTP, which is an application layer protocol. So, T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) seems relevant here because it involves using standard protocols like HTTP for communication.

T1566 is about phishing, which was the method of delivery (malicious document via phishing), but the question is about the communication after execution, not the initial delivery. So D might not be the right choice.

T1001.001 is about junk data, which doesn't seem to fit here. T1595 is about scanning IP blocks, which isn't mentioned in the report.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, as the malware used HTTP to communicate with the C2.
</think>

The question focuses on the technique used for initial communication with the C2 domain. The malware used a POST request, which is part of HTTP, an application layer protocol. This aligns with T1071. Phishing (T1566) was the delivery method, not the communication technique. Other options don't fit the scenario.

Final Answer: C
