Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK tactic corresponds to the RTM APT group using packers as a service after initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the CTI report mentions that the RTM APT group used phishing emails for initial access. That's under the Initial Access tactic. Then, it says they used packers as a service to complicate detection by security tools. I remember that packers are used to obfuscate or encrypt malicious code, making it harder for security tools to detect. 

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, Defense Evasion is about techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. Using packers falls under this because it's a way to hide malicious activity. So after initial access, the next step would be to evade detection, which is Defense Evasion.

The other options don't fit as well. Persistence is about maintaining access, which might come after evasion. Reconnaissance is about gathering info before the attack, which would be before initial access. So the correct answer should be C: Defense Evasion.

The RTM APT group used packers to evade detection after gaining initial access, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
