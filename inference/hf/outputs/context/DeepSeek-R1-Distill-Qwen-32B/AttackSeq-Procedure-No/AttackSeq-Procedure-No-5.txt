Okay, so I need to figure out whether the answer to the question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether recipients, after being presented with a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report, will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 for delivering QuasarRAT only after they've been infected with QuasarRAT.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report talks about Patchwork, an APT group, conducting spear phishing campaigns. They use domains and themes from well-known think tanks like CFR, CSIS, and MERICS. The emails contain links to .doc files, which are actually RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750, which is the Composite Moniker vulnerability. If successful, they drop and execute QuasarRAT.

Looking at the attack sequence: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, Command and Control. The Initial Access phase uses spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting the vulnerability to deliver QuasarRAT. Once the dropper (qrat.exe) is executed, it creates a directory and drops the QuasarRAT binary. It also uses a DLL to create a scheduled task for persistence, ensuring it runs after reboots. Then, the Command and Control phase starts, where the malware communicates with the C2 server.

The question is asking if the recipients will receive spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after being infected. So, does the infection happen before or after the spear phishing emails are sent?

From the report, the spear phishing emails are the initial access vector. The emails are sent first, and if the recipient opens the RTF document, the exploit is triggered, leading to QuasarRAT being dropped. So the infection (QuasarRAT) happens as a result of opening the email, not before. Therefore, the spear phishing emails are the first step, and the infection occurs after opening them, not before.

So the question is whether the emails are sent after the recipient is infected. But according to the report, the emails are the method of infection. So the answer would be No, because the emails are sent first, and the infection happens as a result. The emails aren't sent after the infection; they're the cause of the infection.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit confusingly. It says, "is it likely that they will receive spear phishing emails... only after getting infected with QuasarRAT?" So it's asking if the emails come after the infection. But in reality, the emails are the initial step, so the infection happens because of the emails, not the other way around. Therefore, the answer should be No, because the emails are sent before the infection, not after.

The spear phishing emails are the initial step used to infect recipients with QuasarRAT. The emails are sent first, and the infection occurs as a result of opening the RTF documents. Therefore, the emails are not sent after the infection; they are the cause of it.

Final Answer: B: No
