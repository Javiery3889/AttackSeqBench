Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Nemesis bootkit, after infecting the VBR, is likely to evade detection by placing its install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that the Nemesis bootkit infects the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), which allows it to execute before the Windows operating system boots. This makes detection and removal challenging because it runs before the OS starts, which is a common method for persistence. The report also notes that the malware's installation location ensures it remains even after an OS reinstallation, which is usually a good method for removing malware. 

The report further details that the Nemesis ecosystem includes backdoors with various network protocols and communication channels for command and control (CnC). It has capabilities like file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling. Additionally, the threat group, FIN1, continually updated the malware, adding new functionalities and deploying different variants.

The "Others" section mentions that the use of bootkits like Nemesis is rare and makes the malware difficult to detect and eradicate. It also notes that incident responders need tools to access raw disks because reinstalling the OS isn't enough anymore. The report references other bootkits like TDL4, Necurs, and Rovnix, suggesting that some threat actors use these sophisticated tools when targeting valuable data.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will place its install files into directories excluded from scanning to evade detection. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to determine if the report indicates that Nemesis uses such a technique. The report doesn't explicitly mention hiding files in excluded directories. Instead, it focuses on the bootkit's ability to execute before the OS starts, which inherently makes it harder to detect because most antivirus and scanning tools run after the OS is loaded. 

Placing files in directories excluded from scanning is a different evasion technique, often used by malware to hide within the OS's file structure. However, since Nemesis operates at the boot level, it might not need to rely on hiding within the OS's file system in the same way. Instead, its persistence is achieved through the VBR infection, which is a lower-level technique that doesn't depend on the OS's file scanning mechanisms.

Therefore, while the report highlights the difficulty in detection due to the bootkit's execution before the OS, it doesn't provide evidence that Nemesis specifically uses directory exclusion for evasion. The primary evasion method here is the bootkit's execution timing, not hiding within the file system.

The CTI report emphasizes that the Nemesis bootkit's evasion primarily stems from its ability to execute before the Windows OS boots, rather than hiding install files in excluded directories. While the report doesn't mention directory exclusion, the bootkit's persistence mechanism already makes detection challenging without relying on such techniques.

Final Answer: B: No
