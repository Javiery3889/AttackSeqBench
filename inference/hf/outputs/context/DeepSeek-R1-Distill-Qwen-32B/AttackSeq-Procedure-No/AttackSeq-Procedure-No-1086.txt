Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware used NirSoft tools to steal user credentials after collecting data from the local system. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report describes an attack where a company received a spearphishing email with an Excel document. The email is from steel@vardhman.com, which seems legitimate. The Excel file had a hidden exploit, CVE-2017-11882, which allowed code execution without macros. So, the initial access was via Spearphishing Attachment (T1193), and execution was through User Execution (T1204).

Next, the defense evasion techniques used were File Deletion (T1107), Hidden Files and Directories (T1158), and Software Packing (T1045). The malware collected data from the local system (T1005). Then, it communicated with a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043 and T1071). The data was encrypted before exfiltration (T1002).

The "Others" section mentions that the attack is attributed to SWEED, which targets precision engineering companies. The malware includes a dropped PE file and a malicious document. The dropping URL is given, and it involved a Microsoft Office exploit and LokiBot.

Now, the question is whether educrety.exe used NirSoft tools to steal credentials after collecting data. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I know that LokiBot is a known malware that's used for credential theft. It typically steals credentials from browsers, email clients, and other applications. NirSoft tools are legitimate software that can be used for various purposes, including password recovery, but they're not inherently malicious. However, sometimes attackers use them as part of their toolkit.

In the report, the collection phase is T1005, which is about collecting data from the local system. The exfiltration is encrypted (T1002). The report doesn't explicitly mention the use of NirSoft tools. Instead, it mentions LokiBot, which is known for credential theft. So, the malware likely used LokiBot's built-in capabilities rather than external tools like NirSoft.

Therefore, it's less likely that educrety.exe used NirSoft tools. The answer is probably No.
</think>

The CTI report details an attack where LokiBot was used, which is known for credential theft. The report doesn't mention NirSoft tools, indicating that LokiBot's own features were likely used for stealing credentials. 

Final Answer: B: No
