Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign is likely to utilize tools to capture mouse movements after capturing credentials. Let me start by going through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report describes the RevengeHotels campaign targeting the hospitality sector. The initial access vector is spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments like Word, Excel, or PDF files. These attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199 and use template injection to execute macros, which then download malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC.

In the Execution section, it mentions that the malware are .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator, which unpack to reveal commercial RATs. There's also a module called ScreenBooking that captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically booking.com. For ProCC campaigns, the malware are Delphi binaries with a customized backdoor that collects data from the clipboard and printer spooler, as well as capturing screenshots.

The Credential Access section states that attackers capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies. They sell credentials, giving other cybercriminals remote access to hotel front desks, allowing them to steal credit card details from administration software.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will use tools to capture mouse movements after capturing credentials. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, the malware's primary functions include capturing credit card data, clipboard data, screenshots, and monitoring web pages. There's no mention of tracking mouse movements. While some RATs can have various capabilities, the report doesn't specify that mouse movement capture is part of their functionality in this campaign.

So, based on the information provided, the malware's focus seems to be on data extraction related to credentials and financial information, not on tracking user interactions like mouse movements. Therefore, it's unlikely that they utilize tools for capturing mouse movements.

The malware in the RevengeHotels campaign focuses on capturing credentials and financial data through methods like monitoring web pages, clipboard data, and screenshots. There is no indication that it captures mouse movements, which are not relevant to their primary objectives.

Final Answer: B: No
