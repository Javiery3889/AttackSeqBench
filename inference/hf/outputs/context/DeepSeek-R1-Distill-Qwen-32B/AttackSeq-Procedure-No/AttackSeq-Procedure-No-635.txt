Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers in the described cyber attack used heap spraying techniques before inserting the malicious JavaScript into the news portal. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details an attack called Operation WizardOpium, which used a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-13720, in Google Chrome. The exploit was delivered through a waterhole attack on a Korean news site. The malicious JavaScript was inserted into the main page, redirecting victims to an exploit landing page. 

The report mentions that the script checked the victim's system for compatibility, targeting 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer. After the exploit, the malware installed tasks in the Task Scheduler and downloaded an encrypted binary, which was decrypted and executed as updata.exe. The main module, msdisp64.exe, then communicated with a C2 server to download further stages.

Now, the question is about whether heap spraying was used before the JavaScript insertion to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute shellcode. Heap spraying is a technique often used in exploits to increase the chances of successfully gaining control over execution flow, especially in memory corruption vulnerabilities. It involves filling the heap with a specific pattern so that when a buffer overflow occurs, the exploit can reliably jump to the sprayed area.

Looking at the report, it doesn't explicitly mention heap spraying. Instead, it talks about the exploit being delivered via a JavaScript that redirects to a landing page. The exploit uses AJAX requests to download exploit code chunks and employs RC4 for decryption. The JavaScript also uses BigInt for 64-bit arithmetic and has some debugging code.

Heap spraying is typically associated with exploits that rely on memory corruption, such as buffer overflows. However, the exploit in question is CVE-2019-13720, which I should look up to understand its nature. From what I recall, CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome. Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program continues to use a pointer to memory after it has been freed, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the memory is reallocated or overwritten.

In such cases, heap spraying might be used to control the content of the freed memory chunk, making it more predictable and increasing the chances of successful exploitation. However, the report doesn't mention heap spraying techniques. Instead, it focuses on the delivery mechanism, the use of JavaScript, and the subsequent steps after the exploit.

The question is asking if it's likely that heap spraying was used before the JavaScript insertion. Since the report doesn't mention heap spraying, and the exploit is a use-after-free, which might not necessarily require heap spraying, I have to consider whether it's a common practice in such exploits.

Use-after-free vulnerabilities often involve controlling the allocation of memory after it's been freed. Heap spraying could be a method to influence where the memory is reallocated, but it's not the only method. Alternatively, the exploit might have used other techniques to control the memory, such as specific triggers or leveraging other parts of the application's memory layout.

Given that the report doesn't mention heap spraying and focuses on the exploit's delivery and subsequent steps, it's less likely that heap spraying was a part of the initial exploit. The exploit might have relied on other methods to achieve arbitrary code execution without needing to spray the heap.

Therefore, considering the information provided, it's not likely that heap spraying was utilized in this specific attack scenario.
</think>

The CTI report describes an attack using CVE-2019-13720, a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome. While heap spraying is a common technique in memory corruption exploits, the report does not mention its use. The exploit focused on delivering malicious JavaScript through a waterhole attack, redirecting victims, and using AJAX and RC4 for decryption. Since heap spraying isn't referenced and the exploit's nature might not require it, it's unlikely that heap spraying was used.

Final Answer: B: No
