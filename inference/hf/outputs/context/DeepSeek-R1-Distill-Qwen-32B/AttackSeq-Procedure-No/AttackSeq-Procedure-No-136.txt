Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in the described CTI report would likely attempt to disable security tools by modifying EDR-related services to disable auto-start on system reboot before downloading and executing a backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand the attack sequence. The report mentions that the initial access was through a watering hole attack exploiting CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript vulnerability. Once they gain access, the malware executes a multi-stage infection process. The first stage is the downloader, which checks for antivirus processes and exits if any are found. It also exploits another vulnerability, CVE-2015-1701, for privilege escalation. Then, it downloads and executes the SLUB backdoor.

The question is about whether the attackers would disable EDR services before downloading the backdoor. The report says the downloader checks for antivirus processes and exits if any are found. That suggests they are trying to avoid detection by security tools. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention modifying EDR services to disable auto-start on reboot.

So, the key points are:
1. The downloader exits if antivirus processes are detected.
2. The report doesn't mention any actions to modify EDR services or disable auto-start.

The question is about whether they would attempt to disable EDR services. Since the report only mentions checking for antivirus processes and exiting, it doesn't provide evidence that they modify EDR services. Therefore, it's not clear that they would do that step. They might be trying to avoid detection by exiting, but not necessarily by modifying system services.

So, the answer would likely be "No" because the report doesn't indicate that they took such an action. They just checked for antivirus and exited if found, but didn't modify EDR services to disable auto-start.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that the attackers' downloader checks for antivirus processes and exits if detected, suggesting an attempt to avoid detection. However, there is no mention of modifying EDR services to disable auto-start on reboot. Therefore, it is not likely that they performed such an action.

Final Answer: B: No
