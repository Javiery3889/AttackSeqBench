Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the BlackEnergy 3 malware used legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTY for maintaining remote access before doing internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the adversaries delivered the RAT via phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments. Employees had to enable macros to install BlackEnergy 3. Once installed, the malware placed malicious files on the workstations. The report then talks about credential harvesting and network discovery functions conducted by the delivered BE3 plugins.

Looking at the steps, after initial access (step 3 and 4), the next steps involve credential access (step 7) and discovery (steps 8 and 9). The report says that the BE3 plugins were used for credential harvesting and network discovery. It also mentions that the VS.dll plugin likely used PsExec to establish remote connections. PsExec is a legitimate Microsoft utility, so that's a point towards using legitimate tools.

However, the question specifically asks about AnyDesk and PuTTY. The report doesn't mention these tools explicitly. It does talk about using the DMS server via VPN and native remote access services, but not AnyDesk or PuTTY. The exploitation methods mentioned include using valid credentials and BE3 plugins, but not third-party tools like AnyDesk or PuTTY.

So, while the malware did use legitimate utilities (like PsExec), the specific tools mentioned in the question aren't part of the attack sequence described. Therefore, it's unlikely that AnyDesk or PuTTY were used in this particular case.

The CTI report indicates that the BlackEnergy 3 malware utilized legitimate utilities such as PsExec for remote access, but there is no mention of AnyDesk or PuTTY being used. The attack sequence relied on BE3 plugins and PsExec for network discovery and credential harvesting. Therefore, the use of AnyDesk and PuTTY is not supported by the report.

Final Answer: B: No
