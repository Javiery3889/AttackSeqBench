Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let me list out the tactics and what each involved:

1. **Reconnaissance**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded into memory without writing to disk. They gathered output files and then deleted them. This is part of the Discovery phase, which is under the Reconnaissance tactic.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploited IIS servers using deserialization attacks, including a 0-day.

3. **Execution**: They executed memory-resident malware called NodeIISWeb.

4. **Persistence**: They used web shells and a custom framework, NodeIISWeb, which operates in-memory. They also removed disk tools after use, focusing on stealth.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They used PotatoEx.dll and other techniques like DLL loading, code injection, and token manipulation.

6. **Defense Evasion**: Actively interfered with logging, evaded EDRs, and used in-memory operations to avoid detection.

7. **Credential Access**: Modified login pages to steal credentials in plaintext.

8. **Discovery**: As mentioned, they used SharpHound and PowerSploit in memory, then deleted output files.

9. **Command and Control**: NodeIISWeb provided backdoor functionality with various actions like file manipulation and system info gathering.

Now, the question is about whether TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during Lateral Movement. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of Lateral Movement tactics. The report goes up to Command and Control but doesn't detail how they moved laterally. However, I can infer based on their behavior.

TG1021 focused heavily on in-memory operations, removing tools after use, and evading detection. They used credential access by modifying login pages, which suggests they might have credentials, possibly including domain or admin credentials. If they have credentials, they could use them for lateral movement, perhaps via RDP or other means.

But the question specifically asks about abusing a SAML token from an AD FS server. SAML tokens are used for single sign-on, so compromising an AD FS server could allow them to generate or steal tokens for lateral movement.

However, the report doesn't mention any activities related to AD FS, SAML, or lateral movement techniques. They did use credential access, but it was through modifying login pages, not necessarily compromising AD FS.

Moreover, their focus was on stealth and in-memory operations, which might suggest they prefer methods that don't require persistence or leave traces. Lateral movement via SAML tokens might be more complex and could potentially leave more traces if not handled carefully.

Given that the report doesn't mention any activities related to AD FS or SAML, and their methods were more about in-memory and stealth, it's less likely they would use such a method unless it's part of their known TTPs. Since the report doesn't indicate that, I'm leaning towards No.

But wait, they did use credential access, which could include stealing credentials that might be used for lateral movement. However, the question is specifically about SAML tokens from AD FS. Without evidence of targeting AD FS, it's speculative.

So, considering the information given, the answer is likely No because there's no indication they targeted AD FS or used SAML tokens. Their lateral movement methods, if any, aren't detailed, but their focus was on other areas.

The CTI report details TG1021's attack sequence, which includes Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, and Command and Control. Notably, the report does not mention any activities related to Lateral Movement, specifically the abuse of AD FS servers or SAML tokens. TG1021's methods focused on in-memory operations and stealth, with credential access achieved through modifying login pages rather than compromising AD FS. Without evidence of targeting AD FS or using SAML tokens, it is unlikely they would employ such tactics. 

Final Answer: B: No
