Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report talks about the OceanLotus group using a custom downloader called KerrDown. They deliver this malware through two methods: Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros and RAR archives with DLL side-loading. The RAR files have Vietnamese names, targeting Vietnam or Vietnamese speakers.

Looking at the attack sequence, the initial access is through these Office documents or RARs. The report mentions that the Office documents have macros, which are a common way to execute malicious code. When the user enables the macro, it likely triggers the download or execution of the payload.

Next, the Defense Evasion section says that the actors used a VBS decode function from Motobit to decode base64 blobs. The KerrDown DLL is dropped in a specific directory and retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it with DES, and executes it in memory. So, the payload is decoded from base64, but this happens after the DLL is executed.

The Command and Control part mentions that the payload is Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is downloaded based on the OS architecture. So, the KerrDown downloader checks the system architecture and fetches the appropriate payload.

Now, the question is about whether the Office document uses base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture before showing an image to enable macros. Let me think about the sequence here.

When the user opens the Office document, they might see an image prompting them to enable macros. Once macros are enabled, the malicious code (VBA) runs. The VBA might then use the VBS decode function to decode base64 data. This data could be the KerrDown DLL or a part of it. The DLL is then executed, which in turn checks the system architecture to download the correct payload from a URL.

Wait, but the report says that the DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it, and executes it in memory. So the base64 decoding is part of the DLL's functionality, not necessarily the Office document's macro. The macro might just be the initial trigger to execute the DLL, which then handles the rest.

So, the Office document's macro doesn't directly use base64 blobs based on system architecture. Instead, the macro likely executes the VBS script that decodes the base64 data, which is part of the initial payload delivery. The system architecture check is done by the DLL after it's been executed, to fetch the correct payload.

Therefore, the Office document's macro doesn't itself use base64 blobs based on the system architecture. The base64 decoding is a step in the process, but it's the DLL that handles the architecture-specific payload retrieval. The image in the Office document is just a social engineering tactic to trick the user into enabling macros.

So, the answer would be No, because the Office document doesn't use base64 blobs based on system architecture. The base64 decoding is part of the subsequent steps after the macro is enabled, and the system architecture check is done by the DLL, not the Office document itself.
</think>

The Office document's macro does not directly use base64 blobs based on the victim's system architecture. Instead, the macro triggers the execution of the VBS script, which decodes base64 data. The system architecture check occurs later when the DLL retrieves the appropriate payload. Therefore, the Office document does not use base64 blobs based on system architecture before showing the image.

Final Answer: B: No
