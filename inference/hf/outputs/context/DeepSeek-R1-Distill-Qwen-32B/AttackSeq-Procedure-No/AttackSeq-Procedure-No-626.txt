Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor from the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after establishing communication with C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details several MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by the campaign. Let's go through each part relevant to the question.

The report mentions that the Command and Control (C2) communication uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The traffic is SSL-encrypted and can bypass HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies. The C2 domain is hardcoded and obfuscated, and they use RSA encryption for the AES key exchange. They also mention using proxy tools like pcheck, GO SOCKS5, and PuTTY.

The question is asking if, after establishing C2 communication, the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. The options are Yes or No.

So, I need to determine if the backdoor is likely to switch to a different protocol (like HTTPS or SMTPS) for data exfiltration, separate from their established C2 channels.

Looking at the report, the C2 communication is already using HTTPS (since it's SSL-encrypted) and HTTP. They also use DNS tunneling. The backdoor communicates with the C2 servers over these protocols, and the data is encrypted using AES with RSA for key exchange. They also use proxies, which suggests they're trying to hide their traffic.

Now, the question is about exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. So, would they use a different protocol than their C2 for exfiltration?

In the report, the C2 uses tunneling over DNS and HTTP, and the traffic is SSL-encrypted. So, they're already using HTTPS for C2. If they were to exfiltrate data, it's possible they might use the same C2 channels since they've already established encrypted communication. Using a different protocol like SMTPS might be less likely because it's another channel that could be monitored, and they might prefer to keep everything under the radar using their existing C2 infrastructure.

Moreover, the report doesn't mention any use of SMTPS or other protocols for data exfiltration. It only talks about the C2 using DNS and HTTP with SSL. So, there's no indication that they switch to a different protocol for exfiltration.

Therefore, it's unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor would exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol because they're already using HTTPS in their C2 communication. They might stick to their established channels to avoid detection.

The SombRAT backdoor uses HTTPS for C2 communication, so it's unlikely to switch to a non-C2 protocol like SMTPS for exfiltration. They likely stick to their established encrypted channels to remain undetected.

Final Answer: B: No
