Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Machete divides files into smaller chunks if they're 0x1000000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what information I can gather.

First, the report mentions that Machete is involved in several MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The question is about the Collection phase, specifically after certain activities like stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data. The question is whether Machete would split large files (over 0x1000000 bytes, which is 1MB) before exfiltration.

Looking at the Collection section of the report: It says Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs were encrypted. There's no mention of file size limits or splitting files into smaller parts during exfiltration.

The Command and Control section mentions that Machete uses standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication and can use fallback channels. It also says that it can download additional files and uses FTP and HTTP for C&C. However, nothing here indicates that it splits files based on size.

I know that some malware does split large files to avoid detection, especially if they're using certain protocols or to bypass size restrictions. But the report doesn't explicitly state that Machete does this. It only mentions that data is encrypted and staged in a temporary folder. 

Since the report doesn't provide any information about file size handling during exfiltration, I can't assume that Machete does this. The answer choices are Yes or No, and without evidence, I should lean towards the default, which is No, unless it's stated otherwise.

So, based on the information given, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details Machete's activities during the Collection phase, including stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and encrypting data in a temporary folder. However, it does not mention any process of dividing large files into smaller chunks before exfiltration. Since there's no evidence of such behavior, the most plausible answer is that Machete does not split files based on size.

Final Answer: B: No
