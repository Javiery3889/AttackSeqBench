Okay, so I need to figure out whether the spyware in question automatically collects data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration after extracting Chrome passwords. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what information is provided.

First, the report mentions that the initial access is through an installer named 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe, which contains SecondEye components. The installer isn't a valid InnoSetup, so it's probably from another tool like Smart Install Maker. It places spyware in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps directory and runs sysCrt32.exe, along with a legitimate InnoSetup installer for the VPN.

Looking at the Execution section, sysCrt32.exe handles persistence by adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% and sets up scheduled tasks for sysBus32.exe every 3 hours. sysBus32.exe then downloads and executes the second stage from the C2 server. Other executables like libCache32.exe, libTemp32.exe, and libchrome.exe are involved. Specifically, libchrome.exe is responsible for keylogging, clipboard logging, and Chrome password extraction.

In the Credential Access section, it's confirmed that libchrome.exe queries Chrome's SQLite databases for usernames and passwords and uses tokens from Local State and Login Data files to decrypt them.

The Command and Control part talks about the C2 servers and how the malware uses curl.exe to access FTP servers. Exfiltration is handled by sysUp32.bat, which collects files from the components and uploads them, including Chrome passwords and crypto-wallet data.

Now, the question is whether the spyware automatically collects data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images. From the report, I see that libCache32.exe and libTemp32.exe are part of the execution process. The report mentions that libchrome.exe does keylogging and clipboard logging, but it doesn't explicitly state whether it captures screen images or USB drive data.

Wait, the report says libchrome.exe is for keylogging, clipboard logging, and Chrome password extraction. So keylogging is covered, which would include keystrokes. But what about screen captures and USB drives? The report doesn't mention anything about screen captures or USB drive data collection. It only talks about keylogging, clipboard, and Chrome data.

So, the question is whether the spyware does all three: USB, keystrokes, and screen images. Since the report only mentions keystrokes (via keylogging) and Chrome data, but not screen captures or USB drives, I can't assume it does those unless it's explicitly stated.

Therefore, it's not likely that the spyware automatically collects data from USB drives and screen images. It does collect keystrokes through keylogging, but the other two aren't mentioned. So the answer would be No, it's not likely to do all three automatically.

The CTI report details the spyware's activities, including keylogging and Chrome password extraction, but does not mention screen captures or USB drive data collection. Therefore, it's unlikely the spyware automatically collects all three types of data.

Final Answer: B
