Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper after the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor awaits commands from C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by Agrius. Let's go through each tactic mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: They exploited public-facing applications, using known vulnerabilities like FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day exploits, and SQL injection. This led to uploading webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution**: They deployed custom malware, specifically a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor was used for exfiltrating data and deploying more malware. It could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

3. **Persistence**: They used webshells and registered 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.

4. **Defense Evasion**: The webshells were obfuscated with a custom base64 function. The backdoor could update itself and delete traces to avoid detection.

5. **Lateral Movement**: They used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts. They also used publicly available tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

6. **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicated over HTTP with C2 servers, which sent commands like updating relays, sending recon info, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is about whether Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper after the backdoor awaits commands. CaddyWiper is known for wiping files, especially related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical partitions.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of data destruction activities or the use of CaddyWiper. The report focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and C2. The backdoor's capabilities include exfiltration, command execution, file upload, and self-deletion, but not data wiping.

CaddyWiper is a specific tool used for destruction, which isn't mentioned here. The report doesn't indicate that Agrius engaged in data destruction beyond possibly self-deletion of the backdoor. Their main activities seem to be about gaining access, moving laterally, and exfiltrating data, not wiping systems.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there's no evidence that Agrius uses CaddyWiper. The answer would likely be no.

The CTI report details Agrius' tactics, which include initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. However, it does not mention any data destruction activities or the deployment of CaddyWiper. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor's capabilities focus on exfiltration and self-deletion, not wiping files. Therefore, there's no indication that Agrius uses CaddyWiper.

Final Answer: B: No
