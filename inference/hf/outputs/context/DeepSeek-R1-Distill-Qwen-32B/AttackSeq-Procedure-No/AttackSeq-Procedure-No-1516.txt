Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the backdoor in the CTI report is likely to deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the report describes an attack where the threat actors used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX and RTF files. These documents exploited Microsoft Office vulnerabilities to install a backdoor. The backdoor then communicated with a C&C server, exfiltrating data like files, screenshots, and system info.

Now, the question is about whether this backdoor would deploy CaddyWiper, which is known for wiping files related to OT capabilities and physical drives. I remember that CaddyWiper is associated with specific APT groups, like APT29 or others, and is often used in attacks targeting critical infrastructure, especially OT environments.

Looking at the report, the attackers are a Chinese APT group that's been active for a few years. Their tools include RoyalRoad, which is used for exploits, and they have a backdoor with exfiltration capabilities. The report doesn't mention any wiper malware or destruction activities. Instead, the focus is on surveillance and data collection.

CaddyWiper's primary purpose is destruction, wiping data, which is different from the exfiltration and espionage activities described here. The report doesn't indicate any intent to destroy data, only to collect it. So, it's unlikely that this particular backdoor would deploy CaddyWiper. The attackers seem focused on intelligence gathering rather than sabotage.

Therefore, the answer is probably B: No.

The CTI report details an attack involving a Chinese APT group using spear-phishing to install a backdoor for data exfiltration. The backdoor's activities are centered on surveillance and espionage, with no mention of destructive actions. CaddyWiper, known for data wiping, is typically used in sabotage, which isn't indicated here. Thus, the backdoor is unlikely to deploy CaddyWiper.

Final Answer: B
