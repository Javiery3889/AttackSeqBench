Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices hides its icon and runs in the background after sending the gathered information, including processes data, via HTTP to the C2 server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that the XAgent app is fully functional malware. On iOS 7, when installed, the app's icon is hidden, and it runs in the background immediately. If you try to terminate it by killing the process, it restarts almost immediately. However, on iOS 8, the icon isn't hidden, and it can't restart automatically, suggesting it was designed before iOS 8 was released in September 2014.

The report also details the Command and Control (C2) communication. The app sends information via HTTP using POST requests and receives commands via GET requests. The logs are in HTML with color coding, and the URIs are randomly generated from a template. There's a token used for module identification, which is Base64 encoded with a random prefix. Additionally, the app can upload files via FTP.

Now, the question is about the sequence of actions after the app collects a list of processes for discovery. Specifically, does it hide its icon and run in the background on iOS 7 only after sending the gathered information via HTTP?

From the report, the key points are:
1. On iOS 7, the app hides its icon and runs in the background immediately upon installation.
2. The app sends information via HTTP, but the report doesn't specify the exact timing of when this happens relative to the icon hiding and background running.

The question is asking if the hiding and background running occur after sending the information. But according to the report, the hiding and background running happen immediately upon installation, not necessarily after sending data. The sending of data is a separate function, but the report doesn't indicate that the app waits to send data before hiding itself.

So, the sequence is: installation leads to immediate hiding and background running, and then it sends data via HTTP. Therefore, the hiding and running in the background happen before sending the information, not after.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether it's likely that the app hides and runs in the background after sending the data. Since the report says it hides and runs immediately upon installation, the answer would be no, it doesn't do this after sending the data.
</think>

The XAgent app on iOS 7 hides its icon and runs in the background immediately after installation, before sending any data. Therefore, it does not perform these actions after sending the gathered information.

Final Answer: B: No
