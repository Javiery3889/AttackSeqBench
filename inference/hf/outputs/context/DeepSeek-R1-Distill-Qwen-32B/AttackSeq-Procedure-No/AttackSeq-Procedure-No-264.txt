Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Mustang Panda is likely to deploy a UEFI rootkit called LoJax before using control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report talks about a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant called Hodur. The initial access vector is through phishing and watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events. The downloader they use opens a decoy document to distract the victim. 

The report mentions that the campaign uses a custom loader for malware like Cobalt Strike, Poison Ivy, and Korplug. It also notes that they use anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage of deployment. So, control-flow obfuscation is part of their defense evasion tactics.

Now, the question is about whether they deploy a UEFI rootkit (LoJax) before control-flow obfuscation. I know that LoJax is a type of rootkit that targets the UEFI firmware, which is a lower-level part of the system. Rootkits at this level are typically used for persistence and can be harder to detect because they operate below the operating system.

Looking at the report, the persistence mechanism described for Korplug involves creating a directory in %allusersprofile%, setting it as hidden and system, and using scheduled tasks or registry entries. There's no mention of UEFI rootkit activity or LoJax specifically. The report focuses on the loader, execution, persistence, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration phases, all of which are above the OS level.

Control-flow obfuscation is mentioned as a technique used at every deployment stage, which is a form of anti-analysis and defense evasion. This suggests that their obfuscation happens during the execution of the malware, not necessarily tied to a rootkit deployment.

I also recall that LoJax was associated with another group, APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear), not Mustang Panda. Mustang Panda's tactics, as per the report, don't indicate the use of UEFI rootkits. Their methods seem to focus on more traditional persistence mechanisms rather than firmware-level attacks.

So, putting it all together, the report doesn't mention LoJax or UEFI rootkit deployment. Their defense evasion techniques include control-flow obfuscation, but this is separate from using a rootkit. Therefore, it's unlikely that they deploy LoJax before using control-flow obfuscation.

The CTI report details Mustang Panda's use of control-flow obfuscation as part of their defense evasion tactics but does not mention the deployment of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax. LoJax is typically associated with APT28, not Mustang Panda. The report focuses on traditional persistence methods and does not indicate firmware-level attacks. Therefore, it is unlikely that Mustang Panda deploys LoJax before using control-flow obfuscation.

Final Answer: B: No
