Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Carbanak group used LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks as part of their attack sequence. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics in order. The attack starts with Reconnaissance, where they collected data on banking applications and internal procedures. Then, Initial Access was through spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word. Execution involved downloading payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files. Persistence was established using a backdoor from the C&C server. Privilege Escalation happened when they got admin credentials, specifically a Domain Administrator account. Defense Evasion involved operating outside business hours and limiting interactions. Discovery used Cobalt Strike to map the network and collect credentials. Lateral Movement was done to compromise more endpoints. Collection gathered documents for exfiltration, and Command and Control used Cobalt Strike. Exfiltration prepared the documents.

The question is about whether they used LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks during the Discovery phase to map the network and collect admin credentials before escalating privileges. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, during Discovery, it says they used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the network, collect admin credentials, and compromise additional endpoints. It doesn't mention any specific techniques like LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay. These techniques are known for credential theft and network mapping, often used in lateral movement or discovery.

Cobalt Strike is a tool that can perform various actions, including credential dumping and network reconnaissance. However, the report doesn't specify that they used these particular methods. Instead, it just says they used Cobalt Strike for discovery. So, while it's possible that they used these techniques, the report doesn't explicitly state it. The report focuses more on the overall actions rather than the specific tactics used during discovery.

Therefore, without explicit mention of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay, it's not certain that they used these methods. The answer would likely be No because the report doesn't provide evidence of these specific techniques being employed.

The CTI report details the Carbanak group's attack sequence, including their use of Cobalt Strike for discovery and mapping the network. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay attacks. While these techniques are common for credential theft and network mapping, the report focuses on the broader use of Cobalt Strike without specifying these methods. Therefore, it's not confirmed that they were used.

Final Answer: B: No
