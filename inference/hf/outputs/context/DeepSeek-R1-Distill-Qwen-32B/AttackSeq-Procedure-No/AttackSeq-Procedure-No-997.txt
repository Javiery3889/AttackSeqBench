Okay, so I need to figure out whether Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery after using a zero-day exploit. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Longhorn uses a zero-day exploit in a Word document to infect targets with Plexor malware. That's the initial access part. Then, under the Discovery section, it says their malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. So, after infecting the system, the malware is designed to gather information about the compromised system.

The question is asking if, after the initial infection, the tools will perform these fingerprinting and discovery activities. The answer choices are just Yes or No. From the report, it's clear that the malware has these capabilities, so it's likely they do perform these steps.

Additionally, the report mentions that the malware uses operational security measures to remain undetected. This suggests that after gathering information, they would follow tactics to avoid detection, which aligns with the question's mention of following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

So putting it all together, the answer should be Yes because the malware is specifically designed for espionage, which includes system fingerprinting and discovery as part of their attack sequence.

The CTI report indicates that Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage, including system fingerprinting and discovery. After infecting a target with the zero-day exploit, the malware would likely perform these activities before employing tactics to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A
