Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys after discovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting MQTT in medical networks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that during the Discovery phase, they found outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces. Additionally, there are medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that use MQTT and are discoverable online. This suggests that these devices are exposed to the internet, making them potential targets for unauthorized access.

The "Others" section adds context about the threat landscape. It states that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017. Also, APT actors targeted pharmaceutical companies using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to steal data, indicating an interest in intellectual property or business plans. The report recommends mitigating these threats by removing medical data from public access, updating software, and not connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

Now, the question is asking if, after discovering these outdated systems and devices, cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to find more publicly available resources of medical organizations. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I know that Shodan and Censys are search engines that allow users to find specific types of devices or services connected to the internet. They're often used by both security researchers and attackers to discover exposed systems. Given that the report mentions that these devices are discoverable online, it's likely that attackers would use such tools to identify them.

The attack sequence in the report starts with Discovery, which aligns with using tools like Shodan and Censys. These tools help in the initial reconnaissance phase, allowing attackers to find potential entry points. Since the report highlights that these devices are indeed discoverable, it makes sense that attackers would use these tools to find them.

Moreover, the context provided in the "Others" section about malware and APT activities suggests that attackers are actively targeting these organizations. Using Shodan and Censys would be a logical next step after identifying that such devices are exposed.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Yes because the scenario described in the report supports the use of these tools for further discovery.

The CTI report indicates that outdated systems and medical devices are discoverable online, making them targets for cybercriminals. Shodan and Censys are tools used for identifying such exposed resources, fitting the initial reconnaissance phase of an attack. Given the context of active targeting and the presence of exposed devices, it's plausible that attackers would use these tools.

Final Answer: A
