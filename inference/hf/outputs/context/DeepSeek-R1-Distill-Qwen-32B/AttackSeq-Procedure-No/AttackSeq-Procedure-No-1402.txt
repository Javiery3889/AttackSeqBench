Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after their discovery phase. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics for FIN13. Let's break down the relevant sections:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They map networks, capture credentials, and steal documents. They use custom tools and have long dwell times.

2. **Initial Access**: They use web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) to get into the network. The exact vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a common entry point.

3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution and file transfer. BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that listens on high ports and uses cmd.exe for commands.

4. **Persistence**: They replace legitimate binaries like KeePass with trojanized versions. They also use email for C2 with MAILSLOT.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to get credentials. Also, they use certutil for obfuscation.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They use passive backdoors and legitimate utilities to avoid detection. They have custom droppers and malware with recon features.

7. **Credential Access**: They dump LSASS memory and use trojanized KeePass. They also do network sniffing.

8. **Discovery**: They use native OS tools, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal recon. They gather info on networks, users, and services.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shares, stage it locally or remotely, and use utilities to archive data. They target info for fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols. They transfer tools and encode data.

11. **Exfiltration**: They use web services, web shells, and JSP tools to exfiltrate data for fraud.

Now, the question is about whether after discovery, they would use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data.

Looking at the report, during the **Discovery** phase, FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware. The question is about lateral movement after discovery. The report mentions that during **Execution**, they use JSPRAT for command execution and file transfer. They also use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor.

In the **Lateral Movement** tactic, the report doesn't explicitly mention using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy. Instead, they focus on using web shells, custom malware, and possibly other methods. The report doesn't list PDQ Deploy as a tool they use. 

Moreover, the report states that FIN13 uses passive backdoors and custom tools, which suggests they prefer their own methods rather than relying on common software deployment tools. They also use email for C2, which is another method but not related to PDQ Deploy.

Additionally, the report mentions that they have long dwell times and use custom tools, which implies they might not need off-the-shelf deployment tools. They are more likely to use their own malware for movement across the network.

So, considering all this, it's unlikely that FIN13 uses PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. They have their own methods and tools, so the answer would be No.
</think>

The analysis of the CTI report indicates that FIN13 primarily uses custom tools and malware for their operations, including lateral movement. They do not mention the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy. Instead, they rely on their own methods such as web shells, custom malware, and passive backdoors. Therefore, it is unlikely that they use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B: No
