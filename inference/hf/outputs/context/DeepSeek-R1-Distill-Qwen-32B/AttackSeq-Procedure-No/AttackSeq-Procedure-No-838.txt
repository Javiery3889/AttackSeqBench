Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT28, after using spear-phishing to gain initial access, would install and execute a VBA script like vba_macro.exe to drop malware such as FONTCACHE.DAT before using tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details APT28's tactics across several MITRE ATT&CK phases. 

Starting with Initial Access, the report says APT28 uses spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs or exploit documents. These documents are designed to harvest credentials or deliver malware. They've used domains that spoof legitimate organizations and exploited vulnerabilities like Flash and Windows CVEs to install malware when users visit malicious URLs.

Moving on to Defense Evasion, the report mentions that APT28 uses zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and fabricated authorization requests to obtain credentials. They also prefer using legitimate tools already present in the victim's system for lateral movement, sometimes avoiding their traditional tools.

In the Credential Access section, APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials, directing victims to fake login pages or using malicious applications that bypass security measures. They've also used credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

For Lateral Movement, they use strategic web compromises (SWC) to infect users, redirecting from compromised sites, and exploit known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move deeper into networks.

Now, the question is about the sequence of TTPs after initial access. The scenario is: spear-phishing leads to exploit documents, then installing a VBA script (vba_macro.exe) to drop malware (FONTCACHE.DAT), followed by using tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.

I need to check if this sequence aligns with APT28's known tactics.

From the report, APT28 uses spear-phishing to deliver exploit documents, which likely contain malicious code. VBA scripts are a common method for delivering malware, as they can execute on Windows systems. FONTCACHE.DAT is a known malware associated with APT28, used for credential theft and other activities.

After initial access, the next steps would involve establishing persistence and moving laterally. The tools mentioned—CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE—are all part of APT28's toolset. CHOPSTICK is used for credential theft, EVILTOSS for exfiltration, and SOURFACE for lateral movement.

So, the sequence makes sense: initial access via spear-phishing, execution of a VBA script to drop malware, then using their toolset for further activities. The report supports that APT28 uses such methods, including leveraging VBA scripts and known malware, followed by lateral movement tools.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

The analysis confirms that APT28's tactics include using spear-phishing to deliver exploit documents, executing VBA scripts to drop malware, and then employing their toolset for lateral movement and exfiltration. This sequence aligns with the CTI report.
