Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Duke group, after using Seaduke for command and control (C2) with multiple layers of encryption and encoding, is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the Duke group's activities, specifically mentioning their use of Seaduke malware. Under the Command and Control section, it says that Seaduke communicates securely with the C2 server using HTTP/HTTPS, with layers of encoding (like Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES). It also mentions that the attackers can control Seaduke similarly to Cozyduke, and the Seaduke infrastructure is distinct, allowing sub-teams to exploit the network concurrently.

Now, the question is about whether data exfiltration happens over the same C2 channel. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, under the Collection section, it states that Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update configurations, upload and download files, and delete the malware. This suggests that Seaduke has the capability to handle file transfers, which would include exfiltration.

Additionally, the Defense Evasion section mentions that Seaduke uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to hide its activities. This implies that the same secure communication channels used for C2 could also be used for data exfiltration, as the encryption would help avoid detection.

Moreover, the report doesn't explicitly state that they use a different channel for exfiltration. It's more efficient for attackers to use the same encrypted channel for both C2 and data transfer to minimize the number of channels they need to maintain and secure.

So, putting it together, since Seaduke's C2 uses secure, encrypted communication and the malware has the capability to upload and download files, it's likely that data exfiltration occurs over the same channel.

The Duke group uses Seaduke for secure C2 communication with multiple layers of encryption. Seaduke's capabilities include file transfer, which suggests data exfiltration over the same channel. The report doesn't indicate a separate channel, making it likely they use the same encrypted C2 for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
