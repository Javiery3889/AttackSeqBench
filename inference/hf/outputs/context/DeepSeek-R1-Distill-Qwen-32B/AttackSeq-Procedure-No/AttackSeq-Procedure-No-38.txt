Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Machete multiplies the first two octets of an IP address and adds the third octet to get a command and control port before exfiltrating data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the Machete campaign's tactics across various MITRE ATT&CK phases. The question is about the exfiltration process, specifically whether Machete uses a certain method to determine the C&C port.

From the report, under the Exfiltration section, it says that Machete automatically exfiltrates all collected files to remote servers. The data is encrypted with AES and sometimes base64 encoded. It also mentions that browser profile data is compressed as .zip files before exfiltration. The exfiltration uses the same channel as command and control (C&C), with scheduled transfers every 10 minutes. Additionally, data can be copied to a removable drive if a special file is present.

Now, the question is asking if Machete multiplies the first two octets of an IP address and adds the third octet to get the C&C port. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I don't recall the report mentioning anything about manipulating IP octets to determine ports. The report talks about encryption methods, compression, and the use of the same C&C channel for exfiltration, but it doesn't specify how the port is determined. Typically, C&C ports are either hardcoded or use standard ports like 80 or 443, or they might be dynamically determined through other means, but the report doesn't provide evidence of this specific method.

Moreover, the question is about a specific technical detail that isn't mentioned in the report. Since the report doesn't discuss how the port is calculated, I can't assume that Machete uses this method. It's possible that the port is static or determined another way, but without explicit information, I shouldn't infer it.

Therefore, based on the information given, there's no indication that Machete uses the described method to calculate the C&C port. The answer should be No.

The CTI report does not provide any information about Machete using a method to calculate the C&C port by manipulating IP octets. It only mentions that data is exfiltrated over the same C&C channel, encrypted, and sometimes base64 encoded. There's no evidence of the specific port calculation method described.

Final Answer: B
