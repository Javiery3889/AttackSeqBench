Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether adversaries who use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase would likely develop malicious npm packages for delivery or retrieval during the Resource Development phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details various MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by adversaries. In the Reconnaissance section, it mentions that adversaries use tools like masscan and Shodan to scan for vulnerable Docker APIs. They use a function called DOCKERGEDDON, which includes masscan and zgrab to detect compromised Docker APIs, collect information, and deploy malicious containers.

Moving on to the Initial Access phase, the report states that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports. They also created fake public registry accounts, like a typo-squatting version of Tensorflow, to trick developers into pulling malicious images. This suggests that they are targeting the supply chain, specifically Docker Hub and other CI/CD platforms.

The question is about whether they would develop malicious npm packages. Npm is the package manager for Node.js, and malicious npm packages are a known vector for supply chain attacks. The report mentions that adversaries targeted Docker Hub, GitHub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, which are all part of the software development ecosystem. They used these to execute crypto miners during the auto-build process, indicating a focus on supply chain attacks.

In the Execution phase, the report talks about using command interpreters and scripts, but not specifically npm. However, the fact that they targeted Docker Hub and other CI/CD tools suggests they are looking for ways to inject malicious code into development pipelines. Since npm packages are widely used and can be easily distributed, it's plausible that adversaries would target them as part of their resource development.

Additionally, the report mentions that adversaries are using worms to spread further, which implies they are looking for efficient ways to propagate their attacks. Developing malicious npm packages could be an effective method for this, as they can be distributed through trusted channels and executed during builds or installations.

The report also notes that over 90% of the attacks involved cryptocurrency mining, but there's an emerging trend towards backdoors and credential theft. This indicates a shift towards more sophisticated attacks, which might include leveraging npm packages for broader impact.

Considering all this, it seems likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages as part of their resource development phase. They are already targeting supply chain components, and npm packages fit into that strategy well.

The adversaries' tactics, as outlined in the CTI report, involve targeting supply chain components such as Docker Hub and CI/CD platforms. Their use of malicious Docker images and exploitation of misconfigurations suggests a focus on supply chain attacks. Given that npm packages are a critical part of the software development ecosystem and can be easily distributed, it is plausible that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages to further their objectives, such as spreading worms or executing crypto mining scripts. This aligns with their observed behavior of seeking efficient propagation methods and leveraging trusted channels for attacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
