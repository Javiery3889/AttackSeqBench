Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating data. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by FIN13. Let's list out the tactics and the techniques they used:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They map networks, capture credentials, steal documents.
2. **Initial Access**: They use web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution and file transfer, and BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor.
4. **Persistence**: They replace KeePass binaries, use SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for C2 via email.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, certutil, and trojanized KeePass.
6. **Defense Evasion**: They use passive backdoors, web shells, certutil, LATCHKEY, and DRAWSTRING.
7. **Credential Access**: They dump LSASS, network sniffing, target unsecured credentials, and use trojanized KeePass.
8. **Discovery**: They use OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for recon.
9. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
10. **Collection**: They collect data from network shares, archive it locally or remotely.
11. **Exfiltration**: They use web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

The question is about whether, after collecting data, they use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltration. The options are Yes or No.

Looking at the Exfiltration section, it says they use web shells and JSP tools. There's no mention of DNS Calculation techniques. DNS Calculation is a specific method where they might calculate a C2 port using IP octets, but the report doesn't indicate that.

In the Defense Evasion section, they use passive backdoors and legitimate utilities but nothing about DNS. Their C2 is via email (MAILSLOT) and web shells, not DNS-based.

So, based on the report, there's no evidence that FIN13 uses DNS Calculation. Therefore, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details FIN13's tactics, including their use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration, but does not mention DNS Calculation techniques. Their command and control methods involve email and web-based tools, not DNS-based methods. 

Final Answer: B: No
