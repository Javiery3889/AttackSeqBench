Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the encoded PowerShell script executes before being retrieved via a VBS macro and then downloads the payloads for Ursnif and GandCrab. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes a campaign where phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros are used. The initial access is achieved through these phishing emails. The Word document, named 'Richard_Johnson.doc', has embedded VBS macros. When the user opens the document, the macro runs.

The macro then executes a PowerShell script. The report mentions that the PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages a DCOM object to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk. The script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers, first using DownloadString and then DownloadData methods to get the payloads.

The payloads are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. So, the sequence is: phishing email -> Word document with macro -> macro executes PowerShell -> PowerShell downloads payloads from C2 -> payloads are executed.

Now, the question is asking if the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and then download the payloads. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It says, "is it likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware?"

Hmm, so the question is about the order of execution. Does the PowerShell script execute before being retrieved via the VBS macro? Or does the VBS macro retrieve the PowerShell script, which then executes?

From the report, the VBS macro is embedded in the Word document. When the user opens the document, the macro runs. The macro then executes the PowerShell script. So the VBS macro is the initial trigger that runs the PowerShell script. The PowerShell script is not retrieved via the macro; rather, the macro runs the script.

Wait, but the report says the macro executes the PowerShell script. So the VBS macro is part of the initial access vector, and it's the one that triggers the PowerShell script execution. The PowerShell script is embedded or called by the macro.

Wait, no, the report says the macro executes the PowerShell script. So the VBS macro is the initial step, and it runs the PowerShell script. The PowerShell script then communicates with the C2 servers to download the payloads.

So the sequence is: VBS macro runs -> executes PowerShell script -> PowerShell downloads payloads.

So the PowerShell script is executed by the VBS macro. Therefore, the PowerShell script doesn't execute before being retrieved via the macro; rather, the macro retrieves and executes it.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro." That seems a bit off because the macro is what triggers the script. So the script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. Or perhaps the macro retrieves the script from somewhere else?

Wait, the report says the macro executes the PowerShell script. It doesn't mention the script being retrieved from another source. So the script is likely embedded within the macro or the document. So the macro runs, which then runs the PowerShell script, which then communicates with C2 to download the payloads.

So the PowerShell script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. Therefore, the script is already present and runs when the macro runs. So the script doesn't need to be retrieved; it's already there.

Wait, but the report says the macro executes the PowerShell script, which then uses Webclient to download payloads. So the script is part of the macro's execution, not retrieved from elsewhere. So the script is already in the macro, and when the macro runs, it runs the script.

Therefore, the PowerShell script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. So the question is asking if the script executes before being retrieved via the macro, which doesn't make sense because the macro is what runs the script, not retrieves it.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the macro retrieves the PowerShell script from somewhere else, then executes it. But the report doesn't mention that. It just says the macro executes the PowerShell script. So perhaps the script is embedded in the macro.

In that case, the script is executed by the macro, so the script runs after the macro runs. So the script doesn't execute before being retrieved via the macro; the macro runs, which then runs the script.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro." That seems like the script is retrieved by the macro, which would mean the macro gets the script from somewhere else, then runs it. But the report doesn't say that. It says the macro executes the script, implying the script is part of the macro.

So perhaps the answer is No, because the script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. Or maybe the question is implying that the script is retrieved via the macro, which isn't the case here.

Wait, the question is asking if the script executes only before being retrieved via the macro. That would mean the script runs first, then the macro retrieves it, which doesn't make sense because the macro is what runs the script.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking if the script is retrieved via the macro before executing, but that's not the case here. The macro runs, which then runs the script.

So the correct sequence is: macro runs -> script runs -> script downloads payloads.

Therefore, the script doesn't execute before being retrieved via the macro; the macro runs, which then runs the script. So the answer would be No, because the script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. Let me read it again: "is it likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware?"

So the question is suggesting that the script executes before being retrieved via the macro, which would mean the script runs first, then the macro retrieves it. But that's not the case. The macro runs first, which then runs the script.

Therefore, the answer is No, because the script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. So the script doesn't execute before being retrieved via the macro; the macro runs, which then runs the script.

Alternatively, if the script is retrieved via the macro, that would mean the macro gets the script from somewhere else, but the report doesn't mention that. It just says the macro executes the script.

So I think the answer is No, because the script is executed by the macro, not retrieved by it. Therefore, the script doesn't execute before being retrieved via the macro; the macro runs, which then runs the script.
</think>

The question asks whether the PowerShell script executes before being retrieved via a VBS macro. The CTI report indicates that the VBS macro within the phishing email's Word document executes the PowerShell script. The script then communicates with C2 servers to download payloads. The script is not retrieved by the macro but is instead executed by it. Therefore, the script does not execute before being retrieved via the macro; the macro runs first, which then runs the script.

Final Answer: B: No
