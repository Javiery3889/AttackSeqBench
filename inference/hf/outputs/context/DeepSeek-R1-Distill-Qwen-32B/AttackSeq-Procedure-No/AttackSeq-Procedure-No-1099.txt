Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details several MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by CosmicDuke. Let's go through each part relevant to the question.

1. **Initial Access**: The report mentions that CosmicDuke uses document-based exploits, specifically a malicious Flash object in a PDF exploiting CVE-2011-0611. They also use social engineering to trick users into opening these files.

2. **Execution**: The malware uses a loader inherited from MiniDuke. The loader was updated, and CosmicDuke started using this updated version in mid-April 2014.

3. **Persistence**: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence. It copies itself to the system32 directory with various filenames.

4. **Credential Access**: It steals a variety of credentials, including from browsers, email clients, and Windows credentials. It also exports certificates with a specific password.

5. **Discovery**: The malware searches for specific file patterns, including encrypted files, on hard drives and network drives.

6. **Collection**: It uses keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing to gather information. It also looks for files on removable drives.

7. **Exfiltration**: The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP. The report mentions the login credentials and FTP folder structure used.

Now, the question is asking if CosmicDuke communicates via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information. Let's analyze this.

From the report, under Exfiltration, it's clear that CosmicDuke uses FTP to upload data. However, there's no mention of WebDav being used. The question also asks about updating before collecting information. The report doesn't explicitly state whether CosmicDuke uses WebDav for updates or if it communicates via WebDav at all. It only mentions FTP for exfiltration.

The answer choices are Yes or No. The question is whether both FTP and WebDav are used for exfiltration and updating before collection. Since the report only confirms FTP usage and doesn't mention WebDav, the answer would be No because WebDav isn't indicated as part of their communication methods.

The CTI report indicates that CosmicDuke uses FTP for exfiltration but does not mention WebDav. Therefore, it's unlikely that WebDav is used for communication. 

Final Answer: B: No
