Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Konni APT Group uses kernel modules for persistence after deleting certain files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the attack sequence of the Konni APT Group. They started with an ISO file containing malicious scripts. The initial access involved delivering an ISO via an ITW URL, which then had a zip file with malicious scripts. 

Looking at the execution phase, they used several VBScripts and batch files. The scripts like 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', and 'unactivate.vbs' were involved. 'stopedge.bat' was used to schedule 'install.vbs' every 33 minutes and manage file deletions. 'resolvedns.bat' downloaded a file from the C2 server, and 'versioninfo.bat' collected system info and exfiltrated data.

Defense evasion was done through obfuscation of scripts and deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution. The 'stopedge.bat' script was part of this defense evasion by removing indicators.

Now, the question is about whether persistence is established using kernel modules, like in Drovorub or Skidmap. I know that Drovorub and Skidmap are known for using kernel-level persistence, which is a more advanced technique to maintain access even after reboots.

Looking at the report, the persistence mechanism mentioned is 'stopedge.bat' scheduling 'install.vbs' every 33 minutes. This is a user-level persistence method, not kernel-level. Kernel modules would involve modifying the operating system's kernel, which wasn't mentioned in the report. The report doesn't indicate any use of kernel-level techniques or rootkits, which are typical for groups like Drovorub or Skidmap.

Therefore, since the persistence here is script-based and not kernel-based, the answer is likely no.

The Konni APT Group's persistence mechanism involves scheduling a script to run periodically, which is a user-level technique. They do not use kernel modules, as indicated by the absence of such methods in the report. Therefore, they are not employing techniques similar to Drovorub or Skidmap.

Final Answer: B: No
