Okay, so I need to figure out whether Vyveva, the Lazarus backdoor, divides files into chunks of 0x1000000 bytes or more during exfiltration after compressing them with zlib. Let me go through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Collection tactic, Vyveva compresses files using zlib (T1560.002) and collects files (T1005). It also notifies the C&C about removable media and collects files from them (T1025). Then, in the Command and Control section, it says that Vyveva exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041) and encrypts traffic using XOR (T1573.001), communicates via Tor (T1573.002).

The question is about whether Vyveva divides files into 0x1000000 bytes or more during exfiltration. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of file chunking or dividing files into specific sizes. The report talks about compression with zlib but doesn't specify whether it splits large files into smaller chunks. It does mention that the backdoor executes 23 commands, including file upload, but again, no details on chunking.

I know that some malware does chunk large files to avoid detection or to handle transmission limits, but the report doesn't provide evidence of that. Since the report doesn't mention anything about dividing files into 0x1000000 bytes or more, I can't assume it does that. Therefore, it's unlikely that Vyveva performs such a step as part of the Exfiltration tactic based on the given information.

So, the answer should be No.

The CTI report details Vyveva's activities, including file compression with zlib during collection and exfiltration via Tor. However, it does not mention any process of dividing files into chunks of 0x1000000 bytes or more. Without explicit evidence, it's unlikely Vyveva includes this step.

Final Answer: B
