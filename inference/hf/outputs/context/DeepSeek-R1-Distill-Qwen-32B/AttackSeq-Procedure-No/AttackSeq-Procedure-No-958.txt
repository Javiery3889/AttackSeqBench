Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Lazarus Group, after using certain defense evasion techniques, would likely use nltest.exe to enumerate Active Directory trusts before moving laterally. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details an attack by the Lazarus Group on a pharmaceutical company. The attack involved several MITRE ATT&CK tactics, so I'll go through each one to understand the sequence of events.

Starting with Reconnaissance, the attackers used malicious documents with job offers. These documents had macros that activated on the victims' computers. They used system utilities like ipconfig, ping, and net.exe, as well as unknown PE files. They also used a backdoor called CommsCacher with an encrypted config file. The domain they connected to was forecareer[.]com, which was a fake site mimicking General Dynamics.

Initial Access was achieved through these malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email. The documents had specific names, and when opened, the macros executed malicious code.

Execution involved using system utilities and the CommsCacher backdoor. They also used the command line and a malicious function in SQLite DLL.

For Persistence, they created services with sc.exe and used local admin accounts. They also placed shortcuts in the startup folder.

Privilege Escalation was done by creating local admin accounts and manipulating processes and services.

Defense Evasion techniques included encrypting config files with VEST, hiding malware in C:\ProgramData, deleting malware samples, and using rundll32.exe to launch a DLL.

Lateral Movement was achieved using compromised legitimate privileged accounts and their own encryption for communication.

Command and Control used HTTP to connect to C2 servers disguised as legitimate domains.

Now, the question is about whether, after evading defenses (specifically encrypting config files and hiding malware), the group would use nltest.exe /domain_trusts to enumerate Active Directory trusts before moving laterally.

Looking at the report, under Lateral Movement, it says they used compromised legitimate privileged accounts. It doesn't explicitly mention using nltest.exe or enumerating domain trusts. However, in many APT attacks, especially those involving lateral movement, attackers often perform reconnaissance on the network, which can include enumerating domain trusts to understand the network structure better.

The report mentions that they used system utilities like ipconfig, ping, and net.exe during reconnaissance. While nltest.exe is another system utility used for AD-related tasks, it's not explicitly listed here. However, the fact that they used other system utilities suggests they might use similar ones for AD enumeration.

Moreover, the report states that they used legitimate tools and their own tools. Since nltest.exe is a legitimate tool, it's plausible they would use it for enumeration before moving laterally.

So, putting it together, even though the report doesn't explicitly mention nltest.exe, the context suggests that the group would likely use such tools for reconnaissance before lateral movement. Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

The Lazarus Group's attack involved using system utilities and legitimate tools, which suggests they would use nltest.exe for AD enumeration before lateral movement.
