Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether BlackSoul encrypts its C2 traffic using OpenSSL before communicating over RESTful Strapi with JSON. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that BlackSoul is a RAT delivered via a spear phishing email. The initial access is through a CAB archive, which then executes a loader. The loader retrieves two files: an executable and a DLL. The DLL, blacksoulLib, is responsible for gathering browser data from Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. It also decodes a C2 URL and a Cloudflare DoH URL, generates login info, and sends the data back to BlackSoul in JSON format.

Looking at the Defense Evasion section, BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques like XOR and Caesar ciphers, but it's noted that these are only applied to the main program, not third-party libraries. So, if they were using OpenSSL, which is a third-party library, the strings related to it wouldn't be obfuscated. But the report doesn't mention anything about OpenSSL being used or any encryption in the C2 traffic.

In the Collection section, it says BlackSoul can handle commands, download files, upload files, and update configuration files. It uses the C2 server for these operations, but the report doesn't specify whether the communication is encrypted. The Exfiltration section mentions data is exfiltrated over the C2 channel, but again, no details on encryption methods.

The question is about whether BlackSoul uses OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic before using RESTful Strapi with JSON. The answer choices are Yes or No. From the report, there's no explicit mention of OpenSSL or encryption in the C2 communication. The only encryption mentioned is in the obfuscation techniques used by the malware itself, not for network traffic.

So, based on the information given, it's unlikely that BlackSoul uses OpenSSL for encrypting C2 traffic. The report doesn't provide evidence of such behavior, and the focus is more on obfuscation within the malware rather than network encryption.

The CTI report does not mention the use of OpenSSL for encrypting C2 traffic. It details obfuscation techniques within the malware but not encryption in network communication. Therefore, it is unlikely that BlackSoul encrypts C2 traffic using OpenSSL.

Final Answer: B: No
