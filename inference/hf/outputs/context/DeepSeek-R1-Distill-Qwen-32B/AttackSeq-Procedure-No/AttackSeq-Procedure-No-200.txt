Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. It says that GreyEnergy uses two initial infection vectors: exploiting self-hosted web services and spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. Once they get in, they use GreyEnergy mini, which is a lightweight backdoor that doesn't need admin rights. Then, they map the network and collect passwords to get domain admin privileges. They use Nmap for network mapping and Mimikatz for credential extraction.

The question is asking if, after these steps, they use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I know that PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool used by IT admins to push software and updates across a network. However, it's also known that cybercriminals sometimes abuse such tools for malicious purposes because they can easily spread malware if they have the right access.

In the report, it's mentioned that GreyEnergy uses standard tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. These are well-known tools in the cybersecurity world, often used by attackers for reconnaissance and credential dumping. The report doesn't explicitly mention PDQ Deploy, but it does talk about moving laterally and deploying malware (AvosLocker) across the network once they have domain admin privileges.

So, after gaining domain admin access, the attackers would need a way to distribute their ransomware and other tools. Using PDQ Deploy makes sense because it's a legitimate tool that's already present in many organizations, allowing them to push malware without raising suspicion. Since the report doesn't list PDQ Deploy as one of their tools, but it's a common method for lateral movement, especially when they have admin privileges, it's plausible that they would use it.

Therefore, the answer is likely Yes.

The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a network with GreyEnergy mini and obtaining domain admin privileges using Nmap and Mimikatz, would likely use PDQ Deploy to distribute AvosLocker and tools. This is because PDQ Deploy is a common tool for lateral movement, especially when attackers have administrative access, allowing them to spread malware discreetly.

Final Answer: A: Yes
