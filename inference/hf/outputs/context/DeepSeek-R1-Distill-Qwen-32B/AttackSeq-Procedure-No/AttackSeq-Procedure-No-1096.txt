Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicStrand encodes its C2 traffic using an altered version of base64 before retrieving the final payload from update.bokts[.]com. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes CosmicStrand as a UEFI firmware rootkit used by a Chinese-speaking threat actor. It's designed for persistence and stealth, targeting specific motherboards. The rootkit modifies the CSMCORE DXE driver, redirecting its entry point to attacker-supplied code in the .reloc section. This happens during system startup, leading to the download and deployment of a malicious component in Windows. Additionally, it tries to disable PatchGuard to avoid detection.

The "Others" section mentions that CosmicStrand was discovered by GReAT and Qihoo360 in 2017. The infection process involves hooks in the boot manager and Windows kernel loader to deploy a kernel-level implant. It's used to control victim machines, possibly through user-mode components or other variants. Victims are in several countries, and there's a link to the MyKings botnet. Two C2 servers are identified, with activity showing intermittent exploitation.

Now, the question is about whether CosmicStrand encodes C2 traffic using an altered base64 before retrieving the payload from update.bokts[.]com. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to determine if the report provides any information about how C2 traffic is encoded. The report mentions that CosmicStrand is used to control victim machines, implying it communicates with C2 servers. However, it doesn't explicitly state the method of encoding used for this communication.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether it's "likely" that they use an altered base64. The report doesn't mention anything about encoding methods, so I can't confirm it. However, in many APT activities, threat actors often use custom or altered encoding to avoid detection. But without explicit evidence from the report, I can't assume this.

Wait, the report does mention that CosmicStrand is designed for stealth and persistence. Stealth often involves using encryption or encoding to hide traffic. But again, it's not specified whether it's base64 or another method. Since the question is about an "altered version of base64," and the report doesn't provide details on the encoding method, I can't say for certain.

But the question is asking if it's "likely." Given that many APTs do use such techniques, but without specific info, I might lean towards it being possible but not certain. However, the answer choices are binary: Yes or No. Since the report doesn't mention it, I can't confirm it's a fact. Therefore, the answer is likely No, because there's no evidence in the report to support that they use altered base64 encoding.

The CTI report describes CosmicStrand's methods but does not provide specific details about the encoding of C2 traffic. While it's common for APTs to use encoding for stealth, the absence of explicit information in the report means we cannot confirm the use of an altered base64. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
