Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke compresses the data it collects using a custom LZW algorithm before sending it via FTP. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that CosmicDuke is involved in several MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The question is about the Exfiltration phase, specifically whether it uses a custom LZW compression.

Looking at the Exfiltration section of the report: It says that CosmicDuke automatically uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP. The configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, which are embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1. LZNT-1 is a compression algorithm used by Windows, so it's not a custom LZW implementation.

The question asks about a custom LZW algorithm. The report doesn't mention LZW at all; instead, it refers to LZNT-1. So, the compression method used is LZNT-1, not LZW. Therefore, the answer should be No, because it's using a different compression algorithm, not a custom LZW.

Wait, but the report says the configuration is compressed using an algorithm "similar to LZNT-1." Does that mean it's a custom version? The question is about a custom LZW, not LZNT-1. Since LZW and LZNT-1 are different algorithms, even if it's a custom version, it's not LZW. So, the answer is No.

The CTI report indicates that CosmicDuke compresses its configuration data using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1, not a custom LZW implementation. Since the question specifically asks about LZW, the answer is no.

Final Answer: B: No
