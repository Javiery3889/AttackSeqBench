Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SideCopy APT captures mouse movements or performs API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details various tactics and techniques used by SideCopy APT. The question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) after initial access. Specifically, it's asking if they capture mouse movements or do API hooking before deploying njRAT.

From the report, under the "Execution" section, it mentions that SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins, including file enumerators, credential stealers, and keyloggers. They've developed multiple new RAT families and plugins. The njRAT is specifically mentioned as being used with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based plugins for exfiltration.

Now, the question is about whether they perform mouse movement capture or API hooking before deploying njRAT. I need to see if these techniques are part of their infection chain.

Looking at the "Initial Access" section, they use malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, RAR droppers, and MSI installers. The infection chain is described as convoluted, involving multiple steps to deliver payloads. The "Execution" section talks about deploying RATs and plugins, but it doesn't explicitly mention mouse movement capture or API hooking.

In the "Defense Evasion" section, they use decoy documents, mimicked processes, and cloned websites. No mention of mouse tracking or API hooking here either.

The "Others" section adds that they use phishing portals and have a focus on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach. Again, no specific mention of mouse movements or API hooking.

So, based on the report, the main techniques after initial access involve delivering RATs and using plugins for credential theft. There's no explicit information about capturing mouse movements or using API hooking as part of their process before deploying njRAT.

Therefore, it seems unlikely that SideCopy uses these specific techniques before deploying njRAT. Their focus is more on delivering malware through infection chains and using credential-stealing plugins rather than tracking mouse movements or hooking APIs.
</think>

The CTI report details SideCopy APT's tactics, focusing on initial access through malicious LNK files and subsequent deployment of RATs and plugins for credential harvesting. There is no mention of capturing mouse movements or performing API hooking as part of their infection process. Their methods primarily involve delivering malware and using credential-stealing tools, without evidence of the specified techniques.

Final Answer: B: No
