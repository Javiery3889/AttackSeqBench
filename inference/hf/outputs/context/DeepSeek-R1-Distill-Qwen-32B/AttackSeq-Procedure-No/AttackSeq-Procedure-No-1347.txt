Okay, so I need to figure out whether the callCam app will encrypt data using RSA and AES before collecting files and screenshots. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the callCam app is installed via dropper apps like Camero and FileCrypt Manager. These droppers download additional DEX files from a C&C server. The installation uses an overlay screen to hide it from the user, which is part of their defense evasion tactics.

Next, under the Execution section, it says that callCam hides its icon and runs in the background to collect sensitive info. So, once installed, it starts collecting data.

Then, under Collection, it states that callCam collects various data types, which are then encrypted with RSA and AES before being sent to the C&C server. Exfiltration details also mention encryption with these algorithms, along with SHA256 for integrity.

So, the sequence is: after evading detection during installation, the app collects data, encrypts it, and then exfiltrates. The question is whether encryption happens before collection. But according to the report, encryption occurs after collection. So the answer should be No, because the encryption is done after collecting the data, not before.

The callCam app collects data first and then encrypts it using RSA and AES before exfiltration. Therefore, encryption occurs after data collection.

Final Answer: B: No
