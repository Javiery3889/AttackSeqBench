Okay, so I need to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Word document only before gaining initial access. The question is asking if the VBS macros are the only method used for initial access in this campaign.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report mentions that the campaign uses phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros. When the user opens the document, a VBS macro executes. This macro retrieves and runs an encoded PowerShell script. The script then downloads and executes the payloads, which are Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

Looking at the attack sequence, the initial access is through the phishing email with the malicious Word document. The VBS macro is the first step in the execution phase. The macro runs the PowerShell script, which communicates with C2 servers to download the payloads. The payloads then cause the impact by encrypting files and harvesting credentials.

The question is specifically about whether the VBS macros are the only method used for initial access. The report doesn't mention any other methods besides the VBS macros in the Word document. It doesn't talk about other vectors like exploit kits, watering hole attacks, or other types of malware delivery. So, based on the information given, the initial access is solely through the VBS macros in the Word document.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the VBS macros are the only method used for initial access in this campaign.
</think>

The CTI report details that the campaign uses phishing emails with Word documents containing VBS macros as the initial access vector. No other methods are mentioned, indicating that the VBS macros are the sole means of gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
