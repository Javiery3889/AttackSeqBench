Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in the described CTI report would stop specific services related to backups before changing the victims' passwords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines two main tactics: Initial Access and Credential Access. Under Initial Access, the attackers used phishing methods to trick Instagram users into giving up their credentials. They impersonated support or friends, used messaging apps, and created fake phishing sites that looked like Instagram.

Then, under Credential Access, it says that after collecting the credentials, the attackers changed the account passwords, locking out the original owners. Additionally, they downloaded all images and messages, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

The question is asking if, after getting the credentials, the attackers would stop backup services before changing the passwords. The options are Yes or No.

So, I need to think about what the attackers did. They changed the passwords, which would lock out the original users. But they also downloaded data, possibly using the backup feature. If they used the backup feature, they might have accessed it before changing the password. If they stopped the backup service, they might prevent the original owner from restoring data after being locked out.

But the report doesn't explicitly say whether they stopped the backup services. It just mentions that they downloaded data, either manually or via the backup feature. So, if they used the backup feature, they might have done so before changing the password. If they didn't stop the backup, the original owner could potentially restore data after regaining access.

However, the question is about whether they would stop the backup services before changing the password. The report doesn't mention anything about disabling or stopping backup services. It only mentions that they downloaded data, possibly using the backup feature. So, there's no direct evidence that they stopped the backup services.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's not clear that they stopped the backup services. They might have used the backup to download data but didn't necessarily stop the service. So, the answer would likely be No, they probably didn't stop the backup services before changing the passwords.

The CTI report indicates that attackers used Instagram's data backup feature to download victims' data but does not mention them stopping backup services. Therefore, it's unlikely they stopped backups before changing passwords.

Final Answer: B: No
