Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Jupyter infostealer uses steganography for hiding its C2 communications, sending collected info, and undergoing version upgrades. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report describes the attack chain. It starts with an installer that evades detection, injects a .NET C2 client into memory, and uses PowerShell scripts. The execution part mentions using Process Hollowing to inject shellcode into legitimate apps like msinfo32.exe. It also uses a PowerShell intermediate loader that decrypts a base64 blob and runs another .NET assembly in-memory.

Looking at the question, it's asking if after these steps, the infostealer uses steganography for C2, exfiltration, and version upgrades. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, I don't see any mention of steganography. The report talks about defense evasion techniques like copying stolen data to another directory, obfuscation, and changing code structure. It also mentions using different C2 servers for the loader and the infostealer, but nothing about hiding communications via steganography.

Steganography is a method where data is hidden within other data, often used to hide communications. If the report doesn't mention it, it's unlikely they're using it. The report does talk about using different C2 servers, which is a common tactic, but that's different from steganography.

So, based on the information given, there's no indication that steganography is part of their TTPs. Therefore, the answer is probably No.

The Jupyter infostealer's tactics, as described, include evading detection through various methods but do not mention the use of steganography. The report details the use of different C2 servers and other evasion techniques but does not indicate that steganography is employed for hiding communications, exfiltration, or version upgrades. Therefore, it is unlikely that steganography is part of their tactics.

Final Answer: B: No
