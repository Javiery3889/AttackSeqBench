Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Korplug variant used by Mustang Panda is likely to perform data discovery on the system, like collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives. The question is based on a CTI report provided, so I need to go through that report carefully to find the relevant information.

First, I'll start by reading the report again to understand the attack sequence and the tactics used. The report mentions that the Korplug variant is part of a campaign by Mustang Panda, which targets various entities using phishing and watering hole attacks. The initial access vector uses filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document. 

The execution phase involves a custom loader that decrypts and executes the Korplug malware in memory. For persistence, the malware creates a hidden directory and sets up either a scheduled task or a registry entry to run at boot. 

Looking at the defense evasion tactics, the report states that the campaign uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. The Korplug file is encrypted and decrypted at runtime, and its configuration data is encrypted with XOR. The directories are hidden, and the malware can run commands on a hidden desktop.

Now, the discovery phase is where the malware collects information about the system. The report says that Korplug collects extensive system information, including uptime, Windows version, CPU details, RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time. This indicates that the malware is gathering detailed information about the compromised system.

Moving on to the collection phase, the report explicitly states that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It can list files and directories with their attributes and content, and it gathers metadata and content from all mapped drives. This directly answers the question about data discovery because it shows that the malware is designed to collect data from mapped drives.

The command and control section mentions that Korplug communicates using a custom TCP-based protocol, with encrypted messages using RC4. The data exfiltration is done over TCP, and the messages are both compressed and encrypted. This supports the idea that after establishing communication, the malware would send the collected data back to the attackers.

Putting this all together, the report clearly indicates that Korplug performs data discovery by collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it is likely to perform such activities.

The CTI report details that the Korplug variant collects data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, including metadata and content from all mapped drives. This confirms that data discovery is part of its functionality.

Final Answer: A
