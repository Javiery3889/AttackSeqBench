Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after using WMI for lateral movement and after they've already gained credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of FIN13. Let me go through each section to understand their attack sequence.

Reconnaissance: They target Mexico since 2017, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality. They map networks, capture credentials, and steal documents for fraudulent money transfers. They use custom passive backdoors and tools for long-term intrusions.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

Execution: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file transfer, and proxying. They also use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor with an HTTP server on high ports.

Persistence: They replace legitimate binaries like KeePass with trojanized versions to log passwords. They also use email for C2 with MAILSLOT.

Privilege Escalation: They use ProcDump to dump LSASS memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil for obfuscation and KeePass for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They use passive backdoors, chain web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon features.

Credential Access: They dump LSASS, network sniffing, target unsecured credentials, and use trojanized KeePass.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI for remote command execution, tools like Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

Collection: They collect data from network shares, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using specific tools.

Command and Control: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols. They transfer tools and encode data.

Exfiltration: They use web services, web shells, and JSP tools to exfiltrate data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is about whether after using WMI for lateral movement, they would leverage native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance, specifically after gaining credentials via LSASS dumping and network sniffing.

Looking at the report, under Privilege Escalation, they use ProcDump and Mimikatz, which are tools to extract credentials from LSASS. They also use network sniffing. So, they do gather credentials this way.

After lateral movement via WMI, what do they do? The report mentions that they collect data from network shares and stage it. They also use native tools like certutil for defense evasion, which suggests they do use native OS binaries.

In the Defense Evasion section, they use legitimate utilities like certutil, which is a native OS binary. They also use Mimikatz, which is a tool that can be used to gather credentials, but it's not a native binary. However, the report doesn't explicitly state whether they use native OS binaries for internal reconnaissance after gaining credentials.

But wait, in the Privilege Escalation section, they use ProcDump, which is a legitimate Microsoft utility. So they do use native OS binaries for privilege escalation. Additionally, in Defense Evasion, they use certutil, which is another native tool.

So, after gaining access and moving laterally, they would likely use these native tools to gather more information. Since they already have credentials, they might use native binaries to avoid detection, as using native tools can blend in better with normal network activity.

Therefore, the answer would be Yes, they are likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance after gaining credentials.

After analyzing the CTI report, it's evident that FIN13 employs native OS binaries like ProcDump and certutil for their operations. They use these tools for privilege escalation and defense evasion, which suggests they would also use them for internal reconnaissance after lateral movement. Since they already gather credentials via LSASS dumping and network sniffing, leveraging native tools for further information gathering aligns with their TTPs to maintain stealth.

Final Answer: A
