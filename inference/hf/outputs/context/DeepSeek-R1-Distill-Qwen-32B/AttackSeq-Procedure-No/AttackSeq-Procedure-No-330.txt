Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Derusbi will retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each part:

1. **Initial Access**: The adversary gained SSH access and used wget to download malware. The malware was compiled on the day it was downloaded, suggesting active development.

2. **Execution**: The custom loader executes Derusbi, which drops the Turbo LKM, loads it into the kernel, and then deletes it to avoid detection. The client uses Turbo to hide processes.

3. **Persistence**: Turbo LKM hides processes, making detection harder.

4. **Defense Evasion**: Derusbi and Turbo use cloaking and anti-analysis. Turbo modifies the system call table via the global call table, affecting PIDs, and disables CR0 write protection to hide processes.

5. **Command and Control**: The malware binds to a raw socket on a random port between 31800-31900, beacons to port 443 without SSL, and uses HTTP POST with obfuscated content.

Now, the question is about whether Derusbi retrieves metadata or lists the current directory before binding to the socket and communicating with C2.

Looking at the report, after execution, Derusbi uses Turbo to hide processes. Then, it's mentioned that the C2 communication uses a raw socket. The report doesn't explicitly state that Derusbi retrieves file metadata or lists the directory before this step.

In the execution phase, the focus is on dropping the LKM, loading it, and hiding processes. The persistence and defense evasion tactics are about hiding, not about gathering file information. The C2 section talks about binding to a socket and beaconing, but there's no mention of file operations before that.

So, the sequence seems to be: gain access, execute malware, use LKM to hide, then establish C2. There's no indication of file metadata retrieval or directory listing in the steps before C2 communication. Therefore, it's unlikely that Derusbi would perform those actions before binding to the socket.

The CTI report details the attack sequence, focusing on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control. After executing Derusbi and using Turbo LKM for evasion, the next step is establishing C2 communication. The report does not mention Derusbi retrieving file metadata or listing directories before this step. Therefore, it is unlikely that these actions occur before binding to the socket.

Final Answer: B: No
