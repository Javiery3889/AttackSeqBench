Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Flash file 'show.swf' in the described attack would likely downgrade NTLM to capture hashes before installing the payload. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The attack involved a spear-phishing campaign targeting the US Government using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit. The exploit was for CVE-2015-5119, which is a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The report mentions that the exploit was hosted on specific domains and that it retrieved a secondary payload, b.gif, from the same domains.

The execution part of the report explains that the Flash exploit, 'show.swf', used ActionScript to execute shellcode for installing a payload. It details the classes involved and mentions that the exploit created a use-after-free condition. It also notes similarities with a previous attack by the APT group UPS, which exploited CVE-2015-3113. The report points out that the shellcodes for these two CVEs were 99% similar, suggesting that the same group is likely behind both attacks.

The question is asking if, after the initial access via the Flash exploit, the 'show.swf' file would likely downgrade NTLM to capture hashes before the shellcode installs the payload. The options are Yes or No.

I need to determine if NTLM downgrade is part of the attack sequence. NTLM is a authentication protocol, and downgrading it typically refers to forcing the use of weaker versions (like NTLMv1) which are more vulnerable to attacks like pass-the-hash. This is often done to capture credentials.

Looking at the report, the main focus is on the Flash exploit and the shellcode execution. The report mentions that the exploit retrieves a secondary payload from a GIF image, which is then decrypted and executed. There's no explicit mention of NTLM downgrade or credential theft in the attack sequence described.

The report does talk about the payload extraction and decryption technique from the GIF, but it doesn't specify what the payload does beyond installing itself. The similarities with the previous attack (CVE-2015-3113) are noted, but again, there's no indication that NTLM downgrade was part of that attack either.

APT groups often use various techniques, including credential theft, but without specific evidence in the report, I can't assume that NTLM downgrade was used here. The report's focus is on the exploit and payload delivery, not on lateral movement or credential theft.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there's no indication that the 'show.swf' file would perform an NTLM downgrade. The attack sequence seems to focus on exploiting the Flash vulnerability to execute shellcode and install the payload, without mentioning any steps related to NTLM or credential capture.
</think>

The CTI report details a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Flash exploit to gain initial access and execute shellcode for payload installation. It does not mention any steps related to NTLM downgrade or credential theft. The focus is on the exploit and payload delivery, without evidence of NTLM-related activities.

Final Answer: B: No
