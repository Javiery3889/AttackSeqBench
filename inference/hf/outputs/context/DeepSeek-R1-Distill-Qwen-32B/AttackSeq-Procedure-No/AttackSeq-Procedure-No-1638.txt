Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the adversary in the CTI report would encrypt data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key before exfiltration. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the report outlines the MITRE ATT&CK tactics used by the adversary. The question is about the Exfiltration phase, specifically whether they'd use 3DES encryption with a hardcoded key.

Looking at the Exfiltration section of the report: It says the adversary uses the C2 channel for small data, like account details. For larger data, they compress, encrypt, and stage it, then exfiltrate using a custom tool to cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

The report mentions that the custom tool is used for exfiltration, but it doesn't specify the encryption method. However, in the Command and Control section, it notes that the adversary used Cobalt Strike's C2 with DNS and later HTTPS. Importantly, they used a cracked/patched trial version which doesn't support encryption in non-encrypted protocols like DNS. But when using HTTPS, the C2 traffic is encrypted.

Now, the question is about encryption during exfiltration. The report doesn't explicitly state that they use 3DES. Instead, it says they encrypt the data before exfiltration using their custom tool. The encryption method isn't specified, so we can't assume it's 3DES. 

3DES is an older encryption algorithm, and while it's possible, the report doesn't provide evidence of its use. The adversary's use of Cobalt Strike with HTTPS suggests they might prefer more modern encryption methods. Also, using a hardcoded key could be risky because if the key is discovered, all encrypted data is compromised. It's less common for sophisticated adversaries to use hardcoded keys, as they might prefer more secure or dynamic key management.

Therefore, based on the information given, there's no indication that 3DES with a hardcoded key was used. The report doesn't mention this specific method, so it's unlikely.

The CTI report does not specify the use of 3DES encryption with a hardcoded key during exfiltration. Instead, it mentions the use of a custom tool for encrypting large data, but the encryption method is not detailed. The adversary's use of HTTPS for C2 suggests a preference for modern encryption, and using a hardcoded key is less secure. Therefore, it's unlikely they used 3DES with a hardcoded key.

Final Answer: B: No
