Okay, so I need to figure out whether Grandoreiro is likely to restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer. The question is based on the provided CTI report, so I should start by carefully reading that report to extract the relevant information.

First, looking at the Initial Access section, Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates, and lately exploiting COVID-19 fears. That's about how it gets into the system, but not directly related to restarting in safe mode.

Next, the Persistence section says that Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. This allows it to maintain persistence across restarts. So, it's using a startup shortcut, which means it can run on boot without needing to restart the machine. This suggests that the malware doesn't necessarily need to force a restart because it can already ensure it runs every time the system starts.

Moving on to Privilege Escalation, Grandoreiro uses several methods to gain higher permissions, like hooking APIs, killing processes, and blocking DLLs. It also registers a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to execute with elevated privileges. This shows that it's focused on gaining higher access but doesn't mention anything about restarting the system.

In the Credential Access section, it steals credentials from Chrome and Outlook. Again, no mention of system restarts.

The Discovery section is more relevant. It says that Grandoreiro collects information about the victim, including computer name, username, OS version, bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed. It also lists installed security products. The question is about whether it would restart in safe mode before collecting this information.

The Command and Control section describes how it communicates with its C&C server using RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing handshakes and checking for commands. The first command is a list of connected victims with collected info. Still, nothing about restarting the system.

Looking at the Others section, it mentions that Grandoreiro is written in Delphi, uses a DGA for hiding C&C addresses, is modular with separate DLLs for banks, and uses large binaries with BMP images to bloat the size. It also uses a spam tool for distribution. None of this points to safe mode restarts.

Now, the question is about whether Grandoreiro would restart the machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting info. Safe mode is often used by malware to execute in a reduced environment where certain security products might not load, making it easier to collect information without interference.

But from the report, Grandoreiro already has methods to prevent security software from running. It hooks APIs to block DLLs, kill processes, and change file paths. It also uses privilege escalation techniques. These methods suggest that it's trying to disable security software without needing to reboot into safe mode. Safe mode is a more drastic measure and might be more noticeable to the user, which could increase the risk of detection.

Moreover, the persistence mechanism via the .LNK file in the startup directory means that the malware can run on every boot without needing to force a restart. If it were to restart the system, it might disrupt the user, which could lead to suspicion. Since the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent, it's more likely to use less intrusive methods to evade detection rather than forcing a restart into safe mode.

Additionally, the report doesn't mention any behavior related to system restarts or safe mode. All the evasion techniques described are in-process, like API hooking and process killing, which can be done without rebooting. Therefore, it's unlikely that Grandoreiro would restart the machine in safe mode as part of its initial information collection process.

So, putting it all together, the answer is probably "No," because Grandoreiro already has effective methods to evade detection without needing to restart the system, and forcing a restart could draw attention to its activities.
</think>

The analysis of the CTI report indicates that Grandoreiro employs various stealthy techniques to evade detection, such as API hooking, process killing, and persistence through a startup shortcut. These methods allow it to collect information without needing to restart the system, which could alert users. The report does not mention any behavior involving safe mode restarts, further supporting the conclusion that such a step is unnecessary for its operations.

Final Answer: B: No
