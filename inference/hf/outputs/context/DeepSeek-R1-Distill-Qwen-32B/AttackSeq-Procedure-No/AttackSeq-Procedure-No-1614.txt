Okay, so I need to figure out whether the collected email accounts from Microsoft Outlook MAPI are automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to find the relevant information.

First, the report mentions that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts. It then says that the collected data is sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request. So, the method used here is a POST request, which is typically associated with HTTP, not FTP.

Looking at the Command and Control section, the report lists the domains h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net. These domains are used for communication, but the report doesn't specify the protocol used. However, since the data is sent via a POST request, it's more likely using HTTP or HTTPS rather than FTP.

Additionally, the report doesn't mention anything about FTP being used for exfiltration. All the communication methods described are related to web-based requests, which align with HTTP/HTTPS rather than FTP.

So, putting it all together, the data is sent using a POST request, which is part of the HTTP protocol, not FTP. Therefore, the email accounts are not exfiltrated over FTP.

The CTI report indicates that the malware uses a POST web request to send collected data to the command and control servers, which is typically done via HTTP or HTTPS, not FTP. Therefore, the email accounts are not exfiltrated over FTP.

Final Answer: B: No
