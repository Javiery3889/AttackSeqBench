Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the APT-TOCS attack used PowerShell scripts to run a credential harvesting tool in memory after gaining initial access, instead of using Shellcode scripts. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that the initial access was done using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts. So, the initial step is clear: they used PowerShell to run Shellcode. The report also notes that a binary file, Sample A, was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe". That suggests that the initial execution involved PowerShell, but the scripts themselves were Shellcode.

Next, the report talks about defense evasion. It says that the attack ran in memory without writing to the hard disk and used multi-beacon communication to evade detection. This indicates that the attack was designed to stay in memory to avoid being caught by security software or sandboxes.

Now, the question is asking if, after initial access, they used PowerShell scripts to run a credential harvesting tool in memory instead of the Shellcode. So, I need to see if the report mentions anything about credential harvesting or if it's more about the Shellcode's functionality.

Looking at the report, the initial access uses Shellcode scripts for remote control. The defense evasion part talks about running in memory, but it doesn't specify whether it's the Shellcode or PowerShell scripts doing that. The lateral movement and command and control sections mention using encrypted scripts and HTTP GET requests, but again, no mention of credential harvesting.

The "Others" section says that APT-TOCS is related to Cobalt Strike, which is known for its post-exploitation tools, including credential harvesting. But the report doesn't explicitly state that they used such tools in this attack.

So, the question is whether the core step involved using PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting in memory. The report doesn't mention credential harvesting at all. It does mention that the attack used Shellcode scripts for remote control and that the defense evasion involved running in memory. But it doesn't specify that they used PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting instead of the Shellcode.

Therefore, based on the information given, the attack used Shellcode scripts for initial access and remote control, and the defense evasion involved running in memory. There's no indication that they switched to using PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting. So, the answer would be that it's not likely they used PowerShell scripts for that purpose; instead, the Shellcode was executed in memory as part of the initial access and evasion tactics.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that APT-TOCS used PowerShell to execute Shellcode scripts for initial access and remote control. The defense evasion tactics involved running in memory, but the report does not mention the use of PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting. Instead, the focus was on Shellcode execution. Therefore, it is unlikely that PowerShell scripts were used for credential harvesting in memory.

Final Answer: B: No
