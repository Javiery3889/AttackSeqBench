Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attack described in the CTI report is likely to involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files before downloading the Crimson RAT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report. The report mentions that the attack used a malicious document with macro code. The macro executed to drop a payload, which then downloaded the Crimson RAT from a specific IP address. The report also notes that in a previous campaign, a similar document named 'MoFA-MoDAfghanistan.xls' was used, which had a malicious macro that downloaded a payload from a URL. Additionally, Proofpoint's report on 'Operation Transparent Tribe' details attacks using Crimson RAT against Indian Embassies, with one campaign using the same URL as the second campaign.

Now, the question is asking if social media channels were used to deliver malicious files before downloading the RAT. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, the delivery method mentioned is a malicious document, specifically an Excel file. There's no mention of social media being used in either the current attack or the previous campaigns. The report talks about spear phishing campaigns, but the delivery vector is through documents, not social media platforms.

So, the attack sequence starts with a malicious document via spear phishing, which then drops the payload. There's no indication that social media was part of the delivery process. The report doesn't mention any social media channels being used to distribute the malicious files. Instead, it focuses on the use of documents with macros.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not indicated that social media was used. The delivery method was through a malicious document, likely sent via email as part of a spear phishing campaign. Without evidence of social media involvement, the answer would be No.

The CTI report details the use of a malicious document with macros as the delivery method, without mentioning social media. Therefore, it's unlikely that social media was used in this attack.

Final Answer: B: No
