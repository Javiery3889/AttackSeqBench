Okay, so I need to figure out whether BRONZE PRESIDENT uses the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after using scripts to collect files during the Collection phase. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the Collection phase, BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations. That's clear. Now, the question is about what they do nextâ€”specifically, whether they use FTP for C2.

Looking at the Exfiltration section, it says they use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data. These tools are typically used for C2 communication. Cobalt Strike, for example, is known for its Beacon payload, which communicates over HTTP or HTTPS, not FTP. Similarly, RCSession is a remote control tool that uses various protocols, but I don't recall FTP being one of them.

The report also mentions that they use custom scripts to create lists of files for exfiltration. But the method of exfiltration isn't specified beyond the tools mentioned. Since FTP is an older protocol and less secure compared to HTTP-based methods, which are more common in modern C2, it's unlikely they'd use FTP. Additionally, the report doesn't mention FTP anywhere, which is a red flag. If they were using it, it might have been noted, especially since FTP is not as stealthy.

Moreover, the group uses tools like Cobalt Strike, which are designed for more sophisticated and stealthy C2. They also take steps to avoid detection, like deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes. Using FTP, which is less secure and more easily detectable, would contradict their efforts to remain undetected.

So, putting it all together, the tools they use for exfiltration don't align with FTP. They're more likely using HTTP-based or other encrypted protocols for C2. Therefore, the answer is probably No.

The CTI report indicates that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike for exfiltration, which typically employ HTTP or HTTPS rather than FTP. Additionally, the group's focus on stealth and avoiding detection suggests they would avoid using FTP, a less secure and more detectable protocol. Therefore, it is unlikely they use FTP for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B: No
