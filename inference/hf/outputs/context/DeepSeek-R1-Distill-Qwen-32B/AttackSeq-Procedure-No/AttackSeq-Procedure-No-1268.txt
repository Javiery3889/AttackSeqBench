Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in the CTI report are likely to enumerate AWS infrastructure, like EC2 instances, after using SocGholish. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the report describes the attack sequence. The attackers used SocGholish, a JavaScript framework, to deliver malicious files. They disguised it as a software update, which led to executing more scripts and eventually deploying Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike was used for various activities, including credential dumping, lateral movement, and command and control.

The question is about whether they would enumerate AWS infrastructure. The answer choices are Yes or No. I need to see if the report mentions anything about AWS or cloud infrastructure.

Looking through the report, I don't see any mention of AWS, EC2, or any cloud services. The attack seems focused on compromising on-premises systems. They used tools like wmic.exe, PsExec, and Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the network. The impact was on encrypting computers and servers, which are likely on the local network.

The report also mentions that the attackers targeted major U.S. corporations, but it doesn't specify if these companies were using AWS. Since the report doesn't provide evidence of AWS enumeration, it's not clear that the attackers would do that. The TTPs listed don't include cloud-specific activities.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's not indicated that the attackers would enumerate AWS infrastructure. The attack sequence doesn't show any steps related to cloud services.

The CTI report details an attack sequence that focuses on compromising on-premises systems using tools like Cobalt Strike and SocGholish. There is no mention of AWS or cloud infrastructure in the report. The attackers' activities, such as lateral movement and credential access, are centered around local network systems. Without evidence of cloud-specific tactics, it's unlikely they enumerated AWS infrastructure.

Final Answer: B: No
