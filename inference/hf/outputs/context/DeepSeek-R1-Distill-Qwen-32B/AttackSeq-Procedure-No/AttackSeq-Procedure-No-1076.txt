Okay, so I need to figure out whether Tropic Trooper used various social media channels for spearphishing before dropping the backdoor installer. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware. These documents are designed to look like job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations, which suggests they're targeting specific individuals. The MSI file, which is part of the attack, drops some files and creates a hidden directory. The backdoor installer, UserInstall.exe, is dropped and then deletes itself. 

The report also talks about the attack sequence: the system configuration file drops UserInstall.exe, which then uses BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe. The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking to inject a backdoor into dllhost.exe. The persistence mechanism involves decrypting a configuration file and using SSL to connect to C&C servers. 

Looking at the "Others" section, it says that the documents are used to deliver the malware, but there's no mention of social media channels being used for spearphishing. The attack seems to rely on these malicious Office documents, possibly sent via email or other means, but the report doesn't specify social media as a vector.

The question is asking if social media was used for spearphishing before the backdoor installer was dropped. The answer choices are Yes or No. Since the report doesn't mention social media channels being used, I don't have evidence to support that. The delivery method is through Office documents, which could be sent via email or other means, but not necessarily social media.

Therefore, it's unlikely that social media was used in this specific attack sequence as described in the report.

The CTI report details Tropic Trooper's use of exploit-laden Office documents to deliver malware, targeting specific individuals with job vacancy-themed content. It does not mention the use of social media channels for spearphishing. The attack sequence focuses on document-based delivery, without evidence of social media involvement.

Final Answer: B: No
