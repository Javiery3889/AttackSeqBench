Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers conducted internal spearphishing attacks during their lateral movement phase. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what happened.

First, the report mentions that the initial access was gained through phishing emails to employees, which created backdoors. They also used social engineering for backdoor access. So, the initial access phase involved phishing and social engineering.

Next, in the execution phase, they deployed 'Mipko' on the Terminal Server, which captured keystrokes and screen captures. This tool was used to monitor users accessing the card management application.

Then, in privilege escalation, they exploited weaknesses in the Windows network, moved laterally, and compromised the Enterprise Admin account. They used tools like PSExec and plink.exe for lateral movement, which are legitimate tools, so that's part of their defense evasion tactics.

The defense evasion section also mentions using 'living off the land' tactics, which includes using legitimate commands and tools. They used Cobalt Strike Beacon for backdoors, which is a tool often used in attacks for persistence and command and control.

In the credential access phase, they targeted employee accounts with access to card management and used those credentials to manipulate cards. So, they were able to get credentials, possibly through the monitoring tool 'Mipko' which captured keystrokes and screen captures.

The command and control phase involved coordinating ATM withdrawals with physical mules across multiple locations. They planned the locations based on security and cash availability.

Now, the question is whether they conducted internal spearphishing attacks during lateral movement. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, during initial access, they used phishing emails. But during lateral movement, they used tools like PSExec and plink.exe, which are more about moving laterally using legitimate tools rather than phishing. There's no mention of them sending more phishing emails internally. They already had backdoors and used legitimate tools to move around.

So, the report doesn't indicate that they did internal spearphishing. Instead, they used existing access and tools to escalate privileges and move laterally. Therefore, it's unlikely they conducted internal spearphishing attacks during lateral movement.

The CTI report indicates that the attackers used phishing and social engineering for initial access but relied on legitimate tools and lateral movement techniques during privilege escalation. There is no evidence of internal spearphishing during lateral movement. 

Final Answer: B: No
