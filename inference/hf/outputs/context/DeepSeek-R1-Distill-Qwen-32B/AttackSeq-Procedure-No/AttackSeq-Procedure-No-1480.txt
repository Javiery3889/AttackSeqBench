Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Seaduke calculates the command-and-control port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the Duke group's activities using Seaduke malware. It mentions that Seaduke is a low-profile information-stealing Trojan that hides behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation. The communication protocol uses many layers of encryption and obfuscation, and it's connected to over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.

The question is about whether Seaduke calculates the C2 port using a specific method involving the IP address octets. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, I know that Seaduke uses encryption and obfuscation in its communication. It's designed to hide its activities, which suggests that the C2 communication might involve some level of complexity or obfuscation in how it connects. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention anything about how the port is calculated. It just states that there are multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation, and that it uses many compromised servers.

The question is asking if Seaduke calculates the port by multiplying the first two octets and adding the third. That's a specific method, and I don't recall any mention of such a technique in the report. The report talks about encryption and using many servers but doesn't go into the specifics of port calculation.

So, considering that the report doesn't provide any information about how the port is determined, and given that the method described in the question is a specific calculation, I don't have evidence to support that Seaduke uses this method. It's possible that the malware uses a different method, perhaps a static port or another obfuscation technique, but without explicit information, I can't confirm the method described.

Therefore, the answer is likely No because the report doesn't indicate that Seaduke uses such a calculation for the C2 port.
</think>

The CTI report describes Seaduke's use of encryption and obfuscation in communication but does not mention any specific method for calculating the command-and-control port. The question's proposed method of multiplying the first two octets and adding the third is not supported by the report. Therefore, it is unlikely that Seaduke uses this method.

Final Answer: B: No
