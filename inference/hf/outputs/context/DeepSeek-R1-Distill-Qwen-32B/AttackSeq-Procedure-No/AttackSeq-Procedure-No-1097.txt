Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP, specifically after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report outlines the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each section:

1. **Initial Access**: The report says that CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits, like a malicious Flash object in a PDF exploiting a known vulnerability. So, the initial infection vector is through a PDF or an executable disguised as a document or image.

2. **Execution**: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, with specific compilation dates. This part is more about how the malware runs once it's on the system.

3. **Persistence**: It creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence. The service starts the malware using a duplicated token, which is a common persistence technique.

4. **Credential Access**: This is where it gets interesting. The report states that CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, and others. It also steals Windows credentials like LM and NT hashes, cached passwords, LSA secrets, and WLAN keys. Additionally, it exports certificates and private keys, encrypting them with a specific password.

5. **Discovery**: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives, looking for specific patterns, including document and archive files. It also targets non-English filenames, particularly those with 'sifr' and 'sifer', which relate to encryption ciphers.

6. **Command and Control**: Communication is via HTTP GET, FTP, and WebDav. The configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, compressed with an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

7. **Exfiltration**: Data is uploaded to remote servers via FTP, with details on login credentials and folder structures. The report mentions that most sites were live at the time.

Now, the question is about whether, after exfiltration via FTP, CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.

Looking at the report, under **Credential Access**, it mentions stealing credentials from various software, which could imply the use of keyloggers or other credential theft methods. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It does talk about stealing credentials from applications, which might be done through memory scraping or other methods, but not necessarily through a keylogger.

In the **Discovery** section, it says CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, including specific patterns and non-English filenames. It doesn't mention searching removable drives or skipping certain file types. The exfiltration part talks about FTP but doesn't specify the order of operations after exfiltration.

The question is asking if, after exfiltration, CosmicDuke uses these additional TTPs (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) after searching removable drives and skipping file types. The report doesn't provide information about the malware using keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It focuses on credential theft from specific applications and file searching.

Moreover, the report doesn't mention anything about the malware searching removable drives or skipping file types during collection. The discovery phase is about searching hard and network drives, not removable ones. So, the behavior described in the question isn't supported by the CTI report.

Therefore, based on the information given, the answer would be that CosmicDuke is not likely to use those specific TTPs after exfiltration as described in the question.
</think>

The CTI report details CosmicDuke's activities, including credential theft from various applications and file searching on hard and network drives. However, it does not mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. Additionally, the report does not indicate that CosmicDuke searches removable drives or skips certain file types. Therefore, the described behavior in the question is not supported by the report.

Final Answer: B: No
