Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that FamousSparrow engaged in Resource Development by exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. These are all internet-facing applications, which makes sense because they're commonly used and often exposed to the internet. The group used these vulnerabilities to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure like domains and servers.

Next, under Initial Access, it's stated that they exploited the same remote code execution vulnerabilities in those applications to gain access. So, the initial step was exploiting these vulnerabilities to get into the systems.

Then, for Execution, they used cmd.exe to run commands that downloaded and installed SparrowDoor. So, after gaining initial access, they executed the backdoor using command-line tools.

The question is asking if SparrowDoor exploited those remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access. From the report, it's clear that the initial access was through exploiting those vulnerabilities, and then SparrowDoor was used for execution and other activities. So, SparrowDoor itself wasn't the initial exploit but was used after gaining access.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "After running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor for Execution and communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control, is it likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access?"

Hmm, so the question is whether SparrowDoor was the one that exploited the vulnerabilities for Initial Access. But according to the report, the initial access was done by exploiting the vulnerabilities, and then SparrowDoor was installed afterward. So SparrowDoor wasn't the exploit itself but the backdoor used after initial access.

Therefore, the answer would be No, because SparrowDoor was used for Execution and Command and Control, not for the Initial Access. The initial access was done through the vulnerabilities, but SparrowDoor itself wasn't the exploit.
</think>

The CTI report indicates that FamousSparrow exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. SparrowDoor was used later for Execution and Command and Control, not for the initial exploitation. Therefore, SparrowDoor did not exploit these vulnerabilities for Initial Access.

Final Answer: B: No
