Okay, so I need to figure out whether CosmicDuke enumerates Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations before using its keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The initial access is through a PDF exploit or a disguised executable. Then, execution uses a loader similar to MiniDuke. Persistence is achieved by creating a scheduled task and a Windows service named 'javamtsup'. 

Next, the report talks about credential access, where CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, and others. It also steals Windows credentials like LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and WLAN keys. Additionally, it exports certificates with a specific password.

Then, the collection phase involves a keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer, and searching removable drives. The command and control communication uses HTTP GET, FTP, and WebDav. Exfiltration is done via FTP.

The question is about whether, after persistence, CosmicDuke enumerates Azure AD users before collecting info. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of Azure AD enumeration. The credential access part lists several applications and Windows credentials but doesn't mention Azure AD. The collection phase includes keylogging, screenshots, clipboard, and removable drives, but nothing about enumerating Azure AD users.

So, based on the provided information, there's no indication that CosmicDuke performs Azure AD user enumeration. Therefore, it's unlikely.
</think>

The CTI report does not mention any activities related to Azure AD user enumeration. CosmicDuke's credential access focuses on stealing credentials from various software and Windows systems but does not include Azure AD enumeration. Therefore, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke enumerates Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations.

Final Answer: B: No
