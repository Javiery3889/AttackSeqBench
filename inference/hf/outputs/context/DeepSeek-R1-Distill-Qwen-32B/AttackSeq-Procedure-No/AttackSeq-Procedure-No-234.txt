Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in the CTI report establishes persistence using Microsoft Outlook add-ins or creates a scheduled task. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the report describes the attack starting with an initial access vector via a .lnk file in a zip attachment. The .lnk file is designed to look like a document, which is a common social engineering tactic. When executed, it runs some obfuscated MS-DOS code that carves out a PowerShell script. This script then executes another PowerShell script in memory, which uses a WScript Shell to create three files: a decoy DOC, a legitimate tool (InstallUtil.exe), and a .NET DLL with the payload.

The execution part mentions that the DLL is installed using InstallUtil.exe with the '/u' command, which is a bit tricky because it's supposed to uninstall but actually installs the malware. This is a defense evasion technique to bypass Smartscreen and AppLocker. The payload is a Cobalt Strike beacon, which communicates with a C2 server.

Now, the question is about persistence. The options are whether the malware uses Outlook add-ins or creates a scheduled task. From the report, I don't see any mention of Outlook add-ins being used. The persistence method here seems to be through the use of InstallUtil.exe, which is a legitimate tool, to install the DLL as a service. This method allows the malware to persist across reboots because services typically start automatically.

Scheduled tasks are another common persistence method, but the report doesn't mention creating any. Instead, it's using a service installation, which is a different approach. Since the report doesn't indicate the use of Outlook add-ins or scheduled tasks, but rather a service-based persistence, the answer would likely be that it doesn't use Outlook add-ins. Therefore, the answer is B: No.

The CTI report details the malware's use of InstallUtil.exe to install a DLL as a service, enabling persistence without mentioning Outlook add-ins or scheduled tasks. Thus, the malware does not establish persistence via Outlook add-ins.

Final Answer: B: No
