Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher after ensuring persistence with the Milestone backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details an attack by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, using the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers. They deployed a backdoor called Milestone, which is based on Gh0st RAT and packed with Themida. The backdoor copies itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creates a service named msupdate2 in the registry for persistence.

The question is about whether, after establishing persistence, Deep Panda would install a self-generated certificate as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, I know that Deep Panda used a stolen digital certificate, which was also used by another group, Winnti. This suggests that they are using legitimate or stolen certificates to sign their tools, possibly to avoid detection. However, the report doesn't mention anything about installing self-generated certificates into the local trust store. Instead, it talks about using a stolen certificate, which is different from creating and installing their own.

APT groups often use stolen certificates to make their malware appear legitimate. Installing a self-generated certificate as a root CA would be a more advanced step, allowing them to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or sign their own code as trusted. But the report doesn't provide evidence of this happening in this specific campaign. It only mentions the use of a stolen certificate, not self-generated ones.

Additionally, the question is about whether they are likely to do this before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture. The report states that the Milestone backdoor does have capabilities for system information discovery and screen capture, but there's no mention of certificate installation in the attack sequence. The persistence mechanism involves copying the DLL and creating a service, but nothing about certificates.

So, considering the information given, the report doesn't indicate that Deep Panda installed a self-generated certificate. They used a stolen one, which is a different tactic. Therefore, it's unlikely that they installed their own certificate in this case.

The CTI report indicates that Deep Panda used a stolen digital certificate, not a self-generated one, to sign their tools. There is no mention of installing a self-generated certificate as a root CA or Trusted Publisher. The persistence mechanism involved copying the DLL and creating a service, but no certificate installation was noted. Therefore, it's unlikely they installed their own certificate.

Final Answer: B: No
