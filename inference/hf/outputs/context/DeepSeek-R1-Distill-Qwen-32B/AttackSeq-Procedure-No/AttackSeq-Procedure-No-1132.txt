Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sakula malware is likely to use steganography to hide its C2 communications with specific domains after exploiting CVE-2015-5119. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that the attack started with an exploit using CVE-2015-5119, which was hosted on a spoofed website. The exploit led to the execution of a first-stage downloader, Rdws.exe, which then wrote another file, adobe.dat. This downloader retrieved a second-stage PlugX file that connected to C2 domains starting with cdn.sanecat.com. The first-stage downloader was identified as a new variant of Sakula malware.

The "Others" section adds context that Sakula has been used in several campaigns, including "French Aerospace" and "Ironman." It's noted that Sakula and PlugX have shared the same C2 infrastructure, suggesting a connection between the two. The report also mentions that Sakula is a limited-release tool, possibly used by well-resourced adversaries.

Now, the question is asking if Sakula will use steganography to hide C2 communications with domains like inocnation.com or oa.ameteksen.com. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to determine if steganography is a technique Sakula is known to use. From the report, I don't see any mention of steganography. The report talks about the use of exploit code, downloaders, PlugX, and C2 domains, but there's no indication that Sakula employs steganography for communication.

Steganography is a method where data is hidden within other data, often used to obscure communications. If Sakula used it, the report would likely mention it as a technique, especially since it's a significant method for hiding C2 traffic. Since it's not mentioned, it's probably not part of Sakula's TTPs in this context.

Additionally, the report links Sakula with PlugX, which might have its own C2 methods, but again, steganography isn't mentioned. The C2 domains are directly connected, so there's no need for additional hiding techniques unless specified.

Therefore, based on the information given, Sakula doesn't seem to use steganography for its C2 communications. The answer is likely No.
</think>

The CTI report details an attack involving Sakula malware, which uses a first-stage downloader to retrieve PlugX and connects to specific C2 domains. There is no mention of steganography in the report, suggesting it's not part of Sakula's tactics. Therefore, it's unlikely Sakula uses steganography for C2 communications.

Final Answer: B: No
