Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the FHAPPI campaign's malware would install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the FHAPPI campaign, which is an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) campaign. The initial access vector was a phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. The email's contents are sensitive, so they're not disclosed. The malware was a VBScript encoded script hosted under the account 'vbiayay1'. When executed, this script downloaded a .doc file and opened it, leading to a PowerShell attack that infected the system with Poison Ivy.

Next, the report mentions defense evasion tactics. The campaign used multiple encodings and wraps, including multilayered base64 encoding, to avoid detection. The attack was fileless, meaning it didn't rely on traditional executable files, which helps avoid known signatures. Additionally, the attack didn't originate from the attacker's territory, which probably made it harder to trace and increased the chances of success.

For command and control (C2), the malware communicated with a server at IP 61.97.243.15, which is a dial-up IP in South Korea. The domain used was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to someone in China, with WHOIS info showing 'Liu Ying' as the contact.

In the 'Others' section, it's noted that the campaign was first recognized in Japan and named FHAPPI. It used Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with modified PowerSploit PoC code. The main payload was Poison Ivy, which was injected into the 'userinit.exe' process. The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian. The malware's actions included extracting victim info, communicating back to the C2 server, and other malicious activities. The campaign was linked to a larger APT and used specific email addresses for phishing. The YIRD, JP-CERT/CC, and others helped delete the malware files.

Now, the question is about whether the malware would install itself as a cron job using cron instead of using PowerShell. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Let me think about the attack sequence. The initial access was via a phishing email with a link to a VBScript. The VBScript downloaded a .doc file, which then executed a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy. So, the execution chain is VBScript -> .doc file -> PowerShell -> Poison Ivy.

Cron jobs are typically used in Unix-based systems (like Linux) to schedule tasks. However, the report doesn't specify the target operating system. But given that the malware used VBScript and PowerShell, which are primarily Windows-based tools, it's likely that the targets were Windows systems.

In Windows, cron isn't the standard scheduling tool. Instead, Windows uses Task Scheduler. So, if the malware were to install itself for persistence, it would more likely use Task Scheduler rather than cron. The report mentions that the attack was fileless, which suggests that the malware didn't create a traditional executable file but instead used in-memory execution, possibly through scripts or other means.

Moreover, the report doesn't mention anything about cron or Unix-based systems. The C2 server is in South Korea, but the campaign was recognized in Japan and targeted Mongolian users, which doesn't necessarily indicate the OS used by the victims.

Given that the malware used PowerShell, which is a Windows-specific tool, it's more plausible that any persistence mechanism would also be Windows-based. Therefore, using cron is unlikely because it's not the typical method on Windows systems.

So, putting it all together, the malware is designed for Windows, uses PowerShell, and doesn't indicate any use of cron. Therefore, it's unlikely that it would install itself as a cron job.
</think>

The FHAPPI campaign utilized a phishing email to deliver a VBScript, which executed a PowerShell attack to install Poison Ivy on Windows systems. Since the attack targeted Windows, it would use Task Scheduler for persistence rather than cron, which is Unix-based. The report doesn't mention cron or Unix systems, further supporting that cron wasn't used.

Final Answer: B: No
