Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor used blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure after performing process and system information discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the CostaRicto Campaign, which uses the SombRAT backdoor. The report mentions several MITRE ATT&CK tactics, so I'll go through each one to understand the attack sequence.

Starting with Initial Access, the attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools to set up remote tunnels. They used private keys for authentication and scheduled tasks to execute payload stagers, which downloaded the backdoor. So, the initial access phase is about gaining entry into the victim's network.

Next, in the Execution phase, the backdoor is deployed using scripts and encrypted files. The 64-bit version uses a PowerShell loader, specifically the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection module, to inject the payload into memory. The 32-bit version uses a custom loader called CostaBricks, which decodes and injects the payload. This tells me that the execution is done through reflective injection, which is a common technique to avoid writing files to disk, thus evading detection.

Moving on to Defense Evasion, the report mentions that the campaign used process injection via the same PowerShell module and deobfuscation techniques. This reinforces the idea that the attackers are trying to hide their activities from detection tools.

In the Discovery phase, the SombRAT backdoor has capabilities for process discovery, system information, and system time. They also used tools like pscan and nmap for network scanning. So, after gaining access, the backdoor gathers information about the compromised system and the network.

The Collection phase involves the backdoor archiving data using a custom storage format. This means the attackers are collecting specific information they need, possibly sensitive data or credentials.

Exfiltration is the next step, where the collected data is sent out over the C2 channel. The report doesn't specify the exact method of exfiltration, just that it's done over the Command and Control channel.

Now, the question is asking whether, after the Discovery phase, the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure. The answer choices are Yes or No.

I need to evaluate if the report indicates that the C2 infrastructure involved blogs or WordPress. From the report, the Exfiltration section only mentions that data is exfiltrated over the C2 channel but doesn't specify the method or infrastructure used. The Initial Access phase talks about using SSH tunnels and proxy servers, but that's for initial access, not necessarily the C2.

I don't see any mention of blogs, WordPress, or any specific C2 infrastructure details in the report. The report focuses more on the techniques used for initial access, execution, evasion, discovery, collection, and exfiltration, but not on the specifics of how the C2 is set up.

Given that the report doesn't provide information about the C2 infrastructure being blogs or WordPress, I can't assume that. The question is asking if it's likely, but without evidence in the report, it's speculative. Therefore, the answer would be No, it's not likely based on the information provided.

The CTI report details the CostaRicto Campaign's tactics, including the use of SombRAT backdoor for discovery and exfiltration. However, it does not mention the use of blogs or WordPress for C2 infrastructure. Since there's no evidence in the report supporting this, it's unlikely.

Final Answer: B: No
