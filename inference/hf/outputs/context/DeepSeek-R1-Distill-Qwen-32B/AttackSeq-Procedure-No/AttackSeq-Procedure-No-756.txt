Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant used blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after performing initial reconnaissance. Let me go through the CTI report step by step to see what information I can gather.

First, the report mentions that the Rising Sun implant was part of Operation Sharpshooter. The attack started with a malicious document that had a macro, which injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word. This downloader then retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server. So, the initial access was through a macro in a Word document, which is a common method.

Looking at the Execution section, the shellcode from the macro used functions like LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress to resolve libraries and APIs. It downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document. The payloads were executed using CreateProcessA and ShellExecuteA. So, the execution phase involved downloading the implant and executing it.

In the Persistence section, it says that the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. This means that every time the user starts their computer, the implant runs again, ensuring it stays active.

The Discovery phase is where the implant gathered information. It fetched network adapter info, computer name, username, IP address, system info, and OS details. It also decrypted additional information, though not all was used. So, the implant was definitely doing some reconnaissance to understand the environment it's in.

Exfiltration is the next step. The report states that the Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and then Base64 encoded it before sending it via HTTP POST requests to the control server. This tells me that the communication method was over HTTP, likely using standard web requests, not something like blogs or WordPress.

Now, the question is about whether the implant used blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after the initial reconnaissance. The report doesn't mention anything about blogs or WordPress being used as C2 channels. Instead, it specifically says that data was exfiltrated using HTTP POST requests. This suggests that the command and control communication was done through standard web traffic, not through alternative methods like blogs or WordPress.

Additionally, the "Others" section mentions that the implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering info, reading/writing files, etc. But again, there's no indication that it used blogs or WordPress for communication. The communication method is clearly stated as HTTP POST, which is a common method for C2 but doesn't involve blogs or WordPress.

So, putting it all together, the report doesn't support the idea that blogs or WordPress were used for C2. Instead, it uses HTTP POST, which is a more direct and common method. Therefore, the answer is likely "No."

The Rising Sun implant communicated with its control server using HTTP POST requests, as detailed in the Exfiltration section of the report. There is no mention of blogs or WordPress being used for bidirectional communication. Instead, the communication method was standard web traffic, indicating that the answer is "No."

Final Answer: B
