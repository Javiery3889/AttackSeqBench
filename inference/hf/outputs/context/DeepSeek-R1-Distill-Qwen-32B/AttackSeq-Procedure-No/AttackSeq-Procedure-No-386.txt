Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT15 used valid account information, like VPN credentials, to remotely access the victim networks instead of deploying backdoors. The question is asking if, after they obtained the credentials and the VPN certificate, they likely used those valid accounts instead of their backdoors.

First, I'll look at the CTI report to understand the attack sequence. The report mentions several tactics and techniques used by APT15. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Execution**: They deployed three backdoorsâ€”BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI specifically bypasses command prompt restrictions by copying and patching cmd.exe. RoyalDNS uses DNS for command and control, which is different from the others that use HTTP.

2. **Persistence**: RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the network. So, once it's deployed, it stays active.

3. **Privilege Escalation**: They used Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials. This would give them higher-level access within the network.

4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI evades command prompt restrictions, which means it's designed to avoid detection by certain security policies.

5. **Credential Access**: They used Mimikatz again to steal domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. This suggests they have the means to access the network remotely using legitimate credentials.

6. **Collection**: They used tools like CSVDE, BCP, and bespoke tools to extract data from various systems.

Now, the question is about whether they used the stolen VPN credentials instead of their backdoors. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, it says they deployed backdoors as part of their execution phase. These backdoors are used for persistence and command and control. Even though they stole VPN credentials, the report doesn't explicitly state that they stopped using the backdoors. In fact, the backdoors are mentioned as part of their initial attack vector and persistence mechanism.

So, the fact that they have VPN credentials might mean they could access the network without the backdoors, but the report indicates they continued to use the backdoors for ongoing access. The backdoors provide a more reliable and persistent way to maintain access, especially since RoyalDNS uses DNS, which is harder to block than HTTP. Additionally, using backdoors allows them to stay in the network even if the VPN credentials are changed or detected.

Therefore, it's unlikely that they relied solely on the VPN credentials. They probably used both methods, but the backdoors were part of their strategy for persistence and control. So, the answer would be No, they didn't just use the VPN credentials; they continued using the backdoors as well.

The CTI report indicates that APT15 deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) for persistence and command and control. While they obtained VPN credentials, the backdoors were integral to their strategy for maintaining access. Therefore, they likely continued using the backdoors alongside the credentials.

Final Answer: B: No
