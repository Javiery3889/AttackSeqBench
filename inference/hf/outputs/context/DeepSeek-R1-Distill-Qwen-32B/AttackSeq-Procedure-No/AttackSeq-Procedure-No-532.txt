Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the threat actor, Dropping Elephant, uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks for reconnaissance. They send emails with documents that trigger a 'ping' to their server. Then, they exploit vulnerabilities in MS Word and PowerPoint to gain initial access. 

Once they've gained access, the backdoor they use is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server. The execution phase involves downloading encoded blobs that are decoded into PowerShell scripts. This is part of their defense evasion strategy because using encoded blobs helps them avoid detection.

In the collection phase, the report states that the file-stealer module looks for specific file types like .doc, .docx, .ppt, etc., and uploads them to the C2 server. It doesn't mention anything about browser cookies or stealing data from browsers like Chrome or Safari.

The question is asking if, after evading defenses by using PowerShell scripts, the backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, the collection activity is focused on document files, not browser data. There's no mention of any modules or activities related to browser cookie theft. So, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that they're targeting browser cookies. Their main goal appears to be stealing specific document types rather than browser data.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

The Dropping Elephant threat actor's activities, as detailed in the CTI report, focus on stealing specific document types rather than browser data. Their collection module targets files like .doc, .docx, and .ppt, without any mention of browser cookies. Thus, it's unlikely they steal Google Chrome or Apple Safari cookies.

Final Answer: B: No
