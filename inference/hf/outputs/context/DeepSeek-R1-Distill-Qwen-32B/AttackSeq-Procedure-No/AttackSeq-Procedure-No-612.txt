Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Bankshot implant uses a COM object to execute queries after being executed via the exploit in the malicious Word document. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the initial access is through spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, specifically CVE-2018-4878. This exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, which in this case is the Bankshot implant.

Looking at the attack sequence, after initial access, the implant is executed. The report describes Bankshot as a remote access tool that gives full capabilities on the victim's system. It also mentions that the implant has functionality to wipe files and evade detection. 

Now, the question is about whether the implant uses a COM object to gather system information. The report doesn't explicitly mention COM objects. It does talk about the implant's functionality, but not the specific method of execution. However, I know that in many malware cases, especially those using exploits, they often use COM objects to execute code because it's a common technique in Windows environments. For example, exploits might use COM to instantiate objects that can execute scripts or commands.

But wait, the report says the exploit is CVE-2018-4878, which is a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. Once the exploit is triggered, it executes arbitrary code, which is the Bankshot implant. The implant itself is a DLL that's disguised as a ZIP file. The report doesn't specify how the implant interacts with the system after execution, but it's designed to persist and evade detection.

Since the question is about whether it's likely that a COM object is used, I have to consider common practices. Many implants use various methods to execute code, and using COM is one of them. However, the report doesn't provide direct evidence of COM usage. It just says the exploit executes the implant, which then persists and can wipe files.

So, without explicit mention, I can't be certain. But given that the exploit is in Flash, which is a different technology, maybe the execution doesn't involve COM. Alternatively, the implant might use other methods to gather information, like direct API calls or other techniques.

Wait, the question is about executing queries to gather system information. COM objects are often used for scripting and automation, so if the implant needs to gather information, it might use them. But again, the report doesn't say. It just says the implant has functionality to wipe files and evade detection.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. The report doesn't mention COM objects, so I can't assume they're used. The question is whether it's likely, given the information. Since the report doesn't specify, maybe the answer is no, it's not likely based on the given info. Or perhaps it's yes because it's a common technique.

Wait, the question is about after initial access, when the implant is executed. The exploit is in Flash, which is separate from COM. The implant is a DLL, which might use other methods. So maybe the answer is no, it's not likely that a COM object is used in this specific case, as the report doesn't mention it and the exploit is in Flash.

Alternatively, maybe the implant uses other methods, but without evidence, I can't confirm. So perhaps the answer is no, it's not likely based on the provided information.
</think>

The CTI report details the use of a Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to execute the Bankshot implant, a remote access tool. While the report doesn't explicitly mention the use of COM objects, it's common for malware to use such methods. However, since the exploit is Flash-based and the report doesn't specify COM usage, it's not explicitly supported. Therefore, it's not likely based on the given information.

Final Answer: B: No
