Okay, so I need to figure out whether T9000 is likely to use LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials before exfiltrating data. Let me start by going through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report describes how T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting certain CVEs. It then goes through initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, command and control, and exfiltration. 

Looking at the Execution section, it mentions that the malware uses a legitimate Microsoft executable to sideload a malicious DLL. It also checks for security products and proceeds based on the system's properties. The Persistence section talks about registry keys and DLL injection into explorer.exe. 

Defense Evasion details how T9000 avoids detection by customizing installation and using checks at each stage. It also uses mutexes and named events. 

Command and Control describes communication with a C2 server using encrypted traffic, including a beacon and collected info. Exfiltration involves sending compressed and encrypted data, including screenshots, Skype comms, and files from removable drives.

Now, the question is about whether T9000 uses LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay for credential gathering before exfiltration. 

I know that LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are techniques used to capture NetNTLM credentials, often used in lateral movement or privilege escalation. These are part of the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically under Credential Access (T1552.002) and Lateral Movement (T1027.002). 

Looking back at the report, I don't see any mention of these specific techniques. The report talks about data exfiltration, including screenshots, Skype, and files, but not about credential gathering methods. It mentions defense evasion techniques but not credential theft via these specific methods. 

So, based on the information provided, there's no indication that T9000 uses LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay. The report focuses on how it evades detection, establishes persistence, communicates with C2, and exfiltrates data, but doesn't mention credential gathering techniques. 

Therefore, the answer is likely No.
</think>

The CTI report details T9000's methods for initial access, execution, persistence, evasion, command and control, and exfiltration but does not mention the use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay for credential gathering. These techniques are typically used for lateral movement or privilege escalation, which are not indicated in the report. The report focuses on data exfiltration and evasion without referencing credential theft methods. 

Final Answer: B: No
