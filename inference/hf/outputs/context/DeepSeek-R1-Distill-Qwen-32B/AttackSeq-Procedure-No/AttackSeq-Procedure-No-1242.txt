Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT28 divides files into smaller chunks if they're 0x1000000 bytes or more when uploading stolen data to their command and control (C&C) server. The question is asking if this is likely based on the CTI report provided.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step to extract relevant information. The report details various tactics and techniques used by APT28, also known as Sofacy. Let's break down the relevant sections.

The report mentions that during the Collection phase, APT28 deploys additional modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server. It also notes that these modules are crafted individually for each target system and can accommodate different plugins for data collection. 

Now, the question is about whether APT28 divides large files (0x1000000 bytes or more) when uploading. The answer choices are Yes or No. 

I don't see any explicit mention in the report about file chunking or dividing files based on size. The report talks about the modules used for collection and uploading but doesn't specify how they handle large files. However, I can make some educated inferences based on common APT behaviors and the information given.

APT groups often use techniques to avoid detection and ensure reliable data exfiltration. One common method is to split large files into smaller chunks to avoid raising suspicion, especially if the network monitoring is looking for large data transfers. This technique can help bypass certain detection mechanisms that might flag large file transfers.

Additionally, the report mentions that the modules are crafted individually for each target, which suggests that they might be tailored to handle different scenarios, including file size management. It's plausible that such modules would include functionality to split files to ensure successful upload without detection.

Moreover, the report states that the C&C communication uses HTTP on port 443 or 80, sometimes encrypted with 3DES and RSA. Encrypting data is a common practice, but it doesn't directly address file size. However, using HTTP for C&C suggests that they might be using standard web protocols, which often handle data in chunks, especially for large files.

Another point is the use of a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers. This indicates that APT28 is concerned with maintaining communication even through network restrictions, which could imply that they have mechanisms to handle data transmission efficiently, possibly including splitting files.

While the report doesn't explicitly state that APT28 divides files, the context suggests that they are sophisticated and would likely employ such techniques to avoid detection and ensure data is successfully exfiltrated. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that they would divide large files when uploading to the C&C server.

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely Yes.

The CTI report details APT28's use of modules like pr.dll for data collection and uploading to C&C servers. While it doesn't explicitly mention file chunking, common APT practices and the tailored nature of their modules suggest they would divide large files to avoid detection and ensure successful data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
