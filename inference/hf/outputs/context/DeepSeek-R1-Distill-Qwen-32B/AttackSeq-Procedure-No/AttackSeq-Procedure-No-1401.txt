Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement before using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of FIN13. Let me go through each section to understand their attack sequence.

Reconnaissance: They target Mexico since 2017, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality. They map networks, capture credentials, and steal documents for fraudulent money transfers. They use custom passive backdoors and tools for long-term intrusions.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

Execution: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file transfer, and proxying. They also use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor with an HTTP server on high ports.

Persistence: They replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions, use SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for C2 via email.

Privilege Escalation: They use ProcDump to dump LSASS, Mimikatz for credentials, and certutil for obfuscation. Also, trojanized KeePass for harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They use passive backdoors, chain web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING.

Credential Access: They dump LSASS, network sniffing, target unsecured credentials, and use trojanized KeePass.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal recon, gathering network and host info, user accounts, services.

Collection: They collect data from network shares, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using utilities, targeting data for fraud.

Command and Control: They use proxies, application layer protocols, non-application layer protocols, transfer tools, and encode data.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data via web services, using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

Others: They have a long dwell time, over five years, targeting only Mexico. Their endgame is processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. They don't use ransomware.

Now, the question is about the sequence after collection. The question asks if FIN13 will use Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement before using native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery.

Looking at the report, during the Discovery phase, FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware. So, they do use native OS tools for internal recon.

For lateral movement, the report mentions that during Execution, they use JSPRAT for command execution and file transfer. They also use web shells as a consistent gateway. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE. Invoke-WMIExec is a PowerShell tool used for lateral movement via WMI, and BUSTEDPIPE is a web shell.

The question is whether they would use these tools for lateral movement before using native OS tools for discovery. The report says they use web shells as a gateway, but it doesn't specify if they use Invoke-WMIExec. However, since they do use web shells, it's plausible they might use other web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. As for lateral movement, they might use WMI, but the report doesn't mention Invoke-WMIExec specifically.

But the key point is the sequence. The question is about after collection, which is part of the Collection phase. After collection, the next step would be exfiltration, but the question is about lateral movement before discovery. Wait, no, the question is about after collection, they collect data, then what? The question is whether they use these tools for lateral movement before using native OS tools for discovery.

Wait, the attack sequence in MITRE ATT&CK is typically: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Impact.

So, after Collection, the next steps would be Command and Control and Exfiltration. But the question is about lateral movement, which is part of the Execution phase, but lateral movement can occur during the attack lifecycle as needed.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sequence during the attack. So, after collecting data, they might need to move laterally to other systems to gather more data or establish persistence. So, would they use Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement before using native OS tools for discovery?

The report says they use JSPRAT for execution, which includes command execution and file transfer. They also use web shells as a gateway. So, using web shells like BUSTEDPIPE makes sense as part of their initial access or lateral movement. As for Invoke-WMIExec, it's a method for lateral movement via WMI, which is a common technique. Since the report mentions using native OS binaries, it's possible they use WMI as part of their execution.

But the question is whether they would use these tools before using native OS tools for discovery. The report says during Discovery, they use native OS tools. So, the sequence would be: after collection, they might move laterally using web shells or WMI, then perform discovery using native tools.

However, the report doesn't explicitly mention using Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE. It does mention using web shells as a gateway, so BUSTEDPIPE is plausible. Invoke-WMIExec is a specific tool, but the report doesn't mention it. However, since they use JSPRAT and other tools, it's possible they use other similar tools.

But the question is whether it's likely. The report doesn't provide evidence that they use Invoke-WMIExec, but they do use web shells. So, using BUSTEDPIPE is plausible, but Invoke-WMIExec is uncertain. However, the question is about the sequence: after collection, lateral movement via these tools, then discovery with native tools.

Given that the report says they use web shells and native OS tools for discovery, it's plausible that they would use web shells (like BUSTEDPIPE) for lateral movement before using native tools for discovery. As for Invoke-WMIExec, it's a possibility but not explicitly mentioned. However, since the question is about likelihood, and the report does mention using web shells, the answer would lean towards yes.

Wait, but the answer choices are Yes or No. The question is whether it's likely. The report doesn't mention Invoke-WMIExec, but it does mention using web shells. So, using BUSTEDPIPE is likely, but Invoke-WMIExec is uncertain. However, the question is about the sequence: after collection, lateral movement via these tools, then discovery.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is that after collection, they exfiltrate, but the question is about lateral movement before discovery. So, maybe the sequence is: collect data, then move laterally to other systems to collect more data, then perform discovery on those systems.

But the report says during Discovery, they use native OS tools. So, perhaps after moving laterally, they perform discovery on the new systems. So, the sequence would be: collect data, move laterally using web shells or WMI, then on the new systems, perform discovery using native tools.

Given that, the answer would be Yes, it's likely they use these tools for lateral movement before discovery.

Wait, but the report doesn't mention Invoke-WMIExec. So, maybe the answer is No because they don't use that specific tool. But the question is about likelihood, not certainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is No because the report doesn't mention using Invoke-WMIExec, so it's not likely they use it. But they do use web shells, so BUSTEDPIPE is possible.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The question is whether it's likely they use both tools. Since Invoke-WMIExec isn't mentioned, but web shells are, maybe the answer is No because they don't use Invoke-WMIExec. Or maybe Yes because they use web shells and possibly WMI.

I think the key is that the report mentions using web shells as a gateway, so BUSTEDPIPE is plausible. As for Invoke-WMIExec, it's a specific tool, but the report doesn't mention it. However, since they use JSPRAT for execution, which can be used for lateral movement, perhaps they don't need Invoke-WMIExec. Alternatively, they might use other methods.

But the question is about the sequence: after collection, lateral movement via these tools, then discovery. The report says they use native OS tools for discovery, so that part aligns. The lateral movement part: they use web shells, so BUSTEDPIPE is likely. Invoke-WMIExec is uncertain, but since the question is about likelihood, and the report doesn't mention it, maybe it's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Yes because they do use web shells, and lateral movement via WMI is possible even if not explicitly mentioned.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the answer is Yes because they use web shells, and lateral movement via WMI is a common technique, even if not explicitly mentioned. So, it's plausible they use these tools in that sequence.

The analysis of the CTI report indicates that FIN13 uses web shells as a consistent entry point and employs native OS tools for discovery. While the report doesn't explicitly mention Invoke-WMIExec, the use of web shells like BUSTEDPIPE is plausible.
