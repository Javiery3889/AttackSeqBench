Okay, so I need to figure out whether HIDDEN COBRA uses the MIME protocol to exfiltrate data after intercepting customer transactions. Let me start by understanding the CTI report and the question.

From the report, HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into checkout pages to intercept data like credit card numbers. Once a transaction is completed, the skimmer sends this data to their collection server. The report mentions that the skimming has been ongoing since May 2019 and that Sansec linked it to HIDDEN COBRA through reused infrastructure and code patterns.

The question is about whether they use MIME protocol for exfiltration. MIME is typically used in emails, but sometimes in data exfiltration, attackers might use it to encode data. However, in the context of web-based attacks, especially skimming, the data is usually sent via HTTP or HTTPS, not MIME.

Looking at the answer choices, it's a yes or no question. The report doesn't mention MIME specifically, but it does say the skimmer sends data to a C2 server. Common methods for such exfiltration are HTTP POST requests or similar web-based methods, not MIME. MIME is more associated with email, which isn't the method described here.

So, considering the information, it's unlikely they use MIME. Therefore, the answer is probably B: No.

The CTI report describes HIDDEN COBRA using malicious scripts to intercept data and send it to their C2 server. Typically, such exfiltration uses HTTP/HTTPS rather than MIME, which is more common in email. Since the report doesn't mention MIME and the context suggests web-based methods, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
