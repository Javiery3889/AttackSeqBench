Okay, so I need to figure out whether the QuasarRAT backdoor uses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique after achieving persistence. Let me start by going through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report mentions that QuasarRAT achieves persistence by installing itself as a service called DILLJUICE in later variants. The payload is encrypted and stored in the Microsoft.NET directory, decrypted in memory, and then instantiated using a CLR host application. So, the persistence mechanism is clearâ€”it's using a service installation.

Next, looking at the Defense Evasion section, the report states that the loader uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption. The initial loader uses the CppHostCLR technique to inject and execute the .NET loader assembly. It also mentions that the .NET loader is obfuscated with ConfuserEx v1.0.0 and that some samples are signed with a valid certificate. There's no mention of DDE here; instead, it's about obfuscation and encryption techniques.

The Command and Control section talks about communication with a C2 server using AES-128 encryption. Again, no mention of DDE.

In the Others section, it describes the MenuPass campaign and the functionalities of QuasarRAT, such as collecting system info, downloading files, keystroke logging, etc. It also mentions that the threat actor added a custom connectivity check and a URL download before connecting to the C2. Still, no indication of DDE being used.

Now, the question is whether the loader uses DDE after persistence. From the report, the loader uses CppHostCLR for injection, not DDE. DDE is a different technique often used for executing commands, sometimes seen in other malware for lateral movement or execution, but it's not mentioned here.

So, based on the information provided, the loader doesn't use DDE. It uses CppHostCLR for execution. Therefore, the answer should be No.

The CTI report details QuasarRAT's use of CppHostCLR for execution and does not mention DDE. Therefore, it is unlikely that DDE is utilized.

Final Answer: B: No
