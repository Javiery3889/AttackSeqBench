Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question based on the provided CTI report. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the CTI report carefully. The attack sequence is outlined using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The report mentions several steps:

1. **Initial Access**: The threat actors exploited a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
2. **Execution**: They used AntSword to run commands, upload tools like cURL, a custom Mimikatz, and Impacket's wmiexec and atexec.
3. **Defense Evasion**: They used a custom Mimikatz with a .NET loader and Dumpert to evade detection.
4. **Credential Access**: Mimikatz was used to dump credentials, and Impacket tools were used for pass-the-hash.
5. **Lateral Movement**: They moved laterally using webshells, Mimikatz for credential dumping, and Impacket's atexec.
6. **Command and Control**: Communication was done via AntSword webshell and Shell Manager.

Now, the question is asking whether, after using Mimikatz and Impacket for credential access, the actors will run commands for permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword and atexec.

Looking at the report, after credential access, the actors moved laterally. So the sequence is: they first gain access, execute tools, then use Mimikatz and Impacket for credentials, then move laterally. 

The question is about whether they perform permission group discovery after lateral movement. From the report, it seems that after lateral movement, they might continue to run commands, but the report doesn't explicitly mention permission group discovery. However, logically, after moving laterally, they might want to know what permissions they have on the new systems, which would involve discovering permission groups.

But the question is phrased as whether they will do this "only after" moving laterally. The report indicates that lateral movement was done after credential access, so any permission group discovery would naturally follow lateral movement. Therefore, it's likely that they would perform such discovery after moving laterally.

So, the answer should be "Yes," which is option A.
</think>

The CTI report outlines the attack sequence where the threat actors first gain initial access, execute tools, then use Mimikatz and Impacket for credential access, followed by lateral movement. After moving laterally, it's logical that they would perform permission group discovery to understand their access on the new systems. Therefore, the actors are likely to run such commands after lateral movement.

Final Answer: A
