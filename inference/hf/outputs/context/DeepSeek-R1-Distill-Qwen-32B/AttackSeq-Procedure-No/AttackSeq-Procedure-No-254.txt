Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the NanHaiShu malware creates SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies after gathering system information before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the initial access is through spearphishing emails with VBA macros. The macro executes a JScript file, which then does some things like saving a decoy file and creating a VBScript to delete the original. It also modifies the registry for persistence.

In the Execution phase, the JScript file is written to a specific location and executed. The macro also decodes a decoy file and creates a VBScript for deletion. The network.js file sets itself to autostart via the registry.

Persistence is established by modifying the registry entry to run network.js on startup.

Defense Evasion uses base64 encoding and obfuscation of URLs in the JScript code.

Discovery phase: The malware gathers system info like IP, Volume Serial Number, Computer Name, etc., and uploads it to the C&C server.

Exfiltration: It can download and execute additional JScript and VBScript code, which can be used for exfiltration of sensitive data.

Now, the question is about whether after gathering system info, it creates SOCK5 and custom proxies before downloading and executing code.

Looking at the report, the Exfiltration section says it can receive and execute additional scripts, which can exfiltrate data. But there's no mention of creating proxies like SOCK5 or custom protocols. The report doesn't detail any proxy creation steps. It focuses on data gathering and executing scripts, but not on setting up proxies.

So, based on the information given, there's no indication that NanHaiShu uses SOCK5 or custom proxies. Therefore, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details the attack sequence of the NanHaiShu malware, which includes initial access via spearphishing, execution of malicious scripts, persistence through registry modifications, defense evasion techniques, system information gathering, and potential data exfiltration. However, the report does not mention the creation of SOCK5 or custom protocol proxies. The focus is on data gathering and executing scripts, without evidence of proxy setup. 

Final Answer: B: No
