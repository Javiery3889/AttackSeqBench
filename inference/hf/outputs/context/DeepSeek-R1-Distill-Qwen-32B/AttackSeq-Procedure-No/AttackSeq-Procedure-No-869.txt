Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question based on the CTI report provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll read the CTI report carefully to understand the attack sequence. The report is about the Sednit group, also known as APT28, and their attack in August 2018. They used a spearphishing campaign with shortened URLs that led to a payload. The payload included an executable and a decoy PDF. When the executable ran, it prompted for a password and opened the decoy PDF, while a downloader in the background started running.

In the Execution phase, the operators took control of the backdoor and sent commands like taking screenshots, gathering system info, and executing commands. They used a Stage-1 downloader to get a new downloader, which then downloaded a Delphi backdoor. The backdoor's config was split into four encrypted blobs.

For Persistence, they used COM object hijacking and registry keys to execute the backdoor, but it was only active for a few hours.

Defense Evasion involved deleting files and killing processes to avoid detection.

In Credential Access, they used dumpers to target browsers and Outlook versions, retrieving databases from software like Firefox, The Bat!, and Opera.

Discovery phase involved gathering info about the victim's system, including registry keys, running processes, and using system commands.

Collection phase: The malware scanned for files with specific extensions on local systems, network drives, and removable media. It staged data by creating a file with paths of files to exfiltrate and had features for input and screen capture.

Exfiltration: Data was prepared with all file paths, sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted with known or custom algorithms.

Now, the question is about whether, after the Collection phase, data is sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

Looking at the Exfiltration section, it says data were automatically prepared and sent to the C&C server. It mentions encryption but doesn't specify anything about fallback servers or ports. The report doesn't mention anything about fallback C&C servers being used or becoming operational before data is sent. It just says data is sent to the C&C server, which implies the primary one.

So, the question is asking if the data is sent only after a fallback server is operational. Since the report doesn't mention fallback servers, it's likely that the primary server is used directly. Therefore, the answer would be No, it's not likely that they wait for a fallback server to become operational before sending data over commonly used ports.
</think>

The CTI report details the Sednit group's attack, focusing on their use of a primary C&C server for data exfiltration without mentioning fallback servers. The Exfiltration section indicates data is sent directly to the primary server, encrypted, but doesn't reference fallbacks. Thus, the data is sent without waiting for a fallback server.

Final Answer: B: No
