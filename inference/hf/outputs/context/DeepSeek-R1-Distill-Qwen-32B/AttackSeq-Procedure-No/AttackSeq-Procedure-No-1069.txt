Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, specifically after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details the attack sequence by Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. The attack starts with Initial Access, where they use exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. They download an installer package (.msi) and execute it using msiexec. 

Next, during the Execution phase, the installer drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which then deletes itself. UserInstall.exe uses the BITSadmin tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe, which is a legitimate Windows Gadget tool. The malicious loader, wab32res.dll, is dropped and uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe, leading to the execution of dllhost.exe. The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. The report also mentions that malicious documents don't need to download anything else because the backdoor is already embedded.

Looking at the question, it's asking if after injecting the DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, Tropic Trooper uses the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after the Equation Editor exploit. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the report, the sequence is: Equation Editor exploit leads to downloading and executing the MSI installer. The MSI drops UserInstall.exe, which then uses BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe. The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) is injected into dllhost.exe via DLL hijacking. There's no mention of a FakeRun loader in the report. The report talks about UserInstall.exe and the malicious loader, but not FakeRun.

So, the question is whether FakeRun is part of this sequence. Since the report doesn't mention FakeRun, it's likely that the answer is No. The attack sequence as described doesn't include FakeRun, so it's not part of the process after the DLL injection.
</think>

The CTI report outlines Tropic Trooper's attack sequence, which involves using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer, dropping a backdoor, and using DLL hijacking to inject a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe. The report does not mention the use of a FakeRun loader. Therefore, based on the information provided, Tropic Trooper is not likely to execute the FakeRun loader in this scenario.

Final Answer: B: No
