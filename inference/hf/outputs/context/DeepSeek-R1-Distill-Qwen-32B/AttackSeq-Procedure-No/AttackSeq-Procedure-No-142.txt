Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attack group harvested user login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase after using the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report mentions that in July to August 2011, the attacks used an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access. Then, during the same period, the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains. So, right after the initial access via the vulnerability, they used phishing domains to get credentials.

The question is asking if, after using that initial exploit, the group harvested credentials instead of using phishing. So, the key here is whether they used phishing or another method for credential access.

Looking at the report, it clearly states that they used phishing domains to gather credentials. So, the answer would be that they did use phishing domains, meaning they didn't harvest credentials without phishing. Therefore, the answer is No, it's not likely they harvested without using phishing.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "instead of using phishing domains." So, if they used phishing domains, then the answer is No, because they did use phishing. So the correct answer is B: No.

The CTI report indicates that after exploiting the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials. Therefore, they did use phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, making it unlikely that they harvested credentials without phishing.

Final Answer: B
