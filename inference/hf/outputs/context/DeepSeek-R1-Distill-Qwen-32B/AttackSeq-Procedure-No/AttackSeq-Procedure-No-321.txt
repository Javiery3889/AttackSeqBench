Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question based on the provided CTI report. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the CTI report is about Operation Pawn Storm, specifically looking at an iOS malware called XAgent. The report mentions that this malware is part of a larger campaign, similar to SEDNIT malware on Windows. The initial access method isn't explicitly detailed, but it's noted that the malware is installed on already compromised systems, which suggests that the initial access might have been through another method, perhaps phishing or exploiting a vulnerability.

Looking at the Execution section, the XAgent app is fully functional. On iOS 7, it hides its icon and runs in the background, restarting immediately if terminated. However, on iOS 8, the icon isn't hidden, and it can't restart automatically. This indicates that the malware was designed before iOS 8, which was released in September 2014. So, the malware's execution behavior varies depending on the iOS version.

In the Discovery section, the app collects various information: text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status. It also mentions that the app uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations. The question is asking whether, after uploading files via FTP, the malware is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing its routines on the iOS device.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. So, I need to determine if the malware sends information via HTTP after performing its data collection routines, or if it does so immediately upon collection.

From the report, it's clear that the malware's primary method of uploading files is via FTP. The report doesn't explicitly mention HTTP being used for sending data. It only states that the app uploads files via FTP as part of C2 operations. There's no indication that after FTP, it switches to HTTP for sending information. Instead, the data collection routines are performed, and then the data is uploaded via FTP.

Additionally, the report doesn't mention any use of HTTP in the context of data exfiltration. The focus is on FTP for uploading. Therefore, it's unlikely that the malware would switch to HTTP after FTP. The routines are performed, data is collected, and then it's sent via FTP. There's no reason to believe it would send via HTTP afterward unless specified, which it isn't.

So, considering the information, the answer would be B: No, because the malware uses FTP for uploading, and there's no indication it uses HTTP after that.
</think>

The CTI report details that the XAgent malware uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control operations. There is no mention of HTTP being used after FTP for sending gathered information. The malware's primary method of data exfiltration is FTP, and no evidence suggests a switch to HTTP post-upload. Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware sends information via HTTP after performing its routines.

Final Answer: B: No
