Okay, so I need to figure out whether Charming Kitten gathered targeted individuals' email addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase after creating fake websites. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report details a campaign by Charming Kitten, which involved creating fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram. These sites were used to extract credentials. The servers were hosted in Bulgaria, and they switched servers after a month. 

The report mentions that the campaign started with sending socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists, inviting victims to events. This is part of the Initial Access phase. Then, the second stage redirected victims to decoy websites. They also expanded their targets to include influential public figures in August 2019.

In the Defense Evasion section, it says they used email trackers to monitor if the phishing emails were forwarded and collected geolocation and IP addresses. They also used cookies to gather data. For Credential Access, they created phishing sites to steal credentials, which were part of the second stage aimed at data theft.

The Command and Control part mentions they used multiple servers to host fake websites and control them, collecting stolen data. The "Others" section attributes the campaign to Charming Kitten based on specific factors, including targeting non-Iranian investigators and using an Iranian NetBlock.

Now, the question is about whether they gathered email addresses through open source research and contact forms during Reconnaissance. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any mention of Reconnaissance phase activities. The report starts with Resource Development, then Initial Access, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Command and Control. There's no explicit mention of how they gathered email addresses beyond sending phishing emails and using fake websites.

The question suggests that after creating fake websites (Resource Development), they might have used open source research and contact forms during Reconnaissance. But the report doesn't provide information about how they obtained the email addresses of the targets. It only says they sent socially engineered emails impersonating known individuals, which implies they had the email addresses already.

So, without evidence in the report that they used open source research or contact forms, I can't assume they did. The report doesn't mention Reconnaissance activities, so it's unclear if they gathered email addresses through those methods. Therefore, it's not likely based on the given information.

The CTI report does not provide information about Charming Kitten using open source research or website contact forms during a Reconnaissance phase. The report details the creation of fake websites and the sending of phishing emails but does not specify how the email addresses were obtained. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that they gathered email addresses through these methods.

Final Answer: B: No
