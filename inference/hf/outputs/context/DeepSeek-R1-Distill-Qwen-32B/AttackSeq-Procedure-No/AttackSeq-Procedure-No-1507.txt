Okay, so I need to figure out whether RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter. The answer choices are Yes or No.

First, I'll go through the CTI report step by step. The report is divided into sections: Resource Development, Initial Access, Defense Evasion, Command and Control, and Others.

Starting with Resource Development: It says RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities, slightly modified and obfuscated. They use Obtain Capabilities and Compromise Infrastructure techniques. They also use malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to their landing page. So, the initial access is through malvertising or compromised sites, which redirect to their landing page.

Initial Access section: RIG EK delivers exploits via malvertising, redirecting to advertising pages that execute their exploits. They also use compromised sites with injected JavaScript. This is Drive-by Compromise, which is a technique where the exploit happens without much user interaction.

Defense Evasion: They use proxy servers and an antivirus testing feature. Not directly relevant to the question, but good to know.

Command and Control: They have VDS, proxies, and an API server. The exploit is encrypted with RC4. Again, not directly related to the delivery method.

Others: They've been active since 2014, target outdated IE, have a high exploitation rate, operate as a service, and have a relationship with Dridex.

Now, the question is about whether RIG EK uses an obfuscated PowerShell script after redirecting users. The report mentions that RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities and obfuscates their exploits. It also says they use malvertising and compromised sites to redirect users. But I don't see any mention of PowerShell scripts being used in the delivery process.

The question is asking if they run an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using Command and Scripting Interpreter. The report doesn't mention PowerShell at all. It talks about exploits being delivered through browser vulnerabilities, which are executed via JavaScript or similar, not PowerShell.

So, the delivery method is through malvertising and compromised sites, which redirect to exploit pages. The exploit is delivered via the browser, not through a PowerShell script. Therefore, the answer would be No, because the report doesn't indicate that PowerShell is part of their delivery mechanism.
</think>

The CTI report details RIG EK's methods, which include using malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to exploit pages. The exploits are delivered through browser vulnerabilities, not via PowerShell scripts. There is no mention of PowerShell in the report, indicating it's not part of their delivery process.

Final Answer: B: No
