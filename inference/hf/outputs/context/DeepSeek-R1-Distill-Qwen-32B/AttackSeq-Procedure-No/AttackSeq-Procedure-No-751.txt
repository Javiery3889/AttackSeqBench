Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information after ensuring persistence. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the attack starts with Reconnaissance, where they use job recruitment emails to gather info. Then, Initial Access is through malicious documents with macros. The macro injects the Sharpshooter downloader into Word, which then gets the Rising Sun implant from a control server.

Next, Execution: The shellcode from the macro acts as a downloader. It uses functions like LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress to resolve libraries and APIs. It downloads the second-stage payload (Rising Sun) and a decoy document. It places the payload in the startup folder and %LOCALAPPDATA%, then executes them using CreateProcessA and ShellExecuteA.

Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. So, during the download process, it's already setting up persistence.

Command and Control: The implant communicates via HTTP POST, encrypting data with RC4 and obfuscating with Base64. The control servers are listed.

Exfiltration: Data is encrypted and sent via HTTP POST.

In the Others section, it's noted that the implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process info, reading/writing files, and modifying attributes. It's suggested that the Rising Sun has backdoor features typical of such implants.

The question is whether, after communicating with control servers, the implant will fetch computer name and user name as part of discovery only after ensuring persistence.

So, the sequence is: Initial Access (malicious doc), Execution (downloading Rising Sun), Persistence (downloading to startup), then Command and Control (communication), and Exfiltration.

The question is about whether the implant will gather system info (computer name, username) after ensuring persistence. Since the implant has backdoor capabilities that include gathering drive and process info, it's likely that it would collect such information as part of its discovery phase.

But when does this happen? The report says that during the download process, the implant ensures persistence by placing the binary in the startup folder. So, the persistence is set up as part of the download. Then, after that, the implant communicates with the control server.

So, the sequence would be: download, set persistence, then communicate. Therefore, after persistence is ensured, the implant would likely start its discovery activities, including fetching computer name and username.

So, the answer would be Yes, it's likely that after ensuring persistence, the implant will fetch this info as part of discovery.

The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process. After establishing persistence, it communicates with control servers. Given its backdoor capabilities, it's likely to gather system information, including computer name and username, as part of its discovery activities post-persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
