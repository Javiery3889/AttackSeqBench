Okay, so I need to figure out whether Yellow Garuda divides the collected data into fixed-size chunks when exfiltrating it to avoid detection. Let me start by going through the CTI report and the question step by step.

First, the report mentions that Yellow Garuda uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. The exfiltrated data is stored in a SQLite database and also in JSON format. The tool can also delete messages from the victim's account. 

Now, the question is about whether this data is divided into fixed-size chunks during exfiltration to evade detection. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, I don't see any explicit mention of the data being split into chunks. The report does talk about defense evasion tactics, such as using RC4-encrypted strings and obtaining decryption keys via HTTP GET requests. These methods are used to disrupt analysis, especially if the password isn't available or the infrastructure is down. However, the report doesn't specify anything about chunking the data for exfiltration.

I know that some APT groups do use chunking to avoid detection, as large data transfers can be more easily spotted. But in this case, the report doesn't provide evidence of that. The main points are about encryption and remote decryption, not about how the data is split or sent.

So, based on the information given, there's no indication that Yellow Garuda uses fixed-size chunks for exfiltration. Their methods focus more on encryption and remote decryption rather than chunking. Therefore, the answer is likely No.

The CTI report details Yellow Garuda's use of encryption and remote decryption to evade detection but does not mention dividing data into fixed-size chunks during exfiltration. Their tactics focus on encryption rather than chunking. 

Final Answer: B: No
