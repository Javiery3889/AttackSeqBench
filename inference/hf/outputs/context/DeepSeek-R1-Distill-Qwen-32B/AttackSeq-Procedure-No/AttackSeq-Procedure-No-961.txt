Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Lazarus Group's malware communicates with C2 servers using only HTTP after moving laterally. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that during the attack, the Lazarus Group used a backdoor called CommsCacher. This backdoor had a configuration file encrypted with the VEST algorithm. The backdoor was used to monitor RDP sessions. They also attempted to connect to the domain forecareer[.]com, which was registered before the attack and mimicked General Dynamics' site.

Looking at the Lateral Movement section, it says they used compromised legitimate privileged accounts and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with C2 servers. So, they used their own encryption, not just HTTP.

In the Defense Evasion section, they encrypted configuration files and used rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL. They also hid malware in hidden folders and removed samples from the file system.

So, the key points are: they used their own encryption for C2 communication, not just HTTP. They also used encrypted configuration files. Therefore, it's unlikely they only used HTTP; they probably used their own encryption method.

The question is whether they used HTTP only. Since the report mentions their own encryption, the answer is No.
</think>

The Lazarus Group used their own encryption algorithm for C2 communication, indicating they didn't rely solely on HTTP. 

Final Answer: B: No
