Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether, after delivering a malicious Word document in a ZIP file, a COM object is used to execute queries to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file for the malware payload. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The initial access vector is a malicious Word document inside a ZIP file. The document has encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with VBA macros. The external template is downloaded via URL shorteners like TinyURL or Bitly, which redirect to an attacker-controlled domain. The VBA code decrypts the data and drops two files: 'fmx.ps1' (a PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

So, the initial steps are: ZIP file → Word document → VBA macros trigger → download external template → decrypt data → drop PowerShell scripts.

Now, the question is about whether a COM object is used to gather system info before the PowerShell script downloads the payload. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the report, after the VBA macros run, they decrypt the data and drop the PowerShell scripts. The report mentions that the VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops the files, but it doesn't explicitly mention the use of a COM object for system information gathering.

In the Defense Evasion section, it says the attackers switch the external template to a benign one after some time, and the payload is generated using image files. The Command and Control section mentions that the Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject into Internet Explorer and communicates with the C&C server using AES encryption.

I don't see any mention of COM objects being used in the attack sequence. The VBA macros are used to decrypt and drop the scripts, but the next step is the PowerShell scripts executing. The report doesn't specify that a COM object is involved in gathering system information before the payload download.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's not indicated that a COM object is used for system queries. The sequence goes from VBA macros to PowerShell scripts, without mentioning COM objects in that context.
</think>

The CTI report describes the attack sequence starting with a malicious Word document that uses VBA macros to decrypt data and drop PowerShell scripts. There is no mention of a COM object being used to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads the payload. Therefore, it is unlikely that a COM object is involved in this specific attack sequence.

Final Answer: B: No
