Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant communicates to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by gathering network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, system info, and OS product name. It also decrypted additional information, but not all was used. So, the implant does gather system and network info as part of its initial steps.

Next, regarding communication, the report says that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data using HTTP POST requests. It encrypted the data with RC4 and then obfuscated it with Base64. There's no mention of using Jabber/XMPP protocol or communicating with Google servers. The exfiltration method is clearly stated as HTTP, which is a common web protocol, not XMPP, which is used for instant messaging.

The question is asking if the implant communicates via Jabber/XMPP to Google servers before exfiltrating data. From the report, the only communication method mentioned is HTTP POST. There's no indication of using XMPP or targeting Google servers specifically. The report also doesn't mention any use of Jabber/XMPP in the C2 process.

So, putting it together, the implant uses HTTP for exfiltration, not XMPP. Therefore, it's unlikely that it communicates via Jabber/XMPP to Google servers before exfiltration.

The Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data using HTTP POST requests, not Jabber/XMPP. There's no mention of communication with Google servers or use of XMPP in the report. 

Final Answer: B: No
