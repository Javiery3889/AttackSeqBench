Okay, so I need to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails is likely to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The report describes a campaign where phishing emails with Word documents containing macros are used to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The attack sequence starts with Reconnaissance, where the threat actors send these phishing emails. Then, when the victim opens the Word document, a VBS macro executes, which runs a PowerShell script. This script downloads the payloads without writing to the disk, using DCOM to execute them. The Command and Control (C2) communication involves contacting hardcoded servers to download the malware. The Impact is the execution of GandCrab and Ursnif, which do their respective damage.

Now, the question is about whether this campaign is likely to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after initial access. I need to determine if the attack sequence includes such an exploit.

Looking at the report, the attack vector is through phishing emails with malicious Word documents. The execution involves macros and PowerShell scripts to download and execute malware. There's no mention of any network-based exploits or attacks against FortiOS devices. The report focuses on the initial access via phishing, execution through macros, and the subsequent malware activities. 

CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, which is a firewall product. Exploiting this would typically involve network-based attacks, perhaps targeting the firewall directly to gain access to the network. However, the report doesn't indicate any such activity. The campaign's method is more about social engineering (phishing) and using document-based exploits, not network device exploitation.

Additionally, the report mentions that the PowerShell script operates in memory and doesn't write to the disk, which is a common technique to avoid detection. It also talks about the C2 communication, but again, this is about downloading malware, not exploiting FortiOS.

The 'Others' section provides context about the analysis tools and variants but doesn't add anything about FortiOS or network device exploitation. The focus is on the malware delivery and the analysis of the samples, not on any network infrastructure attacks.

So, putting it all together, the campaign's attack vector doesn't involve exploiting FortiOS devices. It's a phishing campaign that delivers malware through documents, not a network-based exploit. Therefore, it's unlikely that they would exploit CVE-2018-13379 after initial access via the phishing emails.
</think>

The CTI report details a phishing campaign using malicious Word documents to deliver malware, without any mention of exploiting FortiOS devices. The attack vector is through document-based macros and PowerShell scripts, not network-based exploits. Therefore, it's unlikely they exploit CVE-2018-13379.

Final Answer: B: No
