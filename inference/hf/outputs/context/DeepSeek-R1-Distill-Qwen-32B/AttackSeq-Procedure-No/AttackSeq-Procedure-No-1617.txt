Okay, so I need to figure out whether Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase after monitoring network traffic. Let me go through the CTI report step by step.

First, the report mentions that Regin is a multi-staged modular threat. The initial access isn't specified, but it could be through a web browser or application exploit. Then, the execution process is detailed with six stages, each handling different tasks like installing, loading, and running subsequent stages. 

Looking at the discovery section, it says Regin's discovery capabilities include gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and retrieving them. It also monitors network traffic to IIS web servers and collects administration traffic for mobile telephony base stations. 

The question is about whether, after monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic, Regin would gather process and memory info and scan for deleted files. The answer choices are yes or no.

From the report, during the discovery phase, Regin does gather process and memory info and scan for deleted files. So, the answer should be yes.
</think>

The CTI report explicitly states that Regin's discovery phase includes gathering information on processes and memory utilization, as well as scanning for deleted files. Therefore, after monitoring network traffic, Regin is likely to perform these actions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
