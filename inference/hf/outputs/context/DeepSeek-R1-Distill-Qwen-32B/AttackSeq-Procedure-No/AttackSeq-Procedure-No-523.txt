Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI report provided. The initial access vector is a malicious Word document inside a ZIP file. The document has encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with VBA macros. The external template is downloaded via URL shorteners like TinyURL or Bitly, which redirect to an attacker-controlled domain.

When the VBA macros are enabled, they decrypt the embedded data and drop two files: 'fmx.ps1' (a PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (which is base64 encoded PowerShell code). So, the initial step is the delivery of the Word document, which leads to the execution of the VBA macros, which in turn decrypts and drops these two files.

Now, the question is about the sequence of actions after the initial access. Specifically, does 'fmx.ps1' download a zip file with malware components before decoding 'sdmc.jpg'?

Looking at the report, it says that the VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'. The report doesn't explicitly mention that 'fmx.ps1' downloads a zip file. Instead, it describes that the payload is generated using image files to conceal components, and the final payload is signed with valid certificates.

The 'fmx.ps1' is a PowerShell script, and 'sdmc.jpg' contains base64 encoded PowerShell code. So, perhaps 'fmx.ps1' is responsible for executing the code from 'sdmc.jpg'. The report doesn't mention 'fmx.ps1' downloading anything else; it just says it's a PowerShell script. The 'sdmc.jpg' is base64 encoded, so it would need to be decoded and executed.

Wait, but the question is whether 'fmx.ps1' will download a zip file containing components before decoding 'sdmc.jpg'. The report doesn't state that 'fmx.ps1' does any downloading. It only mentions that the VBA code drops these two files. So, the 'fmx.ps1' is already present after the VBA execution. Therefore, it's unlikely that 'fmx.ps1' would download another zip file because the necessary components are already there.

Moreover, the report says the payload is generated using image files, which suggests that the payload is within the image, not in a separate zip file. The 'sdmc.jpg' is the base64 encoded script, so 'fmx.ps1' might decode and execute it without needing to download anything else.

So, putting it together, the sequence is: Word document → VBA macros decrypt and drop 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' → 'fmx.ps1' executes, possibly decoding 'sdmc.jpg' without downloading additional files. Therefore, the answer is likely No, because 'fmx.ps1' doesn't download a zip file; it uses the already present 'sdmc.jpg' for the next step.

The analysis indicates that the 'fmx.ps1' script does not download a zip file but instead uses the already present 'sdmc.jpg' for further execution. 

Final Answer: B: No
