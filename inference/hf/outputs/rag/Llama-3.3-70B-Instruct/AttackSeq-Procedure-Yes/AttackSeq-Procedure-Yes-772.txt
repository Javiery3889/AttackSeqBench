To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where recipients are sent spear phishing emails with links to RTF (Rich Text Format) documents. These documents exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-8750) to deliver QuasarRAT (a type of remote access trojan). The question asks whether, in this scenario, it's likely that the recipients will be presented with a document that appears to be a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the use of a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. In this context, it refers to exploiting CVE-2017-8750 in RTF documents to execute QuasarRAT.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves sending a spear phishing email with a link to trick the recipient into clicking on it, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: Similar to the above, but involves attaching a malicious file (like an RTF document) to the email instead of a link.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of spear phishing with either links or attachments is a common initial access tactic. In this scenario, the exploit (CVE-2017-8750) is delivered via an RTF document, which aligns with T1566.001.
   - The exploitation of this vulnerability (T1203) leads to the execution of QuasarRAT. For the exploit to be successful, the recipient must open the RTF document.
   - It's a common social engineering tactic to make the document appear legitimate (e.g., a blog post or report) to increase the likelihood of the recipient opening it without suspicion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers aim to trick the recipient into opening the malicious RTF document.
   - To increase the success rate, making the document appear as a legitimate blog post or report would be an effective social engineering tactic.
   - Given the context of spear phishing and the exploitation of a vulnerability within a document, it is reasonable to conclude that the document would be designed to appear legitimate to the recipient.

**Final Answer: A**
