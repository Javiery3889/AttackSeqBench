To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker gains initial access to a system by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. After gaining access, the attacker executes SparrowDoor, a piece of malware, using cmd.exe commands. The question asks whether it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control. Web protocols can include HTTP and HTTPS, among others. The use of HTTPS is specifically relevant because it is an encrypted protocol, which can be used to hide the content of the communication between the malware and the C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This refers to the initial access method described in the question, where the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. This TTP is about how the attacker gets into the system, not about the communication methods used post-exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the question specifically mentions the execution of SparrowDoor for the purpose of establishing command and control, and considering the related TTPs, especially T1071.001-Web Protocols, it is reasonable to infer that the communication between SparrowDoor and its C&C server could indeed utilize web protocols. Since HTTPS is a common web protocol that provides encryption, making it harder to detect the communication content, it is plausible that SparrowDoor would use an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control communications to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker gains initial access through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - The attacker executes SparrowDoor, indicating the intent to establish command and control.
   - The related TTPs suggest the use of web protocols for command and control, and HTTPS is a web protocol that offers encryption.
   - Using an encrypted channel like HTTPS for C&C communication is a common tactic to avoid detection.
