To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group uses backdoor malware to establish command and control (C2) communication. This allows them to poll remote C2 servers for tasks and execute commands. The question then asks if it's likely that, following this, they would deploy Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and leave ransom notes.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This indicates that the attackers' goal is to have an impact on the victim's system or data, and one of the techniques used to achieve this is encrypting data. This is a common tactic used by ransomware, which aligns with the deployment of Hermes ransomware mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography for command and control communications. While this is related to how attackers might communicate with compromised systems, the question specifically mentions the use of backdoor malware for C2 communication, not the encryption method used for C2 itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of backdoor malware for establishing C2 communication sets the stage for further malicious activities, such as deploying additional malware.
   - The deployment of Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm (asymmetric cryptography for key exchange, with symmetric cryptography often used for the actual file encryption) and leaving ransom notes aligns with the tactic of having an impact through data encryption (T1486).
   - The mention of symmetric cryptography in the related TTPs might initially seem relevant to the C2 communication aspect, but the question's focus is on the subsequent action of deploying ransomware, which indeed involves encryption (and potentially symmetric cryptography for the encryption process itself, though the question specifies RSA, which is asymmetric).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lazarus group's use of backdoor malware for C2 communication indicates a capability and intent to conduct further malicious operations on the compromised system.
   - The deployment of ransomware, such as Hermes, to encrypt files and demand ransom is a common impact tactic that follows initial compromise and C2 establishment.
   - The specifics of the encryption method (2048-bit RSA algorithm) and the action of leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories are consistent with known ransomware tactics, including the use of encryption for impact.
   - Therefore, given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after establishing C2, the Lazarus group would deploy ransomware as part of their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
