To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an app that collects sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) from an iOS device and performs certain routines. It then asks if it's likely that the app would send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates that data exfiltration can occur over the same channels used for command and control, suggesting that an attacker might use the C2 channel for both sending commands and exfiltrating data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for command and control, which could include uploading files to a server controlled by the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over non-C2 channels that are not encrypted, such as HTTP. This is relevant because HTTP is an unencrypted protocol that can be used for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the techniques mentioned, it's plausible that an attacker could use HTTP (an unencrypted non-C2 protocol) for exfiltrating data, as indicated by T1048.003. 
   - The use of FTP for uploading files as part of C2 operations aligns with T1071.002, showing that file transfer protocols can be used for command and control purposes, which might include uploading files to a command and control server.
   - The sequence of sending information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP fits within the context of these techniques, as it involves both exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols (HTTP) and the use of file transfer protocols for C2 operations (FTP).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the tactics and techniques involved in the question (Exfiltration, Command and Control).
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the related TTPs to understand the context (T1041, T1071.002, T1048.003).
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the sequence described in the question aligns with the related TTPs. The sequence involves exfiltrating data via HTTP (unencrypted non-C2 protocol) and then uploading files via FTP (file transfer protocol for C2), which matches the techniques provided.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the related TTPs, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known tactics and techniques used in cyber attacks.

Final Answer: A
