To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about the likelihood of the Naikon APT group using HTTP and TCP protocols for Command and Control (C&C) communication after the Aria-body backdoor has collected information from the victim's machine. The question implies a sequence of actions where initial reconnaissance (information collection) is followed by C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for communication between the compromised system and the command and control server. This technique is commonly used by attackers for C&C communication because it blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves collecting information about the system, which aligns with the initial action described in the question where the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Aria-body backdoor has already collected system information (T1082), the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish a means of C&C to further exploit the system. 
   - The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication (T1071.001) is a common approach as it allows attackers to communicate with the compromised system in a way that is less likely to be detected, as this traffic can be disguised as normal web traffic.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that after collecting system information, the Naikon APT group would use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication to execute additional commands received from the server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of events starting with system information discovery.
   - The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for C&C after initial system discovery.
   - Using HTTP and TCP for C&C communication is a common tactic that follows initial reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events includes using HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication after the initial information collection.

Final Answer: A
