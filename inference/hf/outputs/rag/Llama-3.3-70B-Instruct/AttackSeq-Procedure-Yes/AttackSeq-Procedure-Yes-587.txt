To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the question and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers start by using a "DOCKERGEDDON" function for reconnaissance. This involves scanning netblocks to find misconfigured Docker APIs and then deploying malicious containers. Following this initial phase, the question asks if it's likely that attackers would use compromised websites to host malicious files as part of developing their infrastructure, and then exploit vulnerabilities using open-source and offensive security tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container**: This indicates the use of containers (like Docker) to execute malicious code or payloads. This aligns with the initial part of the question about deploying malicious containers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves using compromised websites to host malicious content, which could be used to infect visitors or as part of the attacker's infrastructure development. This aligns with the middle part of the question about using compromised websites to host malicious files.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595-Active Scanning**: This involves actively scanning for vulnerabilities or open services, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question, including the use of DOCKERGEDDON for scanning.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of activities starting with reconnaissance (scanning for misconfigured Docker APIs and deploying malicious containers), followed by potentially using compromised websites to host malicious files, and then exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence:
     - **Reconnaissance** is covered by the initial scanning activity and the T1595-Active Scanning technique.
     - **Deploying malicious containers** (T1610-Deploy Container) fits with the execution tactic following reconnaissance.
     - **Using compromised websites** for malicious purposes (T1608.004-Drive-by Target) under the resource development tactic aligns with the middle part of the question about developing attacker infrastructure.
     - The final part about **exploiting vulnerabilities** using open-source and offensive security tools, while not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, is a plausible next step after reconnaissance and setting up infrastructure, as it would be a way to further compromise targets or expand access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The sequence described in the question starts with reconnaissance and the deployment of malicious containers, which is supported by the related TTPs.
   - The use of compromised websites to host malicious files as part of developing the attacker's infrastructure is a plausible next step, given the T1608.004-Drive-by Target technique.
   - The exploitation of vulnerabilities, while not directly listed in the provided TTPs, logically follows the setup of infrastructure as a means to achieve the attackers' goals.
   - Therefore, considering the logical progression of attack activities and the alignment with the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question itself, leading to the conclusion that yes, it is likely attackers would leverage compromised websites and then exploit vulnerabilities as part of their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
