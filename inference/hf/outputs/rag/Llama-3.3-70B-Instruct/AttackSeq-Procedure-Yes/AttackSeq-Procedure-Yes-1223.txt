To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably APT10, has used Mimikatz for credential theft, accessed a Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deployed Trochilus, and copied the NTDS.DIT database file. The question then asks if it's likely that APT10 would log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**: This refers to the use of NTDS (NT Directory Service) to access credential information. The NTDS.DIT file contains the Active Directory database, which includes user credentials in hashed form. Copying this file is a method used by attackers to obtain valid credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a network. Valid accounts can be obtained through various means, including credential theft, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The actions described (using Mimikatz, deploying Trochilus, and copying the NTDS.DIT database) are aimed at obtaining valid credentials.
   - The use of valid accounts (obtained through the aforementioned techniques) to log in via Citrix servers is a plausible next step for lateral movement within the network. This is because using valid accounts can help attackers blend in with normal network activity, making their actions less suspicious.
   - Exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours could be a tactic to further avoid suspicion by mimicking the normal working patterns of users in that region, assuming the target network has users or connections in that area.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has obtained valid credentials through credential theft techniques.
   - **Step 2**: The attacker has the capability and motivation to use these credentials for further network access.
   - **Step 3**: Using valid accounts for login via Citrix servers aligns with the tactic of using valid accounts for initial access and could be a method for lateral movement.
   - **Step 4**: Mimicking the working hours of a specific region could be part of the attacker's strategy to remain undetected.

Given the information and the logical progression of the attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after obtaining valid credentials, APT10 would indeed use them to log in to the network via Citrix servers and might attempt to blend in with normal traffic patterns.

Final Answer: A
