To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware has executed system information discovery commands and returned the results to its Command and Control (C&C) server. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will attempt to communicate with its C&C infrastructure by mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows as part of its command and control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This indicates the malware is gathering information about the system it has compromised, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, **Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This suggests the malware is also interested in discovering information about the browsers installed on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already engaged in system information discovery (T1082) and considering the additional TTP of browser information discovery (T1217), it's reasonable to infer that the malware is gathering as much information as possible about the system and its applications, including browsers.
   - The act of mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows for C&C communication could be a tactic to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect. This aligns with common evasion techniques used by malware to avoid detection.
   - The provided TTPs focus on discovery, which is an early stage of an attack. However, the question's context implies a slightly later stage where the malware is now communicating with its C&C server. The use of a beacon mimicking a legitimate browser could be part of maintaining access or exfiltrating data, which follows the initial discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has performed system information discovery, indicating it's in the process of gathering data about the compromised system.
   - **Step 2**: The malware is also interested in browser information, suggesting it wants to understand the system's internet browsing capabilities and possibly use them for its advantage.
   - **Step 3**: Given the malware's interest in blending in and the common use of browser traffic for covert communication, mimicking a Firefox browser for C&C communication is a plausible next step.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, it is reasonable to conclude that after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, the malware might indeed attempt to communicate with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows.

Final Answer: A
