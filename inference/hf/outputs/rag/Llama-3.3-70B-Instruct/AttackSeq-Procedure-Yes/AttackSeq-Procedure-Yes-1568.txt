To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Turla, has already implemented file upload and download capabilities with its RPC (Remote Procedure Call) backdoor during the discovery phase. It then asks if Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives. It aligns with the action of collecting files from USB drives mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include recent files. This also aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is about discovering files and directories on a system, which is more related to the initial discovery phase mentioned but is foundational for later collection activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Turla has already established a presence through its RPC backdoor and has been through a discovery phase, it's logical that the next steps would involve utilizing the established access for collection purposes.
   - The techniques T1025 and T1005 directly relate to the actions of collecting recent files and files from USB drives, which are typical objectives during the collection phase of an attack.
   - The use of backdoor plugins for these purposes would be a natural extension of the capabilities already demonstrated by Turla, especially considering the context of the collection phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Turla has established a backdoor with file upload and download capabilities.
   - **Step 2**: The collection phase involves gathering specific data, which can include files from the local system and removable media.
   - **Step 3**: The related TTPs (T1025 and T1005) directly support the actions described in the question.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is logical that Turla would use its backdoor plugins for collecting recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

Final Answer: A
