To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware has already collected basic system information and is searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will save screen recording files in a specific format during the data collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, which is about gathering information that can be used to support targeting.
   - **Technique: T1125-Video Capture**, which involves capturing video from a device's camera.
   - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**, which involves capturing the screen of a device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the malware collecting system information and searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic.
   - Saving screen recording files could be part of the data collection process, especially if the attacker is interested in monitoring the victim's activities or capturing sensitive information displayed on the screen.
   - **Technique: T1113-Screen Capture** directly supports the action of saving screen recordings, as it involves capturing the screen, which could include saving the captures as video files (e.g., .avi format).
   - **Technique: T1125-Video Capture** is more about capturing video from the device's camera, which doesn't directly relate to saving screen recordings.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's actions (collecting system information and searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses) are part of the **Collection** tactic.
   - Saving screen recordings in the format [%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi can be seen as an extension of the collection effort, aimed at gathering more detailed information about the user's activities.
   - The technique that best supports saving screen recordings is **T1113-Screen Capture**, which is directly related to capturing and potentially saving screen content.
   - Therefore, given the context of the **Collection** tactic and the specific technique of **T1113-Screen Capture**, it is plausible that the malware would save screen recording files during the data collection phase.

Final Answer: A
