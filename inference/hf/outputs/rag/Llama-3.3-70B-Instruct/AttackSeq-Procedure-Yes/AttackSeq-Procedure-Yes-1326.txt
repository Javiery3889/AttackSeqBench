To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, it is likely that the malware searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts. This implies we are looking at the behavior of CosmicDuke in terms of expanding its data collection beyond just hard and network drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives. It's a method used by adversaries to gather information stored on removable devices.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique is about discovering peripheral devices that a computer system has connected to it, which could include removable drives, printers, etc. It's part of the discovery phase where an adversary tries to understand the environment they are operating in.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that CosmicDuke is already involved in targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, it suggests the malware is in an active phase of gathering information about the system and its connected storage devices.
   - The technique T1025 (Data from Removable Media) directly relates to the action of searching removable drives for files, which aligns with the expansion of data collection efforts beyond fixed and network storage.
   - The mention of T1120 (Peripheral Device Discovery) implies that the malware or its operators are interested in identifying connected devices, which could include removable media. This discovery phase is a precursor to potentially exploiting or utilizing these devices for data collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: CosmicDuke is involved in the discovery phase, targeting files on hard and network drives.
   - **Step 2**: The malware's behavior suggests an intent to gather as much data as possible.
   - **Step 3**: The related TTPs indicate that collecting data from removable media (T1025) is a plausible next step after discovering peripheral devices (T1120), which would include removable drives.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after targeting files on hard drives and network drives, CosmicDuke would likely search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

Final Answer: A
