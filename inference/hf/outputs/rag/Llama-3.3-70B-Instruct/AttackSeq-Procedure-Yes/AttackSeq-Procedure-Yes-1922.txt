To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors use phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension. This is a method used for initial access. The question then asks if it's likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control (C2) server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
   These TTPs indicate methods used by threat actors to gain initial access to a system, specifically through spearphishing, which involves sending targeted emails that attempt to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link/attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access vector described in the question involves delivering a malicious browser extension (FriarFox) via phishing emails. This aligns with the TTPs provided, which focus on spearphishing as a means of initial access.
   - The use of a malicious browser extension to contact a C2 server and retrieve additional payloads (like Scanbox) is a plausible next step after initial access. Malicious extensions can be designed to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands or download additional malware, which is a common tactic in the post-exploitation phase of an attack.
   - The Scanbox payload is known for its ability to conduct reconnaissance and gather information about the compromised system or network, which would be a logical step after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The threat actors use phishing emails to deliver a malicious browser extension, which is a known method for initial access.
   - **Step 2**: The malicious browser extension (FriarFox) is used to contact a C2 server, which is a common behavior for malware to receive further instructions or download additional payloads.
   - **Step 3**: Retrieving the Scanbox payload after establishing C2 communication is plausible as it aligns with post-exploitation tactics aimed at gathering more information about the compromised system or network.
   
Given the information and the logical progression of an attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access via a malicious browser extension delivered through phishing, threat actors would use this access to contact a C2 server and potentially retrieve additional payloads like Scanbox for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A
