To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with an Initial Access phase, where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT are sent. This is a form of spearphishing, which aligns with the Technique T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) under the Initial Access tactic. The question then asks if, after this initial phase, it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) to host malware Command and Control (C2) servers during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.004-Server**: This technique involves using servers as a means to develop or support capabilities for an operation. Compromised webservers could be used to host malicious scripts or tools, such as those for delivering malware.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This involves developing capabilities that can be used in operations, which could include setting up infrastructure like VPSs for hosting malware C2s.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is about using spearphishing with a link to gain initial access, which is what the initial phase of the attack involves.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial phase uses spearphishing with a link (T1566.002), which is a common method for gaining initial access to a target network.
   - For the Resource Development phase, using compromised webservers to host delivery scripts (like those for ENVYSCOUT) and VPSs for malware C2s aligns with the techniques T1584.004 (using servers for capability development) and T1587 (developing capabilities), respectively. These actions are typical of how adversaries might develop and utilize resources after gaining initial access, to support further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access method described fits known TTPs for gaining access to a network.
   - The actions described in the Resource Development phase (using compromised webservers and VPSs for hosting malware delivery scripts and C2s) are consistent with known techniques for developing and supporting malicious operations.
   - Therefore, given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after gaining initial access through spearphishing, an adversary would use compromised infrastructure like webservers and VPSs to support their operations.

Final Answer: A
