To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary, specifically APT10, has conducted internal reconnaissance. This reconnaissance involves mapping out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools. The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering systems on the network, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data in a location that can be accessed remotely, which could involve compressing data into archives for easier transfer.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about discovering network services, which is part of the reconnaissance phase but more focused on services rather than systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial step of using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for internal reconnaissance fits well with the Discovery tactics (T1018 and T1046).
   - Identifying systems of interest is a natural next step after network and system discovery, which would involve using the information gathered from T1018 and T1046 to select targets.
   - Using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives aligns with the Collection tactic, specifically T1074.002, as it involves preparing data for exfiltration by staging it in a compressed and possibly more manageable form.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance, which includes mapping out the network and identifying potential targets. This is consistent with the Discovery tactics mentioned.
   - **Step 2**: After identifying systems of interest, the next logical step would be to prepare for data exfiltration, which could involve staging data in a way that makes it easier to transfer, such as compressing it into multi-part archives.
   - **Step 3**: The use of remote command execution scripts to launch these compression tools fits with the tactics of accessing and manipulating data on remote systems, which is a common approach in cyber attacks for efficiency and stealth.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context provided by the related TTPs and the logical progression of an attack from reconnaissance to data staging, it is plausible that APT10 would engage in such activities as part of their operation.

Final Answer: A
