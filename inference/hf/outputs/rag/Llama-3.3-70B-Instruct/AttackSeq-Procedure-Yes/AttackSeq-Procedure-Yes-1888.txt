To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically FIN13, has obtained credentials through techniques such as process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and using trojanized KeePass binaries. The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The related TTPs provided are focused on the tactic of Credential Access, with specific techniques being:
   - **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves modifying authentication processes to make it easier for the attacker to access the system or network without being detected.
   - **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves dumping the memory of the LSASS process to obtain credentials. This is directly related to the initial actions described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that FIN13 has already obtained credentials, the next logical steps in a typical attack sequence would involve using those credentials to further infiltrate the network. System service discovery would be a reasonable step to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan the lateral movement. The use of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement is consistent with tactics used by sophisticated attackers to maintain access and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Obtaining Credentials**: FIN13 has used techniques like LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries to get credentials.
   - **Next Logical Step**: After obtaining credentials, an attacker would typically want to understand the network layout to move laterally.
   - **System Service Discovery**: This would involve identifying services running on the network to find vulnerabilities or points of entry for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Using WMI and custom web shells are plausible methods for moving laterally, as they can be used to execute commands on remote systems and maintain access.

Given the context and the tactics typically employed by sophisticated threat actors like FIN13, it is reasonable to conclude that after obtaining credentials, gathering information on services (system service discovery) would be a likely step before attempting to move laterally in the network.

**Final Answer: A**
