To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access. The initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. This implies the use of spearphishing with an attachment, which is a common method for delivering malware or malicious documents that can execute macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The provided TTPs are related to the initial access tactic, specifically:
   - **T1566.002: Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending phishing emails with a link to a malicious website or resource. However, this does not directly relate to executing macros from a document.
   - **T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The attachment could be a document (like a Word document) that contains macros designed to execute malicious code when opened.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the malicious file 'Richard_Johnson.doc' is an attachment and considering the techniques provided, the most relevant technique here is **T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique aligns with the scenario of sending a malicious document as an attachment. The execution of VBS macros from a Microsoft Word document is a plausible next step after the initial access is gained through opening such a malicious attachment, as it's a common method attackers use to execute malicious code on a victim's system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through a phishing email with a malicious attachment ('Richard_Johnson.doc').
   - The related TTPs indicate the use of spearphishing with attachments, which aligns with delivering malicious documents.
   - Executing VBS macros from a Microsoft Word document is a known method for post-initial access malicious activity.
   - Therefore, given the context and the TTPs provided, it is likely that the observed campaign would involve executing VBS macros after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
