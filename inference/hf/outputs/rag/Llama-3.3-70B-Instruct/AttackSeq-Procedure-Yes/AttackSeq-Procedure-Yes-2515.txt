To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the BlueDelta campaign uses a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter to collect emails. It then asks if it's likely that the campaign exfiltrated specific data (Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information) before using web protocols for Command and Control (C2) activities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**: This technique involves using web session cookies to evade detection, which could be relevant to maintaining access or moving laterally within a network without being detected.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols for C2, which aligns with the use of email-related mechanisms for communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting emails from a local system, which aligns with the initial action described in the question (collecting emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of collecting emails through a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter directly relates to **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**.
   - The exfiltration of a Roundcube session cookie could be a step to maintain access or facilitate further collection activities, potentially leveraging **T1550.004-Web Session Cookie** for defense evasion.
   - The use of web protocols for C2 activities after the initial collection and potential exfiltration of sensitive data (like session cookies, address books, and database information) aligns with **T1071.003-Mail Protocols**.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question seems plausible:
- The attackers start by collecting emails (T1114.001), which could involve gaining access to the victim's email system.
- They then exfiltrate sensitive information (like session cookies, which could be related to T1550.004, though it's more about evasion, the concept of accessing and utilizing session cookies for malicious purposes fits the narrative of exploiting access).
- Finally, they use mail protocols for C2 (T1071.003), which is a method to communicate with the compromised system or to issue commands.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial collection of emails suggests an interest in the victim's communication.
2. Exfiltrating a session cookie, address book, and database information would provide significant insight and control over the victim's email account and potentially the system.
3. Using web protocols for C2 after such exfiltration would be a logical step to maintain control and execute further malicious activities without direct network connections being obvious.

**Final Answer**: A
