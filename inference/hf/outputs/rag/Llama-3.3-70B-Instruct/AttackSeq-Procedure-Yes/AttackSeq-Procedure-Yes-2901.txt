To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT15, an advanced persistent threat group, has already obtained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and has stolen a VPN certificate for remote network access. It then asks if it's likely that APT15 would deploy specific backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) and use RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This suggests the use of domain accounts to gain initial access to a network, which aligns with the use of stolen domain administrator credentials.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This indicates a method to escalate privileges by bypassing user account control, which could be relevant to using tools like RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**: This further emphasizes the tactic of evading defenses by bypassing user account control, which is consistent with the actions described for RoyalCLI.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that APT15 has already obtained high-level access credentials and is looking to maintain access and possibly expand their control within the network, deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS would be a logical next step. These tools can provide persistent access and allow for further exploitation of the network.
   - The use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings aligns with the provided TTPs, especially those related to bypassing user account control for privilege escalation and defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT15 has gained initial access and escalated privileges, which aligns with the first two related TTPs.
   - **Step 2**: The use of backdoors for persistent access and tools like RoyalCLI for bypassing security controls fits the pattern of defense evasion and privilege escalation described in the TTPs.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that APT15 would indeed deploy such backdoors and leverage RoyalCLI for bypassing command prompt policy settings to maintain and expand their access.

Final Answer: A
