To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon, a known threat actor, uses an Outlook VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro for lateral movement. This involves sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets. The question then asks if it's likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This indicates the initial method of compromise, where attackers use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This suggests the use of automated tools or scripts to collect data, which could include scanning for sensitive documents.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This refers to the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts, such as VBA macros, for executing malicious code on a victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Gamaredon is using VBA macros for lateral movement, it indicates a level of sophistication and willingness to use scripting for malicious purposes.
   - The use of spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001) as an initial access method aligns with the described scenario of sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - The technique of automated collection (T1119) for scanning sensitive documents fits within the context of post-compromise activities, where an attacker would seek to gather valuable data.
   - The execution technique (T1059.005) involving Visual Basic aligns with the use of VBA macros mentioned in the scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Recognize that Gamaredon's use of VBA macros for lateral movement indicates a capability and intent to use scripting for malicious purposes.
   - **Step 2**: Acknowledge that the initial access method (spearphishing with attachments) and the use of VBA macros are consistent with the described scenario.
   - **Step 3**: Consider that automated collection (scanning for sensitive documents) is a plausible next step in the attack sequence, given the context of post-compromise activities aimed at data collection.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining access and using VBA macros for lateral movement, Gamaredon would likely deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

Final Answer: A
