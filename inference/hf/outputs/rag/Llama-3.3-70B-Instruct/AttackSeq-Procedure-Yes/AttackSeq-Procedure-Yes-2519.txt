To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the BlueDelta campaign likely used a specific vulnerability (CVE-2020-35730) in Roundcube mail servers for initial access and then exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that might be employed by an adversary like BlueDelta.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** - This refers to the adversary's initial entry point into a network. Techniques under this tactic involve exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, among others.
   - **Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet, such as web applications, to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2020-35730) in Roundcube mail servers, which are public-facing applications, for initial access. This aligns with the **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application** technique.
   - After gaining initial access, the question mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities. This implies a progression from initial access to further internal reconnaissance, which is a plausible next step in an attack sequence.
   - Given that the initial access tactic and the technique of exploiting public-facing applications are directly relevant to the scenario described, it suggests that the BlueDelta campaign could indeed have followed this path.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method described - exploiting CVE-2020-35730 in Roundcube mail servers.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that this method aligns with the T1190 technique of exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of subsequent actions (discovery activities) following initial access, which is a common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment with known TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the described sequence of events could have occurred.

Final Answer: A
