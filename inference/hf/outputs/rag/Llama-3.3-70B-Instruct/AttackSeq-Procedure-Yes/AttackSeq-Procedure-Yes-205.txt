To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions attributed to FamousSparrow, a threat actor. The actions include:
   - Utilizing cmd.exe to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor for execution.
   - Collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.
   - Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Credential Access, specifically:
   - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory. This technique involves obtaining credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for this purpose.
   - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping. This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which can be achieved through various means, including using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial step of executing a backdoor (SparrowDoor) using cmd.exe sets up a foothold for further malicious activities, including the potential for collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase. This is a common sequence in attack chains as understanding the system and its files can help in identifying potential targets for credential dumping.
   - The use of a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access aligns with the provided TTPs, specifically T1003.001-LSASS Memory and T1003-OS Credential Dumping. Mimikatz is known for its ability to extract credentials from LSASS memory and dump OS credentials, fitting the described actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The threat actor gains initial access and executes a backdoor, which is a common entry point for further exploitation.
   - **Step 2**: Collecting system information and probing files is a logical next step for understanding the environment and identifying potential targets for credential theft.
   - **Step 3**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential dumping aligns with known TTPs related to Credential Access, specifically those involving LSASS memory and OS credential dumping.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the logical progression of the attack sequence and its alignment with known TTPs related to Credential Access, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would engage in these activities as part of their attack chain.

Final Answer: A
