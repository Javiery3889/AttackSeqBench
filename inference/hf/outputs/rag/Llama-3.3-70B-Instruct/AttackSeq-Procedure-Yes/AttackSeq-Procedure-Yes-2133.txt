To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Konni APT Group has used 'versioninfo.bat' to collect information about a user's computer. It then asks if this group is likely to send the collected data through 'unactivate.vbs' before exfiltrating it via a POST request. The key elements here are the use of specific tools ('versioninfo.bat' and 'unactivate.vbs') and the method of exfiltration (via a POST request).

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique of T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This indicates that the focus is on how data is exfiltrated from a compromised system, specifically over a Command and Control (C2) channel.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique involves transferring data from a compromised system to a C2 server controlled by the adversary. The use of a POST request could be a method to achieve this, as it's a common way to send data over HTTP to a server.
    - **Use of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'unactivate.vbs'**: While the specific tools are not directly mentioned in the TTPs, the question implies that 'versioninfo.bat' is used for collecting system information, and 'unactivate.vbs' might be involved in the process of handling or preparing this collected data for exfiltration.
    - **Likelihood of Sending Data through 'unactivate.vbs'**: Without specific details on what 'unactivate.vbs' does, we can infer from the context that if it's mentioned alongside the collection of system information and the exfiltration method, it might play a role in the data handling process before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The question implies a sequence of actions: data collection, potential data handling/preparation, and then exfiltration.
    - The use of specific tools ('versioninfo.bat' for data collection and potentially 'unactivate.vbs' for data handling) followed by exfiltration via a POST request suggests a deliberate process for gathering and sending sensitive information.
    - Given the context of TTPs focusing on exfiltration over C2 channels, the scenario described fits within the tactics and techniques used by APT groups for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
