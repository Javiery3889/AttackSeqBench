To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether MuddyWater, after gaining initial access by downloading files infected with macros, is likely to use compromised servers to host malicious code as part of their Command and Control (C2) operations. This implies we are looking at the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to how an adversary maintains control over a compromised system or network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is about how attackers communicate with systems under their control. It involves establishing and maintaining a channel to issue commands and receive data.
   - **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple, potentially disparate, communication channels to issue commands or transfer data. It can make detection more difficult by spreading out the communication across different protocols or servers.
   - **Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools or code into a compromised system. It's a way for attackers to bring in additional malicious capabilities after initial access has been achieved.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that MuddyWater has already used compromised C2 servers for initial access, it suggests they are capable of leveraging existing infrastructure for their operations.
   - The use of **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** implies a level of sophistication in their C2 operations, potentially including the use of compromised servers to host malicious code as part of maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** further supports the idea that after initial access, an attacker would want to bring in additional tools, which could be hosted on compromised servers as part of their C2 infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: MuddyWater's initial use of compromised C2 servers for downloading files infected with macros indicates a reliance on compromised infrastructure for initial access.
   - **Step 2**: The techniques of **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** and **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** are both relevant to maintaining command and control, with the former suggesting the use of multiple channels (which could include compromised servers) and the latter indicating the transfer of tools into a compromised environment.
   - **Step 3**: Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that MuddyWater would continue to leverage compromised servers as part of their C2 operations, including hosting malicious code, to maintain control and execute their objectives within a compromised network.

**Final Answer: A**
