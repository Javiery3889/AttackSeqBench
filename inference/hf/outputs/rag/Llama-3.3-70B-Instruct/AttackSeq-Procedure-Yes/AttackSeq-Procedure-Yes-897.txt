To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the provided Related TTPs.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific attack sequence involving the delivery of the KerrDown malware through malicious Microsoft Office documents or RAR archives that utilize DLL side-loading. It mentions the use of an image file within the Office document to instruct the victim to enable macros, which then leads to the execution of a malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture using base64 blobs.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The Related TTPs provided include a Tactic (Execution) and a Technique (T1204.002 - Malicious File). T1204.002 specifically refers to the use of malicious files, which can include Office documents with macros, to execute malicious code on a victim's system. This technique aligns with the initial part of the attack sequence described in the question, which involves delivering malware through malicious Office documents with macros.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: 
    - The use of malicious Office documents with macros (T1204.002) is a common technique for executing malicious code on a victim's system. 
    - The inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a social engineering tactic to increase the likelihood of the malware being executed.
    - The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture suggests a level of sophistication in the malware, allowing it to adapt to different environments.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question (instructing the victim to enable macros and then using base64 blobs for payload execution) is plausible and aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in malware campaigns. The social engineering aspect (instructing the victim to enable macros) combined with the technical capability to execute a payload based on system architecture fits within the context of using malicious files for execution (T1204.002).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question describes a specific and detailed sequence of events that aligns with known methods of malware delivery and execution.
    - The use of social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros is a common precursor to executing malicious code.
    - The adaptation of the payload execution based on the victim's system architecture indicates a level of sophistication that is consistent with modern malware campaigns.
    - Therefore, given the context and the Related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the described sequence of events could indeed occur as part of a malware campaign.

Final Answer: A
