To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where an Excel document exploits CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution. This exploit allows the attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's system without being detected. After gaining execution, the question asks if it's likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the attacker is using a vulnerability (in this case, CVE-2017-11882) to execute malicious code on the client-side.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This technique involves hiding files or directories to evade detection. The question mistakenly references T1158, but based on the context and the provided TTPs, it seems to be referring to a technique related to hiding files or directories, which aligns with T1564.001.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The attack has already gained execution through exploiting a vulnerability, which aligns with T1203.
   - The next logical step for an attacker, after gaining access and before proceeding with further malicious activities like searching for and extracting credentials, would be to ensure their presence remains undetected. Hiding artifacts (such as tools, scripts, or any files used for the attack) by employing techniques like hiding files and directories (T1564.001) would be a common defense evasion tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gains silent code execution through an exploited vulnerability in an Excel document.
   - **Step 2**: To maintain stealth, the attacker would likely want to hide any artifacts that could be detected by security software or system administrators.
   - **Step 3**: Hiding files and directories (as per T1564.001) is a plausible next step to avoid detection before proceeding with sensitive operations like credential extraction.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker would attempt to hide artifacts to remain undetected before searching for and extracting credentials.

Final Answer: A
