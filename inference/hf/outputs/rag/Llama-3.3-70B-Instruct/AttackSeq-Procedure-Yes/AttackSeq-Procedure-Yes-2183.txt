To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Taidoor malware uses RC4 encryption (a form of symmetric cryptography) with the victim's MAC address as the encryption key to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will upload files to the C&C server for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**: This is about the adversary stealing data from the victim's system.
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. Given that the malware is already communicating with a C&C server, this technique suggests that data exfiltration could occur over this established communication channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**: This involves the adversary controlling the malware on the victim's system remotely.
   - **Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption (like RC4) for communication. The use of symmetric cryptography (with the MAC address as a key) for encrypting communication between the malware and the C&C server is mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of symmetric cryptography (RC4) for communication between the malware and the C&C server (T1573.001) sets up a secure channel.
   - The fact that the malware is communicating with a C&C server implies that it has the capability to send and receive data.
   - The technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) directly supports the idea that data can be exfiltrated over the command and control channel, which is already established and secured with encryption.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has established a secure communication channel with its C&C server using RC4 encryption.
   - **Step 2**: The technique T1041 indicates that exfiltration can occur over the C2 channel, which aligns with the established communication between the malware and the C&C server.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware could use this established and encrypted channel for data exfiltration.
