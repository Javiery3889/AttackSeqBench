To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals have used Shodan and Censys for reconnaissance to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations. It then asks if it's likely they would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.005-Scan Databases**: This involves scanning databases to gather information about a target. Shodan and Censys are tools that can be used for this purpose, as they scan the internet for publicly accessible devices and services.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves discovering the services running on a network, which could include identifying specific protocols like MQTT, or finding outdated systems such as Building Management systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial step of using Shodan and Censys aligns with the reconnaissance tactic, specifically scanning databases to identify potential targets.
   - The next logical step after identifying potential targets (in this case, medical organizations) would be to delve deeper into the network to discover specific services or systems that could be vulnerable. This is where the discovery tactic comes into play, particularly network service discovery.
   - Identifying outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol fits within the scope of network service discovery. These systems/devices could be vulnerable due to outdated software, lack of security patches, or inherent vulnerabilities in the MQTT protocol implementation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Cybercriminals use Shodan and Censys for reconnaissance to identify potential targets, which aligns with scanning databases (T1596.005).
   - **Step 2**: After identifying medical organizations as targets, the next step would logically involve discovering specific vulnerabilities or services within those organizations' networks.
   - **Step 3**: Discovering outdated Building Management systems or devices supporting the MQTT protocol is a plausible next step, as it involves network service discovery (T1046) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover such vulnerabilities after the initial reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: A
