To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware is configured for Command and Control (C&C) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. It asks whether, given this setup, it's likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data in a scheduled manner to avoid detection. Scheduled transfers can make it harder for defenders to detect the exfiltration because the data is sent at predictable intervals, which can blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using the same channel established for command and control to exfiltrate data. This can be efficient for attackers, as they don't need to establish a separate channel for data exfiltration, potentially reducing the likelihood of detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware is configured for C&C communication over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol, it suggests a level of sophistication and an intent to maintain stealth.
   - The use of scheduled transfers (T1029) and exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) are both techniques that could be employed to avoid detection. Scheduled transfers help in blending the exfiltration traffic with regular network activity, while exfiltrating over the C2 channel minimizes the number of channels that need to be established and maintained, reducing the attack surface.
   - The question mentions avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals, which aligns with the principles behind scheduled transfers and potentially using an existing C2 channel for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's configuration for C&C communication indicates a capability for external communication.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS suggests an attempt to maintain secrecy and avoid detection.
   - **Step 3**: Scheduled exfiltration (T1029) and exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) are both plausible methods for avoiding detection, given the context.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication of the malware's communication setup and the tactics described, it is reasonable to conclude that Longhorn's malware would indeed communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A
