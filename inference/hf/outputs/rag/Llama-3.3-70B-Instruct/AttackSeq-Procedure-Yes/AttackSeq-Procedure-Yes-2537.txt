To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Milestone backdoor has already established persistence on a system by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry. It then asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Defense Evasion tactics. Specifically:
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves adversaries using a name or location that is similar to a legitimate system file or service to hide their malicious files or services.
   - **T1553.006 - Code Signing Policy Modification**: This involves modifying code signing policies to allow malicious code to appear as if it is signed and thus legitimate.
   - **T1112 - Modify Registry**: Adversaries modify registry entries to hide their malware or achieve persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: The question mentions the use of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion through DKOM. DKOM is a technique used by rootkits to directly manipulate kernel objects, allowing them to hide processes, files, or other system activities from the operating system. This is a sophisticated method of evasion that aligns with the tactics of modifying system components to avoid detection.

Given the context of the Milestone backdoor's actions (creating a service and copying itself to a specific location, potentially leveraging techniques like T1036.005 to blend in), and considering the goal of Defense Evasion, deploying a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili would indeed be a plausible next step. This is because kernel rootkits can effectively hide malicious activities, including the backdoor's communications and the subsequent system information discovery and screen capture functionalities, from security software.

Moreover, the mentioned TTPs (especially T1112 - Modify Registry) indicate a pattern of behavior where adversaries modify system settings to maintain access and evade detection, which aligns with the deployment of a rootkit for further evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Milestone backdoor has established persistence, indicating a desire for long-term access to the system.
   - The use of techniques like creating a service and copying to `%APPDATA%` suggests an attempt to blend in with legitimate system activities.
   - The question of deploying the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM is about further evading detection to facilitate undisturbed operation, including system information discovery and screen capture.
   - The provided TTPs indicate a focus on evasion and persistence, which deploying a kernel rootkit would support.

**Final Answer: A**
