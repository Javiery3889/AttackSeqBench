To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Longhorn gains initial access to a target system by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document, leading to the infection with Plexor malware. It then asks if it's likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection (as outlined in the Vault 7 documents) before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the initial access vector where an adversary exploits a vulnerability in client software (in this case, a Word document) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves the adversary gathering information about the system, which could include details like the operating system, hardware, and software configurations.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is used by the adversary to gather information about the file system and directory structures on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploitation (T1203) is used to gain access to the system.
   - Following the exploitation, the next logical steps for an adversary would involve trying to understand the environment they have accessed. This is where system information discovery (T1082) and file and directory discovery (T1083) come into play.
   - The question of whether Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing these discovery actions is crucial. Given that the Vault 7 documents are known to contain information on how to maintain stealth and evade detection, it is reasonable to assume that an advanced adversary like Longhorn would take steps to minimize their footprint before proceeding with potentially noisy discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Longhorn gains initial access through exploitation.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively navigate and utilize the compromised system without being detected, it would be beneficial for Longhorn to follow guidelines that help in evading detection.
   - **Step 3**: The discovery techniques (T1082 and T1083) are essential for understanding the system and planning further actions but could potentially alert security systems if not done carefully.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved, it is plausible that Longhorn would attempt to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting. This approach aligns with the behavior of sophisticated threat actors who seek to maintain access and gather intelligence without alerting the target.

Final Answer: A
