To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after discovering relevant systems, users, and data, attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement before collecting the relevant data. This involves understanding the typical sequence of actions an attacker might take during a cyber attack, specifically focusing on the phases of discovery, lateral movement, persistence, and data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to "Privilege Escalation" and "Collection". 
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** involves techniques used by attackers to gain higher privileges on a system or network. 
   - **Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions** is a method under Privilege Escalation where attackers may load kernel modules to escalate privileges, which can also be used for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Collection** involves gathering information relevant to the attacker's objectives.
   - **Technique: T1005-Data from Local System** refers to collecting data from local system sources, which is part of the Collection tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - Installing further persistence points during lateral movement aligns with the goal of maintaining access to the network and ensuring that the attacker can collect data without interruption. 
   - The use of kernel modules and extensions (T1547.006) for privilege escalation can also serve as a means to establish persistence, as it allows attackers to maintain control over systems even after reboots or other system changes.
   - The collection of data from local systems (T1005) is a key objective for attackers but typically follows the establishment of a stable foothold in the network, which persistence mechanisms help achieve.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Attackers discover relevant systems, users, and data, indicating they are in the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Step 2**: To ensure uninterrupted access and to facilitate the collection of data, attackers would logically install further persistence points. This is especially crucial during lateral movement, as it allows them to maintain access to different parts of the network.
   - **Step 3**: The use of techniques like loading kernel modules for privilege escalation (T1547.006) supports the idea that attackers would seek to establish robust persistence mechanisms.
   - **Step 4**: Finally, collecting data from local systems (T1005) is more effectively and securely done after ensuring persistence, as it allows attackers to gather data without worrying about losing access to the system.

Given these steps and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that attackers would indeed install further persistence points during lateral movement to secure their access before proceeding to collect relevant data.

Final Answer: A
