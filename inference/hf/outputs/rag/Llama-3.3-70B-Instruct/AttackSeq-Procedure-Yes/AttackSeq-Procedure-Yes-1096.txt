To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the question and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, identified as the Lazarus Group, uses system utilities for reconnaissance and gains initial access through malicious documents. It then asks if it's likely that the group used specific tools (net user and SMBMap) for network share discovery before moving laterally across the network using compromised legitimate privileged accounts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This indicates the use of domain accounts for initial access, which aligns with the scenario of gaining access through malicious documents that could lead to the compromise of domain accounts.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This suggests the use of SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, which could involve tools like SMBMap for discovering and potentially exploiting these shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of system utilities like ipconfig.exe and ping.exe for reconnaissance is a common initial step in network exploration.
   - Gaining initial access through malicious documents with job offers is a known tactic used by various threat actors, including the Lazarus Group, to compromise systems.
   - The use of "net user" for adding new user accounts or modifying existing ones could be part of the process to create backdoors or gain elevated privileges.
   - SMBMap is a tool that can be used for network share discovery, which aligns with the technique of using SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement (T1021.002).
   - Leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement is a common tactic as it allows attackers to move undetected within a network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access method described (malicious documents) and the use of system utilities for reconnaissance are plausible initial steps.
   - The use of "net user" and SMBMap for network share discovery fits within the context of preparing for lateral movement by identifying accessible shares and potentially creating or modifying accounts to facilitate this movement.
   - The final step of leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement is consistent with known tactics used by sophisticated threat actors like the Lazarus Group to maintain access and move undetected within a network.

Given the information and the related TTPs, the scenario described in the question aligns well with known tactics and techniques used by the Lazarus Group and other sophisticated threat actors. Therefore, it is plausible that the Lazarus Group would use such a sequence of TTPs for network compromise and lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A**
