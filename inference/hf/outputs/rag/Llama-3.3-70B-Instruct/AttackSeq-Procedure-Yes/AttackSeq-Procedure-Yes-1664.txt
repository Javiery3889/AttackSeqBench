To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, BlueBravo, uses spearphishing emails with malicious links to deliver malware (GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton) to a victim's system. It then asks if it's likely that BlueBravo would use these malware loaders to gather system information before employing other malware for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** - This refers to the tactics used by attackers to gain initial access to a network or system.
   - **Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link** - This is a specific technique under the Initial Access tactic where attackers send emails with malicious links to gain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of spearphishing with malicious links (T1566.002) is a common initial access technique to deliver malware.
   - GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton are described as malware loaders, which are typically used to load additional malware onto a compromised system.
   - Gathering system information (such as username, computer name, and network connections) is a common step after initial access to understand the victim's environment and plan further actions.
   - Employing known malware families for continued operation is a logical next step after gathering system information, as it allows the attacker to exploit the system further or maintain persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: BlueBravo uses spearphishing with malicious links to deliver malware, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic and the T1566.002 technique.
   - **Step 2**: The delivered malware (GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton) are loaders, which are typically used to facilitate further malicious activity.
   - **Step 3**: Gathering system information is a logical next step after gaining initial access to plan the attack's next phases.
   - **Step 4**: Using the gathered information to employ known malware families for continued operation is consistent with how attackers typically proceed after initial access and reconnaissance.

Given these steps, it is reasonable to conclude that after delivering malware through spearphishing, BlueBravo would likely use these malware loaders to gather victim system information before employing other malware for continued operation.

Final Answer: A
