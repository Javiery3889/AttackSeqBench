To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, FamousSparrow, has already gained access to a system and is using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential dumping. This action is associated with the Credential Access tactic. The question then asks if, after this step, the attacker is likely to collect system information during the Discovery phase before proceeding to read file contents and exfiltrate them.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP involves collecting information about the system, which can include usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types. This technique is crucial for understanding the environment, identifying potential targets, and planning further actions.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing credential information stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for performing this action, allowing attackers to obtain plaintext passwords, hash, or Kerberos tickets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attacker has already used Mimikatz for credential dumping (T1003.001), which falls under Credential Access, the next logical steps would involve utilizing the accessed credentials to further explore the system.
   - Collecting system information (T1082) during the Discovery phase is a common next step after gaining initial access or credentials. This information helps in identifying valuable data, understanding system configurations, and planning the exfiltration process.
   - Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to a Command and Control (C&C) server would typically follow the collection of system information, as the attacker would need to know what data is available and where it is located before exfiltrating it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker uses Mimikatz for credential dumping, indicating they are in the Credential Access phase.
   - **Step 2**: After obtaining credentials, the logical next step involves using those credentials to gather more information about the system, which aligns with the Discovery tactic and specifically the System Information Discovery technique (T1082).
   - **Step 3**: With system information collected, the attacker can then proceed to read file contents and exfiltrate data to the C&C server, as these actions require knowledge of the system layout and data locations.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the typical flow of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after dumping credentials, FamousSparrow would likely collect system information during the Discovery phase before reading and exfiltrating files.

Final Answer: A
