To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Outlaw group uses the Shellbot malware to maintain communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers via Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It asks whether, after establishing this communication, the malware is likely to gather information about the infected host before setting up the IRC channel for command reception and operation orchestration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This indicates the use of application-layer protocols (like IRC) for command and control. It suggests that the attackers are using a higher-layer protocol to communicate with the compromised system, which is consistent with the use of IRC for C&C.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations. This technique is typically used to understand the environment and potentially identify vulnerabilities or useful resources on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: first, the malware establishes communication with C&C servers, and then it potentially gathers system information.
   - The use of Shellbot for maintaining persistent communication via IRC aligns with the Command and Control tactic (T1071).
   - Gathering information about the infected host, such as processor details and installed monitoring tools, fits the System Information Discovery technique (T1082). This action would logically precede or follow the establishment of a stable C&C channel, as understanding the host's capabilities and environment would be crucial for planning subsequent malicious activities.
   - Establishing and maintaining an IRC channel for receiving commands and orchestrating operations is a key aspect of Command and Control, facilitated by the Application Layer Protocol technique (T1071).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's primary goal after infection is often to establish a reliable means of communication with its C&C servers.
   - Gathering system information (T1082) is a common step after initial infection to understand the target environment better.
   - The use of IRC for C&C (T1071) is a method to receive commands and orchestrate operations, which can be more effectively done after understanding the system's capabilities and potential security measures.
   - Therefore, it is logical that after establishing initial communication, the malware would gather information about the host before or as it establishes and maintains the IRC channel for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: A
