To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether Dexphot, after using process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes, is likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion. This implies we are looking at tactics used by malware (in this case, Dexphot) to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with the **Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**. This indicates that the adversary is using process hollowing as a method to evade defenses by hiding malicious code within legitimate processes.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**, also with the **Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**. This shows that process hollowing can also be used to escalate privileges, potentially allowing the adversary to gain more control over the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Process hollowing (T1055.012) is a technique used for defense evasion, where the adversary replaces the contents of a legitimate process with malicious code. This already indicates a level of evasion.
   - Fileless techniques involve running malware in memory without writing any files to disk, which is another method of defense evasion, making it harder for traditional signature-based detection tools to identify the malware.
   - Given that Dexphot is already using process hollowing for defense evasion, and considering the nature of fileless techniques as an additional layer of evasion, it's plausible that Dexphot would also utilize fileless techniques to further prevent detection and obfuscate its activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of process hollowing as a defense evasion technique.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the potential for fileless techniques to enhance evasion capabilities.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the adversary's goal of remaining undetected and the complementary nature of fileless techniques to process hollowing.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the logical progression of evasion techniques, it is reasonable to conclude that Dexphot would likely utilize fileless techniques in addition to process hollowing for enhanced defense evasion.

Final Answer: A
