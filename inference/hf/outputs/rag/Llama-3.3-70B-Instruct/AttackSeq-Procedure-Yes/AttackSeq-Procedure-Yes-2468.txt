To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where an initial attack vector involves sending a PDF attachment that successfully bypasses security filters, appearing harmless. Following this, the attack evades detection by utilizing legitimate tools and scripts for its operations. The question asks if this sequence of events is likely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves the adversary disguising their malware or activities to make them appear as legitimate processes or files to evade detection. This can include using legitimate software or scripts to carry out malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves the adversary sending emails with attachments that contain malware, which the victim is tricked into opening, allowing the adversary to gain initial access to the system. The fact that the PDF attachment "passed through security filters and appeared benign" suggests a sophisticated approach to evade initial detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The described attack sequence starts with a spearphishing attachment (T1566.001) that evades initial security measures, which aligns with the initial access tactic.
   - The subsequent action of evading detection by using legitimate tools and scripts matches the defense evasion tactic, specifically masquerading (T1036).
   - The combination of these tactics and techniques suggests a multi-step approach to gain access and maintain presence within a system without being detected, which is a common and effective strategy used by adversaries.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial vector involves a PDF attachment that bypasses security, which is a common method for initial access (T1566.001).
   - **Step 2**: The use of legitimate tools and scripts for operations after initial access is a known defense evasion technique (T1036-Masquerading).
   - **Step 3**: Combining these steps creates a plausible attack sequence where an adversary gains initial access through a disguised attachment and then evades detection by blending in with normal system activity.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is indeed likely that the attack could initiate and proceed in the manner described.

Final Answer: A
