To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by TG-3279, starting with reconnaissance using open source research and network scanning. It then mentions cloning domain registration information from legitimate companies like Google or Microsoft, followed by gaining initial access using specific tools.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This involves gathering information about the target's network, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance activities described.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: This technique involves searching open technical databases for information, which can include domain registration details, aligning with the cloning of domain registration information mentioned.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: This involves obtaining and configuring domains for use in operations, which could include cloning domain registration information to masquerade as legitimate entities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence that starts with reconnaissance (aligned with T1590 and T1596), followed by an action that could be interpreted as resource development through cloning domain registration information (aligned with T1583.001), and finally gaining initial access.
   - The use of tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets suggests a progression from reconnaissance to exploitation, which is a logical sequence in a cyber attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Reconnaissance is conducted via open source research and network scanning, which aligns with the provided TTPs (T1590 and T1596).
   - **Step 2**: The cloning of domain registration information from legitimate companies can be seen as a form of resource development (T1583.001), where the attacker prepares resources (in this case, domain information) for later use, potentially for phishing, spear phishing, or other social engineering tactics to gain initial access.
   - **Step 3**: The use of specific tools for scanning and exploiting targets indicates an attempt to gain initial access, which follows the reconnaissance and resource development phases.
   - Given the logical progression from reconnaissance, through resource development (including cloning domain information), to exploiting targets for initial access, the sequence described in the question seems plausible based on the related TTPs provided.

**Final Answer: A**
