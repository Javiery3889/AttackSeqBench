To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware has already executed a command to gather system information and process lists using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`. This action is related to the discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker or malware is gathering information about the target system. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication for its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP or HTTPS) for communication between the malware and its command and control server. This technique is commonly used because it can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This is related to the initial action described in the question, where the malware is discovering information about running processes on the system. This technique helps attackers understand the system's landscape, which can inform their next steps, including potential communication methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already engaged in discovery activities (gathering system and process information), the next logical steps could involve establishing a means of command and control to further exploit the system or exfiltrate data.
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 operations (T1071.001) is a common practice due to its encrypted nature, which makes it more difficult for defenders to intercept and analyze the communication. This aligns well with the post-discovery phase activities, where stealth and persistence are key.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has performed initial discovery, indicating it's in the process of gathering information necessary for further exploitation.
   - **Step 2**: For the malware to effectively communicate with its C2 server without being easily detected, using encrypted web protocols like HTTPS is a logical choice.
   - **Step 3**: Given the common use of HTTPS for C2 communications due to its stealthiness and the fact that the malware has already shown an interest in system discovery, it's reasonable to assume that HTTPS could be used for C2 operations.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, it's plausible that the malware would use HTTPS for its command and control operations following the discovery phase.

Final Answer: A
