To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after gaining initial access through zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks, the Elderwood Project attackers would likely establish command and control (C&C) servers. This involves understanding the context of the Elderwood Project, which is known for sophisticated cyber attacks, and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved in such operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control, which is a common method for attackers to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This refers to gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, which aligns with the use of zero-day exploits in watering hole attacks mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication that allows both the attacker and the compromised system to send and receive data, which is crucial for maintaining control and executing further malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes an initial access method (watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits) and asks about the likelihood of establishing C&C servers.
   - The related TTPs provide context on how initial access can be gained (T1189) and how command and control can be maintained (T1071.001 and T1102.002).
   - Establishing C&C servers is a common next step after initial access to maintain control, receive commands, and execute further attacks. The techniques T1071.001 and T1102.002 directly support this capability.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have gained initial access, which is a precursor to needing command and control.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs show that command and control techniques are relevant and likely to be used after initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of the Elderwood Project and the described TTPs, it is logical that establishing C&C servers would follow initial access to maintain control and facilitate further malicious activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the typical progression of cyber attacks, it is likely that the attackers would establish C&C servers.

Final Answer: A
