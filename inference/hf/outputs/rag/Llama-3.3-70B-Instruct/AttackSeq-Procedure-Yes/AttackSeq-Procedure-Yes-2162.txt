To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT35 (a known advanced persistent threat group) gains initial access to a corporate device via a spear phishing email. This is a common initial access tactic used by various threat actors, including APT groups. The question then asks if it's likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would automate the investigation process following the detection of Command and Control (C2) activity on the infected device.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the Initial Access tactic, specifically focusing on phishing techniques. 
   - **T1566: Phishing** is the general technique of using social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions.
   - **T1566.002: Spearphishing Link** involves sending a link to a malicious website via email to trick the recipient into clicking it.
   - **T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment** involves sending an email with a malicious attachment to trick the recipient into opening it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: The question mentions the use of a spear phishing email for initial access, which aligns with the provided TTPs. After gaining access, the next steps in an attack often involve establishing Command and Control (C2) channels to maintain access and potentially move laterally within the network. The detection of C2 activity is a critical step in incident response. Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is a tool designed to automate the investigation process of cyber threats, including analyzing devices infected during the initial access phase and detecting C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT35 uses spear phishing for initial access, which is a known and documented TTP.
   - The initial access phase is followed by other tactics, including establishing C2 channels.
   - Detection of C2 activity triggers the need for investigation.
   - Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is designed to automate the investigation of such threats.

Given the context and the capabilities of Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst, it is reasonable to conclude that after detecting C2 activity following an initial access event like the one described, the tool would indeed automate the investigation process to analyze the infected device.

**Final Answer: A**
