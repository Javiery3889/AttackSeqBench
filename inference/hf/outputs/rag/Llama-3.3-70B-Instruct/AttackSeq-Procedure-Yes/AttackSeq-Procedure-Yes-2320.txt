To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Shamoon malware has already executed a copy of itself as a scheduled job and has dropped a driver for disk access. The question is asking whether, given these actions, it is likely that the malware will overwrite the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic.

2. **Understanding Shamoon Malware**: Shamoon is known for its destructive capabilities, including overwriting data on infected machines. Overwriting the VBR is a technique that could be used for defense evasion or to cause impact, as it can make recovery of the system more difficult.

3. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**: This technique involves using a bootkit to hide malware from the operating system. Overwriting the VBR could be part of installing a bootkit, as it allows the malware to load before the operating system, potentially hiding its presence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.006-Timestomp**: This involves modifying file timestamps to evade detection. While related to defense evasion, it doesn't directly imply modification of the VBR.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**: This technique involves wiping disk structures, which could include overwriting the VBR, but is categorized under "Impact" rather than "Defense Evasion".

4. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question specifically asks about overwriting the VBR as a Defense Evasion tactic. While overwriting the VBR could serve both defense evasion (by installing a bootkit) and impact (by causing damage), the provided TTPs suggest that such an action could indeed be part of the malware's behavior, especially considering Shamoon's known destructive capabilities.
   - The presence of T1542.003-Bootkit as a related TTP suggests that modifying boot processes is within the scope of the malware's tactics, which could include overwriting the VBR for defense evasion purposes.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that Shamoon malware has already demonstrated capabilities that involve modifying system structures for its execution and persistence.
   - The related TTPs indicate that modifying boot processes (which could include overwriting the VBR) is a plausible action for defense evasion.
   - Therefore, considering the malware's behavior and the provided TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that overwriting the VBR could be part of its tactics for defense evasion.

Final Answer: A
