To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial access scenario where APT28 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access to a system. After gaining access, a dropper is executed to further compromise the system. The question then asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to initial access tactics, specifically:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** - This is about how an adversary gains initial access to a system or network.
   - **Technique: T1566-Phishing** - This involves tricking a user into disclosing sensitive information or performing a certain action.
   - **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - A specific type of phishing that involves sending emails with malicious attachments to specific, targeted individuals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the initial access methods described (spear phishing with malicious attachments and the use of a dropper), we're looking at how APT28 might proceed after gaining access. The question hints at a broader, more complex operation involving geographically distributed bots reporting back to a central server, which aligns with behaviors often seen in the discovery phase of an attack, where an adversary seeks to understand the network layout, identify valuable assets, and possibly expand their foothold.

   The use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process would be consistent with an advanced threat actor like APT28, which is known for sophisticated and coordinated attacks. This behavior would help in evading detection, distributing command and control (C2) communications, and gathering intelligence on the target network from multiple vantage points.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access methods used by APT28, which are spear phishing with malicious attachments and the execution of a dropper.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the context of the related TTPs, which focus on initial access through phishing techniques.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the behaviors of APT28 and the purpose of using geographically distributed bots in the context of network discovery and command and control.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of APT28 employing such tactics given their known sophistication and goals in network compromise and intelligence gathering.

Given the sophistication of APT28 and the tactics described, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access, APT28 would likely utilize advanced methods for network discovery and command and control, including the use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server.

Final Answer: A
