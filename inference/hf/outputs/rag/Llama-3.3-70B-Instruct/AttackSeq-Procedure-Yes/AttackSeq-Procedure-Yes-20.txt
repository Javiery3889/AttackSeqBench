To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after establishing persistence (likely through creating scheduled tasks and placing malicious files in specific directories), is considering actions during the collection phase. The collection phase in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves gathering information that can be used for future operations. The question specifically asks if "Machete" (presumably a piece of malware or an attacker's tool) is likely to capture audio from the computer's microphone and copy files to a special USB device during this phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives. This could align with the action of copying files to a special USB device.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1123-Audio Capture**: This technique involves capturing audio from the target, which could be through the computer's microphone. This directly aligns with capturing audio as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the collection phase and the specific techniques mentioned (T1025 and T1123), both actions described in the question (capturing audio from the computer's microphone and copying files to a special USB device) are plausible within the collection tactic. The technique T1123 directly supports the action of capturing audio, and T1025 supports the action of interacting with removable media, which could include copying files to a USB device.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines actions that align with the collection phase of an attack.
   - The related TTPs (T1025 and T1123) directly support the possibility of both capturing audio and interacting with removable media.
   - Given the context and the specific techniques mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that "Machete" could indeed perform these actions as part of the collection phase.
   
Final Answer: A
