To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor function is used for collecting machine information and taking screenshots, which aligns with the Discovery and Collection tactics. It then asks if it's likely that the backdoor will communicate with the Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels. This technique involves using multiple, potentially different, communication channels to issue commands to and receive data from a compromised system. This can include the use of encrypted channels to hide the communication.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture. This technique involves capturing screenshots to gather information about the system or the user's activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a backdoor for collecting machine information and taking screenshots (as described in the question) fits within the Collection tactic, aligning with T1113-Screen Capture.
   - The question then shifts focus to the Command and Control phase, where the backdoor's communication with the C&C server is in question. Given the technique T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, it's plausible that an attacker would use encrypted channels as part of their command and control strategy to evade detection. Encrypted communication can be part of a multi-stage channel approach, making the command and control traffic more difficult to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial actions (collecting machine information and taking screenshots) are consistent with the Collection tactic.
   - **Step 2**: The question then moves to the Command and Control phase, where secure communication is crucial for the attacker to maintain access without being detected.
   - **Step 3**: Given the TTPs, especially T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, it's reasonable to infer that an attacker would use encrypted channels for communication with the C&C server to avoid detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, it is likely that the backdoor would communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase to maintain stealth and ensure continued access to the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
