To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where spear phishing activities are used, targeting the ASEAN region, with a decoy document suspected to be stolen for reconnaissance. It then asks if it's likely that the spear phishing document will exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to drop malicious components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll) for achieving initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. Exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office, fits this technique as it can lead to code execution when a user opens a malicious document.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content, aiming to gain initial access to a system. The scenario described in the question matches this technique, as it involves using a spear phishing attachment (the decoy document) for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a scenario that starts with spear phishing (T1566.001) and involves exploiting a vulnerability (which aligns with T1203) to drop malicious components. The exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 to drop wab.exe and wab32res.dll is a plausible next step after the initial spear phishing attachment is opened, as it would allow the attackers to achieve initial access and potentially execute further malicious code.
   - The use of a decoy document for reconnaissance followed by the exploitation of a known vulnerability for client execution is a common attack pattern. The specific vulnerability mentioned (CVE-2012-0158) is a real vulnerability that has been used in the past for malicious purposes, including dropping malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The question describes a spear phishing campaign with a decoy document, which aligns with T1566.001 for initial access.
   - **Step 2**: The exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components like wab.exe and wab32res.dll fits the T1203 technique for client execution, which is a plausible next step after initial access is gained.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the related TTPs, the scenario described in the question is a feasible attack sequence.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, it is likely that the spear phishing document could exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components for achieving initial access, as this aligns with known attack patterns and the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A
