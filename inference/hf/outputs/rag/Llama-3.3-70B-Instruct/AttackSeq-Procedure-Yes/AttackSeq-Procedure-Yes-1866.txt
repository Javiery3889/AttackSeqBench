To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands. It then asks if it's likely that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple, sequential communication channels to control a compromised system. This could involve an initial stage that contacts a control server to download additional malware.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using DDE to execute malicious commands, which aligns with the initial part of the scenario described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands (T1559.002) is a method of executing malicious code on a victim's system.
   - The mention of a multi-stage command and control operation (T1104) suggests a sequence of actions where the initial stage (in this case, potentially the execution of encoded commands via DDE) is followed by further communication with a control server to distribute additional malware, such as the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - Given that the Seduploader malware is often used in the context of establishing a command and control channel and that multi-stage channels involve sequential communication for controlling a compromised system, it is plausible that after the initial execution of malicious code, the next step would involve contacting a control server for further instructions or to download additional malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker uses DDE to execute malicious commands, which is a known technique for initial execution.
   - **Step 2**: The scenario involves a multi-stage command and control operation, which typically includes contacting a control server for further instructions or to download additional malware.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of multi-stage operations and the use of DDE for initial execution, it is logical that the malicious document would facilitate communication with a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the tactics and techniques provided, the most plausible sequence involves the malicious document contacting a control server after the initial execution of malicious code.

Final Answer: A
