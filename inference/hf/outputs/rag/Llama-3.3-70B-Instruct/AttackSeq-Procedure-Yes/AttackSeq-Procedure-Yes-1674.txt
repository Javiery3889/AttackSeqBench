To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that attackers would use the SocGholish framework, delivered through compromised legitimate websites, as a means of initial compromise. Following this initial compromise, the attackers would then use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery. This involves understanding the role of SocGholish in initial access and the use of PowerView in discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This TTP is about discovering systems on a network, which aligns with the use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView. PowerView is a tool used for network exploration and can be used to gather information about computers on the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This TTP involves gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, where a user visits a compromised website that exploits vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins to execute malicious code. The SocGholish framework is known for being delivered via compromised websites, fitting this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The SocGholish framework is used for initial access, specifically through drive-by compromises (T1189), which matches the first part of the question.
   - The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is used for remote system discovery (T1018), aligning with the second part of the question.
   - The sequence described in the question (initial compromise via SocGholish delivered by compromised websites, followed by remote system discovery using PowerView) is a plausible attack sequence because it follows a logical progression from gaining initial access to exploring the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - SocGholish framework delivered via compromised websites, which is a known method for drive-by compromises.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the purpose of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView, which is for remote system discovery.
   - **Step 3**: Determine if the sequence is plausible based on the TTPs provided. Given that the initial access method (SocGholish) aligns with T1189 and the subsequent action (using PowerView) aligns with T1018, the sequence is logical and follows a typical attack pattern of gaining access and then exploring the network.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is a plausible attack sequence because it aligns with known tactics and techniques used by attackers.

Final Answer: A
