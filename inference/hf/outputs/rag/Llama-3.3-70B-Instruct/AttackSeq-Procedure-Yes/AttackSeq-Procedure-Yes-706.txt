To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether APT12, after deploying updated malware versions (Aumlib and Ixeshe), is likely to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe traffic as part of defense evasion before establishing command and control connections. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that APT12 might employ, specifically in the context of command and control (C2) and defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This indicates the use of standard encoding schemes to hide or obscure C2 communications. Encoding is a common technique used by adversaries to make their communications less detectable by security tools.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This involves using encryption or encoding on files to avoid detection. This technique is used by adversaries to hide malicious files or data, making it harder for security software to detect them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The question mentions encoding the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and using a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic. This directly relates to using encoding as a method for defense evasion and potentially for command and control communications.
   - The use of encoding (as in T1132.001) for C2 communications and encoding files (as in T1027.013) for defense evasion aligns with the behaviors described in the question. Encoding data, such as the HTTP POST body, and using specific encoding patterns like Base64, are standard practices for hiding malicious communications and evading detection.
   - Given that APT12 is deploying updated malware versions, it is reasonable to assume they would employ such tactics to maintain stealth and ensure the longevity of their campaign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of the question, focusing on the deployment of updated malware and the tactics involved in defense evasion and command and control.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the related TTPs to recognize the relevance of encoding in both defense evasion and command and control.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate how the described actions (encoding HTTP POST bodies and using different Base64 encoding patterns) fit within the known TTPs of using standard encoding for C2 and encoding files for defense evasion.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the context provided by the related TTPs, it is logical to conclude that APT12 would indeed attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic as part of their defense evasion tactics before connecting to specific URLs for command and control.

Final Answer: A
