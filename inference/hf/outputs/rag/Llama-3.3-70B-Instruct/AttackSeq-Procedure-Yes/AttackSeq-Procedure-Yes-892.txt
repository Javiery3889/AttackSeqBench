To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, has already gained initial access through spear-phishing campaigns aimed at harvesting credentials. It then asks if it's likely that APT28 would exploit known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers to move deeper into the victim's network during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This indicates that exploiting remote services is a method used for lateral movement. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers can be considered a form of exploiting remote services.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to maintain persistence within a network. While related to credential access, it doesn't directly address the method of lateral movement through vulnerability exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This shows that valid accounts can be used for initial access, which aligns with the spear-phishing campaign mentioned for credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that APT28 has already obtained valid credentials through spear-phishing, they could potentially use these credentials for lateral movement (as indicated by T1078-Valid Accounts under Lateral Movement, though not directly listed, it's a plausible extension given the initial access method).
   - However, the question specifically asks about exploiting known vulnerabilities to move deeper into the network. The related TTP T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services directly supports this action as a method for lateral movement.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers is a common tactic for initial access but can also be used for lateral movement, especially if the initial access was gained through a different vector (like spear-phishing) and the attackers are looking to expand their foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - APT28 has gained initial access through spear-phishing, obtaining credentials.
   - The group is looking to move laterally within the network.
   - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) is a plausible method for lateral movement, especially considering it's a tactic that can be used after initial access has been established through other means.
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT28 would use such tactics to deepen their access within the victim's network.

Final Answer: A
