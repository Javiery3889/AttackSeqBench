To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer for details like the victim's name and system information before establishing command and control (C2) communication. This surveying or gathering of information is a common practice among malware to understand the environment they are operating in, which can help in deciding the next steps of the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP indicates that the adversary is interested in gathering system information. System Information Discovery involves collecting information about the system, which can include details such as the operating system version, hardware, and other system-specific details. This technique is often used to plan further operations, such as determining the appropriate payloads or exploits to use.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This TTP refers to the use of symmetric encryption (in this case, AES in CBC mode) for C2 communication. Symmetric cryptography is used for encrypting data with the same key used for decryption, providing confidentiality and integrity of the communication between the malware and its C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: first, gathering system information, and then establishing encrypted C2 communication.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence. **T1082-System Information Discovery** aligns with the initial action of surveying the victim's computer, which would logically precede the establishment of C2 communication. This is because understanding the victim's system can help in customizing the attack or in deciding how to proceed with the C2 communication securely.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** supports the method of C2 communication mentioned in the question, indicating that after gathering necessary information, the malware would use a secure method to communicate with its server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The OceanLotus backdoor's actions, as described, fit a common pattern of malware behavior where initial reconnaissance (gathering system information) is followed by more targeted actions, such as establishing secure communication with a C2 server.
   - Given the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed survey the victim's computer before initiating C2 communication to gather necessary details for transmission to its server.
   - This behavior is consistent with the tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the Discovery tactic for gathering system information and the Command and Control tactic for secure communication.

Final Answer: A
