To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the XAgent app, which is executing on iOS 7 devices. It mentions the app's ability to hide its icon, run in the background, and restart after being terminated. The question then inquires about the likelihood of the XAgent app collecting geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and sending this data to its Command and Control (C&C) server via HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to two main tactics:
   - **Exfiltration**: This involves the removal of data from a system or network without being detected. The specific technique mentioned is T1041, Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which refers to the act of sending data from a compromised system to the attacker's C&C server.
   - **Discovery**: This tactic involves the gathering of information about the target system or network. The technique T1082, System Information Discovery, refers to the collection of information about the system, which could include a wide range of data such as hardware, software, configuration, and potentially geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the XAgent app is described as executing in a stealthy manner and the mention of it potentially collecting geo-location data, we can infer that the app is likely engaged in information gathering activities. Geo-location data would fall under system or device information, which aligns with the Discovery tactic, specifically System Information Discovery (T1082). The fact that it sends collected data to its C&C server via HTTP aligns with the Exfiltration tactic, specifically Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The XAgent app's behavior of hiding its icon, running in the background, and restarting after termination suggests it is designed to operate stealthily and persist on the device.
   - The collection of geo-location data as part of its discovery routine fits within the context of System Information Discovery (T1082), as geo-location can be considered a piece of system or device information.
   - The act of sending the collected data to its C&C server via HTTP matches the description of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041).
   - Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is plausible that the XAgent app would collect geo-location data and send it to its C&C server as part of its operation.

Final Answer: A
