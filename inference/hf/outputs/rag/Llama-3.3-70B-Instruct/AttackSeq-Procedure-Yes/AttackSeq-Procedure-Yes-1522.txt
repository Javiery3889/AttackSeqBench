To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code. It then asks if it's likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

   These TTPs indicate that the attackers are likely using techniques to evade detection, specifically by smuggling HTML (which could include Javascript) and obfuscating files or information to hide their malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions modifying a Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer, which is a tool known for compressing and encoding Javascript, making it harder for security software to detect the malicious code.
   - The technique T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information directly relates to making files or information unintelligible to prevent detection, which aligns with the use of Dean Edwards Packer for encoding malicious Javascript.
   - While T1027.006-HTML Smuggling is about evading defenses by disguising malicious code within HTML, the primary focus of the question is on the obfuscation of the appended malicious code within a Javascript file, not necessarily smuggling HTML.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers' goal, as described, is to deliver malicious code without being detected, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Modifying an existing Javascript file and encoding the malicious part with Dean Edwards Packer fits the description of obfuscating files or information (T1027) to evade detection.
   - Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers would use such methods to hide their malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
