To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers, after ensuring their malware evades detection by security software, proceed to collect system information and capture screenshots from infected machines. This is specifically mentioned to be under the SLUB variant, and the collected information is then exfiltrated to a Mattermost server. The question asks if this sequence of actions is likely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Collection tactic. 
   - **T1005: Data from Local System** refers to the technique of collecting data from the local system, which could include system information such as configuration, files, or other data stored on the system.
   - **T1113: Screen Capture** refers to the technique of capturing screenshots of the desktop or specific windows, which can reveal sensitive information such as open documents, chat windows, or other visible data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the question, the attackers' goal seems to be gathering as much information as possible from the infected machines. The techniques T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1113 (Screen Capture) directly support this goal by allowing the attackers to collect system information and capture screenshots, respectively. This aligns with the Collection tactic, which is about gathering information that can be used for various purposes, including espionage, further exploitation, or identity theft.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers are trying to evade detection, indicating they are attempting to remain stealthy and gather information without being noticed.
   - The use of T1005 (Data from Local System) and T1113 (Screen Capture) fits within the Collection tactic, which is about gathering information.
   - Exfiltrating this information to a Mattermost server suggests the attackers are looking to collect and potentially analyze this data for future operations or intelligence gathering.
   - Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is logical that after evading detection, the attackers would proceed to collect as much information as possible from the infected machines.

Final Answer: A
