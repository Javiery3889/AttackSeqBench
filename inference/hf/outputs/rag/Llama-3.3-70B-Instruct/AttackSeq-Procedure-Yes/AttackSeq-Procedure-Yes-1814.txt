To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, referred to as Earth Wendigo, has already gained persistence in a webmail system. This persistence was achieved by injecting malicious code into the system's shortcut feature and registering malicious JavaScript to the Service Worker script. The question then asks if it's likely that Earth Wendigo would evade detection by hiding malicious code inside CSS elements and leveraging the webmail system's search suggestion function for script execution.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Execution) and a technique (T1059.007 - JavaScript). This indicates that the attacker is utilizing JavaScript for execution, which is a common method for executing malicious code in web-based environments.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Hiding malicious code inside CSS elements**: While CSS is primarily used for styling, it can be used to hide or obfuscate malicious code, especially when combined with JavaScript. This could potentially be a method for evading detection, as security tools might not always thoroughly inspect CSS for malicious code.
    - **Leveraging the webmail system's search suggestion function for script execution**: This could be a novel way to execute scripts, especially if the webmail system's search function can be manipulated to run JavaScript. Given that the attacker has already shown the ability to inject and execute JavaScript, using a less common vector like the search suggestion function could indeed be a method to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The attacker has already demonstrated the capability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript within the webmail system.
    - The use of novel or less common methods (like hiding code in CSS or leveraging the search suggestion function) could potentially evade detection, as these might not be as heavily monitored or filtered by security measures.
    - The provided TTPs support the use of JavaScript for execution, which aligns with the methods described in the question for evading detection.

Given the information and analysis, it seems plausible that Earth Wendigo could evade detection by employing these tactics, as they align with the execution tactic and the use of JavaScript for malicious purposes.

**Final Answer: A**
