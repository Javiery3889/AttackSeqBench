To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze them in the context of the provided Related TTPs.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of actions taken by malware. It starts with the delivery of malware via a compressed file ('Thu moi.7z') containing an HTA (HTML Application) file ('Thumoi.hta'). This HTA file executes a VB (Visual Basic) script, which drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word file. The question then asks if, after these initial steps, the malware is likely to create a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file. This execution would occur after the malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename in hexadecimal format and a '.tmp' extension.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of malicious files to gain execution. Malicious files can be used in various ways, including being dropped and executed by other malicious components.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) for execution. VB scripts can be used to execute system commands, drop and execute files, and perform other malicious activities.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The initial steps described (delivery via 'Thu moi.7z', execution of 'Thumoi.hta', and the use of a VB script to drop and open a decoy file) align with techniques used for malicious execution, such as T1204.002 and T1059.005.
   - The action of rewriting the malware to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename and '.tmp' extension is a common tactic to evade detection and persist on the system.
   - Creating a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file after these steps would be consistent with the tactics of executing malicious files (T1204.002) and using scripts for execution (T1059.005), as it involves executing a malicious component to further the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware is delivered and executes an HTA file, which runs a VB script. This aligns with T1059.005.
   - **Step 2**: The VB script drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word file, which could be part of a social engineering tactic to distract the user while the malware performs other actions.
   - **Step 3**: The malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename and '.tmp' extension, a common evasion technique.
   - **Step 4**: Given the context and the techniques involved (T1204.002 and T1059.005), it is plausible that the malware would create a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file as part of its execution tactic.
   
**Final Answer: A**
