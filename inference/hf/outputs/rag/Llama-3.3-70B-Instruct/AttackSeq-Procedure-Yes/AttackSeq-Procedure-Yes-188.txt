To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after gaining access to a system (possibly through the use of tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access), is considering the next steps. These steps include enumerating system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery, and then automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services. The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to perform these actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**. This indicates the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, with the technique **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**. This involves the attacker exploring the file system and directories of the compromised system to gather information about the system's structure and content.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question mentions the use of tcpdump for Credential Access, which implies the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system.
   - The action of enumerating system data directories and GPS information aligns with **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**, which is a technique used for the Discovery tactic. This action would help the attacker understand the layout and content of the system, potentially identifying valuable data for exfiltration.
   - The use of Tor hidden services for automatic exfiltration of collected files matches the **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** technique under the Exfiltration tactic. This method would allow the attacker to secretly and automatically transfer stolen data out of the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already accessed the system using tcpdump for Credential Access.
   - **Step 2**: To maximize the value of their access, the attacker would logically want to explore the system (Discovery) to find valuable data. Enumerating system data directories and GPS information fits this goal.
   - **Step 3**: After identifying valuable data, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data. Using Tor hidden services for automated exfiltration (as described) aligns with known tactics for secretly removing data from a compromised system.

Given the logical progression from accessing a system, to exploring it for valuable data, and then exfiltrating that data, and considering the provided TTPs, it seems plausible that Infamous Chisel would indeed follow this sequence to achieve their goals.

**Final Answer: A**
