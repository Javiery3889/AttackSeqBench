To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app, after executing and hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices, potentially collects a list of processes and then sends this information to a Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP. The key actions here are the collection of process information and the exfiltration of this data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. Exfiltration refers to the act of transferring data from a system without authorization, often to an external entity or server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This involves the collection of information about running processes on a system. Process discovery can be used for various purposes, including identifying potential targets for further exploitation or understanding the system's security posture.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the techniques mentioned, **T1057-Process Discovery** aligns with the action of collecting a list of processes. This would be a logical step for an adversary to understand the environment they are operating in.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** supports the notion of sending gathered information (in this case, process data) out to a C2 server automatically, which fits the description of sending data via HTTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The XAgent app's behavior of hiding its icon and running in the background suggests it is designed to operate stealthily, which is consistent with malicious intent.
   - Collecting a list of processes (T1057-Process Discovery) would be a reasonable step for an adversary to take after gaining access to a system, as it helps in understanding the system's current state and potential vulnerabilities.
   - The use of automated exfiltration (T1020) to send this data to a C2 server via HTTP is a plausible next step, as it allows the adversary to receive the collected information without further interaction.
   - Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is logical that after executing and establishing a presence on the iOS device, the XAgent app would engage in process discovery followed by the exfiltration of the gathered data.

Final Answer: A
