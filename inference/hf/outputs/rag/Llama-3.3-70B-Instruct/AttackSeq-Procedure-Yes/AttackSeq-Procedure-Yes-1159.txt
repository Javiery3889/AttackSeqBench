To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where PROMETHIUM, presumably a type of malware, is involved in the Collection phase of an attack. During this phase, it searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will encode these archives with an unusual scheme, split them into chunks, and exfiltrate them to a Command and Control (C2) server during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This indicates that the attacker is archiving the collected data, which aligns with the initial action of compressing Microsoft Office files into archives.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This suggests that the attacker might use non-standard or custom methods for archiving, which could include encoding the archives with an unusual scheme.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves transferring data in a way that avoids detection by adhering to size limits, which could be achieved by splitting the archives into chunks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a custom archiving method (T1560.003) implies that the attacker is capable of and willing to use non-standard techniques for handling collected data. Encoding archives with an unusual scheme fits within this capability.
   - The need to adhere to data transfer size limits (T1030) during exfiltration suggests that splitting the archives into chunks would be a plausible action to avoid detection, especially if the archives are large.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker is archiving collected data, which includes compressing Microsoft Office files.
   - **Step 2**: The attacker uses custom methods for archiving, which could include encoding with an unusual scheme.
   - **Step 3**: To exfiltrate the data without detection, the attacker must consider data transfer size limits.
   - **Step 4**: Splitting the archives into chunks and potentially encoding them with an unusual scheme would facilitate stealthy exfiltration.
   
Given the techniques described and the tactics involved, it is reasonable to conclude that after collecting and archiving data, the malware would indeed take steps to encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks to facilitate undetected exfiltration to the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
