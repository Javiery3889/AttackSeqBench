To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether RIG EK (Exploit Kit) is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page, after using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtaining capabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This indicates the use of malicious advertisements to deliver malware or redirect users to malicious sites. It's a method used by attackers to expand their reach and compromise more systems.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This involves using malicious links to execute code on a victim's system. While related to the execution phase, it's more about the method of executing malicious code rather than the initial access or redirection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system by having a user visit a malicious website or click on a malicious link that exploits a vulnerability in the user's browser or associated plugins. This is a common method used by exploit kits like RIG EK to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - RIG EK is known for exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers and plugins to compromise systems. The use of malvertising (T1583.008) as a technique aligns with how exploit kits can be deliveredâ€”by redirecting users to malicious sites or landing pages through compromised or malicious advertisements.
   - The question mentions using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands, which aligns with the drive-by compromise technique (T1189). This is a typical method for exploit kits to gain initial access.
   - The mention of obtaining capabilities after executing commands suggests that the exploit kit is successful in its initial compromise phase and is looking to further establish its presence or deliver additional payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understanding that RIG EK uses browser vulnerabilities for initial access (T1189) and can use malvertising for redirection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognizing that malvertising (T1583.008) can be a precursor to redirecting users to a landing page where the exploit kit is hosted.
   - **Step 3**: Considering the tactics and techniques provided, the use of malvertising as a means to redirect users to the exploit kit's landing page before delivering the exploit is a plausible sequence of events.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the tactics/techniques involved, it is reasonable to conclude that RIG EK could indeed use malvertising to redirect users to its landing page as part of its operation.

Final Answer: A
