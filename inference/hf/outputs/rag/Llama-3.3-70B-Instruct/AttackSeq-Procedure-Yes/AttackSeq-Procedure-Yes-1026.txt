To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably using Gamaredon's malware, has already gained some level of access to a system. They have used malicious macros for persistence and have utilized a backdoor to list interesting files, such as Office documents, during the discovery phase. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will then scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, which is about gathering information that can be used for future operations.
   - **Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**, which involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, which involves gaining knowledge about the system and its components.
   - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**, which is used to discover files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the attacker has already shown interest in discovering and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data (as indicated by listing interesting files like Office documents), and considering the TTPs provided, it's logical to assume that scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data would be a next step. This action aligns with the **Collection** tactic and specifically the **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** technique. The fact that they are using a backdoor to list files suggests they are in the process of gathering information, which would naturally extend to collecting data from accessible network shared drives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already demonstrated an interest in discovering and potentially collecting sensitive data.
   - The use of malicious macros for persistence and a backdoor for discovery indicates a sophisticated approach to gaining and maintaining access to the system.
   - The TTPs provided support the idea that collecting data from network shared drives is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
   - Therefore, given the context and the TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

Final Answer: A
