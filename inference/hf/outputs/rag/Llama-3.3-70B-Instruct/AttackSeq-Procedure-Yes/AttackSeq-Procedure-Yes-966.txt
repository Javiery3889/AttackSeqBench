To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the Naikon APT group, after using the Aria-body backdoor for discovery, is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communications.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port. This technique involves using non-standard ports, which could be over TCP or other protocols, for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of HTTP and TCP protocols aligns with the technique T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is specifically about using web protocols for command and control. This suggests that using HTTP (which typically runs over TCP) for sending collected data and listening for commands is a plausible action during the Command and Control stage.
   - The mention of TCP protocols also aligns with the broader use of network protocols for command and control, which could include non-standard ports as mentioned in T1571. However, the specific question about using HTTP and TCP for command and control purposes is more directly addressed by T1071.001.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Step 1: Identify the relevance of T1071.001 to the question. This technique directly involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control, which matches the question's context.
   - Step 2: Consider the role of TCP in command and control communications. TCP is a common protocol used for reliable communication, including web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS), making it a plausible choice for sending and receiving command and control data.
   - Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood based on the provided TTPs. Given that T1071.001 specifically mentions the use of web protocols for command and control, and considering TCP's role in facilitating such communications, it's reasonable to conclude that the Naikon APT group could use HTTP and TCP protocols for these purposes.
   - Conclusion: Based on the provided TTPs and the specifics of the question, the most plausible answer is that the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage.

Final Answer: A
