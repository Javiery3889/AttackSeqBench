To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has conducted reconnaissance activities, including gathering publicly available information and using active discovery methods. It then asks if it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics and Techniques (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, with **Technique: T1018 - Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering systems on the network that can be accessed remotely. It's part of the reconnaissance phase where attackers try to gather more information about the target network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, with **Technique: T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is used to discover the network connections of a system, which can help in understanding the network topology and identifying potential targets or paths for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where the initial steps of reconnaissance have been taken, and the attacker has managed to install a malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) through employee-enabled macro execution. 
   - The installation of such malware typically aims to establish a foothold within the target network, from which the attacker can conduct further malicious activities.
   - Establishing communication with C2 servers is a common next step for many types of malware, including implants like BlackEnergy 3, as it allows the attackers to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and potentially move laterally within the network.
   - The related TTPs (T1018 and T1049) indicate activities focused on discovery, which aligns with the initial phases of an attack but does not directly address the communication with C2 servers. However, these techniques can be part of the broader context of an attack where understanding the network is crucial for effective C2 communication and further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Reconnaissance activities, including gathering publicly available information and active discovery methods, are typical initial steps in a cyber attack.
   - **Step 2**: The use of employee-enabled macro execution to install malware like BlackEnergy 3 indicates a successful initial compromise.
   - **Step 3**: Malware such as BlackEnergy 3 is known for its capabilities in establishing C2 communications to facilitate further malicious activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack and the nature of the malware involved, it is reasonable to expect that after installation, BlackEnergy 3 would attempt to establish communication with C2 servers to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A
