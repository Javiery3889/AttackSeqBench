To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Packrat, initially gains access through phishing attacks and fake news organizations. Following this initial access, the question asks whether it is likely that Packrat would use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Remote Access Trojans (RATs) that are obfuscated with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper during execution. Additionally, it mentions the use of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1027.002 - Software Packing**: This technique involves using software packing to conceal malware, making it harder for security software to detect.
     - **Technique: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data or files unintelligible to prevent detection, which aligns with the use of obfuscation tools and techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of COTS RATs obfuscated with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper aligns with the **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information** technique, as it involves making the RATs less detectable.
   - The employment of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses directly relates to **T1027.002 - Software Packing**, as it involves packing software (in this case, malware) to evade detection.
   - Both techniques are under the **Defense Evasion** tactic, which is about evading detection and bypassing security controls, fitting the context of using obfuscated RATs and packing techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access methods (phishing and fake news organizations) suggest a sophisticated attacker who is capable of using various TTPs to achieve their goals.
   - **Step 2**: The use of COTS RATs obfuscated with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper and the employment of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques are specific methods that align with known defense evasion techniques (T1027 and T1027.002).
   - **Step 3**: Given that these methods are directly related to the provided TTPs under the Defense Evasion tactic, it indicates a likely sequence of actions for an attacker aiming to maintain access and evade detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the alignment with the Defense Evasion TTPs, it is plausible that Packrat would use such methods to bypass defenses after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
