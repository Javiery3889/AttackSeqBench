To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Machete malware has collected data through various means (stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media) and staged them in a temporary folder. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. 
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for communication with C2 servers.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative or fallback communication channels in case the primary method is detected or blocked.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of standard FTP and HTTP ports for C2 communication before implementing fallback channels. 
   - The related TTPs suggest that while file transfer protocols (T1071.002) could be used, the use of non-standard ports (T1571) is a common tactic to avoid detection. However, the question's focus is on the use of standard ports initially.
   - The implementation of fallback channels (T1008) implies that the primary method of communication might indeed be more conventional (like standard ports) before switching to less common methods to maintain stealth.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that the malware has already collected data and is looking to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that using standard FTP and HTTP ports is a common initial approach for simplicity and reliability, despite the risk of detection.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the use of fallback channels (T1008) suggests a strategy that might start with more straightforward communication methods before adapting to evade detection.
   - **Step 4**: Considering the tactics and techniques provided, the most plausible sequence involves initial communication via standard methods (like FTP and HTTP on standard ports) before moving to more evasive tactics like non-standard ports or other fallback channels.

**Final Answer: A**
