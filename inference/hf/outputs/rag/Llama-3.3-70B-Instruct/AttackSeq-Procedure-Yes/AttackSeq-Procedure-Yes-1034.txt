To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Emissary Panda, a known threat actor, exploits a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access to a network. After gaining access, they install webshells on SharePoint servers. The question then asks if it's likely that they would upload various tools and custom backdoors (like HyperBro) to execute commands before scanning the network for other vulnerable systems, specifically targeting systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application, which is a technique under the Initial Access tactic. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access to a network. The exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint, fits this description as it is a public-facing application.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Exploitation of Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: The initial action described in the question (exploiting CVE-2019-0604) aligns with this technique. After gaining initial access, threat actors often seek to establish a foothold, which can involve uploading tools and backdoors to facilitate further actions.
    - **Uploading Tools and Backdoors**: This action is consistent with establishing a foothold and preparing for further exploitation. Tools like HyperBro, mentioned in the question, could be used for execution (e.g., executing commands on the compromised system).
    - **Scanning for Vulnerable Systems**: After establishing a foothold, scanning the network for other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2017-0144) is a common next step. This allows the threat actor to identify potential targets for lateral movement or further exploitation within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The initial exploitation of a public-facing application (SharePoint) using CVE-2019-0604 is a known TTP for gaining initial access.
    - Uploading tools and backdoors (like HyperBro) after gaining access is a plausible next step for establishing a foothold and enabling further execution of commands.
    - Scanning the network for other vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2017-0144) is a logical subsequent action to identify additional targets for exploitation or lateral movement.

Given the sequence of actions described and the related TTPs, the scenario presented in the question aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors like Emissary Panda.

**Final Answer: A**
