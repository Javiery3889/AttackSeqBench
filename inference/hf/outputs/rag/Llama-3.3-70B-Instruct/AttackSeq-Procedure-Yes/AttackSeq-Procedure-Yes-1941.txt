To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Smooth Operator malware has established communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers. This communication is done over HTTPS, and the malware uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a second-stage payload using an HTTP GET request.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the malware uses web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for communication with its C2 servers. The use of HTTPS for initial communication suggests a preference for encrypted channels, possibly for stealth and security.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. Given that the C2 communication is established over HTTPS, it implies that exfiltration could also occur over this encrypted channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of HTTPS for C2 communication and a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation, indicating a level of sophistication in hiding the malware's activities.
   - The related TTPs suggest that web protocols (including HTTPS) are used for C2, and exfiltration can occur over the C2 channel.
   - The use of an HTTP GET request for exfiltration, as mentioned in the question, seems less likely given the initial use of HTTPS for C2 communication. HTTPS provides encryption, which is beneficial for hiding exfiltrated data, whereas an HTTP GET request would be unencrypted and potentially easier to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's initial use of HTTPS for C2 communication and custom encoding for obfuscation suggests a focus on stealth and security.
   - The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for both C2 and exfiltration, with a preference for using the established C2 channel for exfiltration.
   - Given the emphasis on encryption (HTTPS) for initial communication, switching to an unencrypted HTTP GET request for exfiltration seems inconsistent with the malware's apparent desire for stealth.
   - Therefore, based on the provided information and the related TTPs, it seems less likely that the malware would automatically exfiltrate data using an unencrypted HTTP GET request after establishing a secure, encrypted C2 channel.

Final Answer: B
