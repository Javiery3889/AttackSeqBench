To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT3 uses a zero-day vulnerability to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor via phishing emails. It also mentions GH0ST RAT, which is delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, communicating with an APT18 CnC (Command and Control) address. The question asks if it's likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses under these circumstances.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This involves gathering information about a target using email addresses, which could be part of the initial reconnaissance phase but isn't directly related to the communication methods of malware like backdoors or RATs (Remote Access Trojans).
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves using spearphishing with a link to gain initial access to a system. While relevant to how malware might be delivered, it doesn't directly address the communication methods of the malware post-infection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: Similar to the above, this involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access. Again, it's about the delivery method rather than the post-infection communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks about the behavior of the SHOTPUT backdoor and GH0ST RAT post-infection, specifically regarding their communication with CnC servers.
   - The related TTPs focus on initial access techniques, particularly those involving phishing, which is how these malware tools are delivered but not how they communicate after infection.
   - The key detail is understanding that if APT3 delivers SHOTPUT and it's designed to communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, and given that GH0ST RAT (delivered by a different group, APT18) communicates with its own CnC, the behavior of one doesn't necessarily influence the other in terms of communication protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the delivery method (phishing emails) and the actors involved (APT3 and APT18).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question is about post-infection behavior, specifically CnC communication.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that the TTPs provided relate to initial access, not post-infection communication.
   - **Step 4**: Consider that different malware (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT) from different actors might have different CnC communication methods, including the use of hardcoded addresses.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and focusing on the plausible sequence of TTPs regarding CnC communication, it's reasonable to assume that SHOTPUT could communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses independently of how GH0ST RAT behaves, as these are actions post-infection and specific to each malware's design.

Final Answer: A
