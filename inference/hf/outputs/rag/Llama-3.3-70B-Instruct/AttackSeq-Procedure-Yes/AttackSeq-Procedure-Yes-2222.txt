To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca, including initial access through spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks, followed by the deployment of the Cobalt Strike loader. It then inquires about the likelihood of using specific tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of "Discovery" and the technique of "T1046-Network Service Discovery". This indicates that the adversary is interested in discovering services running on the network, which is a common step after gaining initial access to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: 
   - The initial actions described (spear phishing, using malicious JavaScript, and deploying Cobalt Strike) are typical methods for gaining initial access and establishing a foothold within a network.
   - The deployment of Cobalt Strike, known for its capabilities in post-exploitation, suggests that the adversary is looking to further explore and interact with the compromised network.
   - The tools mentioned (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) are used for network service discovery, which aligns with the T1046 technique. These tools can help in identifying open ports, services running on those ports, and potentially vulnerable services that could be exploited further.
   - Given the context of the attack and the goal of the discovery phase, using such tools would be a logical next step for an adversary aiming to map the network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access methods used by Earth Lusca indicate a sophisticated approach to gaining a foothold in the target network.
   - **Step 2**: The use of Cobalt Strike suggests an intention to explore and further compromise the network.
   - **Step 3**: The discovery phase is crucial for understanding the network layout and identifying vulnerabilities, which aligns with the use of network service discovery tools.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs described, it is logical that Earth Lusca would use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase as part of their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
