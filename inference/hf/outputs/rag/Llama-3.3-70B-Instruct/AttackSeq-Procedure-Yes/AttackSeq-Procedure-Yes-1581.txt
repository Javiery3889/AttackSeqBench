To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze them in the context of the provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The T9000 malware gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 through an RTF (Rich Text Format) file. This aligns with the technique of exploiting vulnerabilities for client execution, which is categorized under the tactic of Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution). This step is about how the malware initially infects the system, which is a common entry point for many attacks.

2. **Execution and Sideload DLL**: After gaining access, the question suggests that the malware utilizes `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll` for subsequent execution. This action falls under the technique of DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002), which is a method used by attackers to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes. This technique is categorized under the Persistence tactic but is also relevant to the Execution tactic as it involves executing malicious code.

3. **Persistence**: The question mentions achieving persistence by either modifying registry keys or injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into `explorer.exe`. Modifying registry keys is a common technique for achieving persistence (though the specific technique isn't directly mentioned in the provided TTPs, it's a well-known method). Injecting a DLL into a process like `explorer.exe` is another method to maintain persistence and execute malicious code within the context of a legitimate process.

Given these steps and the related TTPs:

- The initial exploitation for client execution (T1203) aligns with the malware's initial access method.
- The use of `igfxtray.exe` to sideload `hccutils.dll` is a form of DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002), which is a technique that can be used for both execution and persistence purposes.
- The subsequent actions for achieving persistence, such as modifying registry keys or injecting a DLL into `explorer.exe`, are consistent with tactics aimed at maintaining access to the compromised system.

Considering these points, the sequence of events described in the question—exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access, using a legitimate process to sideload a malicious DLL, and then taking steps to achieve persistence—forms a plausible attack sequence. Therefore, it is likely that after gaining initial access, the T9000 malware would utilize `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll` as part of its execution and persistence strategy.
