To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, GreyEnergy, has gained initial access to a system using spearphishing emails and by exploiting public-facing web servers. It then asks if GreyEnergy is likely to use specific stealth techniques to evade detection, including selective module deployment, partial encryption of modules with AES-256, and running modules fileless in memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates the initial method used by the attacker to gain access, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, **Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This suggests that the attacker uses encryption or encoding to evade defenses, which is part of the stealth techniques mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sophisticated attack sequence starting with initial access methods (spearphishing and exploiting public-facing applications), which matches the first related TTP.
   - The use of stealth techniques such as pushing only selected modules to targets, partially encrypting these modules (using AES-256), and running them fileless in memory directly relates to defense evasion techniques. The specific mention of encrypting/encoding files (T1027.013) supports the plausibility of using encryption (like AES-256) as part of the attack.
   - Given the context of GreyEnergy's actions and the related TTPs, it's reasonable to infer that after gaining initial access, the attacker would employ advanced evasion techniques to maintain access and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access methods used by GreyEnergy, which are spearphishing and exploiting public-facing web servers. This matches the TTP for initial access.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the defense evasion techniques that could be employed post-initial access, including encryption and fileless execution, which aligns with the provided TTP for defense evasion.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the sophistication and goals of the attack. Advanced attackers often use selective deployment and encryption to evade detection and maintain access.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the context of the related TTPs, it is plausible that GreyEnergy would implement such stealth techniques to hinder analysis and detection after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
