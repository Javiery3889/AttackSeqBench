To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about whether Mustang Panda, after using a specific evasion technique (double extension trick) in a spearphishing campaign, is likely to use documents that connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses for communication. This implies a sequence of actions starting with evasion and potentially leading to establishing command and control over compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension**: This technique involves using double file extensions (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) to disguise the true nature of a file, potentially evading security controls that might block files based on their extensions.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending links via spearphishing emails that, when clicked, lead to malicious outcomes, such as downloading malware or revealing sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The use of the double extension trick (T1036.007) as part of a spearphishing campaign (T1566.002) suggests an attempt to evade defenses and trick users into executing malicious files or revealing sensitive information.
   - Establishing communication with C2 servers is a common next step after initial access, as it allows attackers to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and further compromise the network.
   - Given that Mustang Panda is known for sophisticated operations, using documents to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses aligns with typical post-exploitation tactics aimed at maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial tactic - Mustang Panda uses the double extension trick as part of a spearphishing campaign to evade defenses.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the purpose of the initial tactic - The goal is to trick users into executing malicious files, which could lead to establishing a foothold in the target network.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the next logical steps in the attack sequence - After gaining initial access, attackers typically seek to establish command and control to further their objectives.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of using documents for C2 communication - Given the context, it's plausible that Mustang Panda would use documents or other files as part of their strategy to communicate with C2 servers, as this is a common method for maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.
   
**Final Answer: A**
