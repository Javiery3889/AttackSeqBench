To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where ZoxPNG, presumably malware, uses the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion. It then asks if it's likely that ZoxPNG would establish contact with its Command and Control (C2) server via an initial HTTP GET request for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communications. This technique is commonly used by adversaries to communicate with compromised systems, as it blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This involves using a proxy to indirect command and control traffic, potentially to obscure the source of the traffic or to bypass network restrictions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that ZoxPNG is using the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings (related to T1090-Proxy), it suggests an attempt to utilize or manipulate the victim's proxy settings for its communication, possibly for evasion techniques.
   - The use of an initial HTTP GET request for establishing contact with the C2 server aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols, as HTTP GET requests are a common method for web-based command and control, allowing the malware to receive commands or updates from the C2 server while masquerading as regular web traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: ZoxPNG exploits proxy settings, which could be for the purpose of hiding its communications or bypassing security controls.
   - **Step 2**: The exploitation of proxy settings (T1090-Proxy) is followed by a need to establish command and control, for which using web protocols (T1071.001) is a common and effective method.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context, using an initial HTTP GET request for command and control purposes is a plausible next step, as it leverages common web traffic to hide malicious communications.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the scenario described, it is reasonable to conclude that after exploiting proxy settings for defense evasion, ZoxPNG would likely use an initial HTTP GET request to establish contact with its C2 server for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: A
