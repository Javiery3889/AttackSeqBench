To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lampion trojan has achieved persistence on a system. It mentions the creation of a .lnk file and a new VBS file to ensure execution at system startup. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server to send collected data using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols. This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communications.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003 - Mail Protocols. This technique involves using mail protocols (like SMTP, IMAP, and POP3) for command and control communications.

   Both techniques are related to using application layer protocols for command and control purposes, which aligns with the question's context of communicating with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the malware has established persistence and the provided TTPs involve using application layer protocols for command and control, it's reasonable to infer that the malware would use such protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This communication could involve sending collected data or receiving further instructions, which are common purposes of command and control communications in malware operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lampion trojan has achieved persistence, indicating it has a foothold on the system and can potentially collect data or await further instructions.
   - The creation of a .lnk file and a VBS file for execution at startup suggests the malware is designed to maintain access over time.
   - The related TTPs specifically mention the use of application layer protocols for command and control, which includes scenarios where malware would send collected data to a C2 server.
   - Given the context and the TTPs, it is logical to conclude that the malware would indeed communicate with a C2 server for command and control purposes, using an application layer protocol.

Final Answer: A
