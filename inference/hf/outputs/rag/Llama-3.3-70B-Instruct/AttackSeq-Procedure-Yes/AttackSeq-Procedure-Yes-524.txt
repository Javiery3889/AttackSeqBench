To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes the INOCNATION malware using various techniques for defense evasion, such as XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation. It then asks if, given these evasion techniques, the malware is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of standard web protocols for C2 communications, which can include HTTPS.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This refers to the use of asymmetric cryptography, which is a component of SSL/TLS connections for establishing secure, encrypted communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation by the INOCNATION malware suggests a sophisticated approach to evading detection.
   - For C2 communications, using encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections (which leverages asymmetric cryptography for the initial handshake) would be a logical step to maintain stealth and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.
   - The mentioned TTPs (T1071.001 and T1573.002) support the use of web protocols and asymmetric cryptography, respectively, which are integral to HTTPS communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's use of advanced evasion techniques suggests a need for secure C2 communications to avoid detection.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs indicate the use of web protocols and asymmetric cryptography, which are key components of HTTPS via SSL/TLS.
   - **Step 3**: Given the malware's sophisticated evasion techniques and the relevance of the TTPs to secure web communications, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would utilize encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections for C2 communications.
   - **Conclusion**: The use of encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections aligns with the malware's evasion strategies and the provided TTPs, making it likely for the INOCNATION malware to employ such methods for C2 communications.

Final Answer: A
