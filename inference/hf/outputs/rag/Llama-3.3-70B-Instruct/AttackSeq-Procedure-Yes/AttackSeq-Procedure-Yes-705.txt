To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably TA505, gains initial access to a system by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211). Following this, the attacker executes Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands. The question then asks if it's likely that the attacker would store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique of Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140). This technique involves the attacker decoding or deobfuscating files or information that was previously encoded or obfuscated to avoid detection. The use of Base64 encoding is a common method for obfuscating data, including malware loaders, to evade detection by security software.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: Given that the attacker has already used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to execute Cobalt Strike Beacon, it indicates a preference or at least a willingness to use encoding for evasion purposes. The tactic of Defense Evasion, which includes techniques like encoding data to avoid detection, aligns with storing malware components, such as the FlawedGrace RAT loader, in an encoded form. The technique T1140 directly supports the idea of using encoding (like Base64) to hide malicious files or information, which would later be deobfuscated or decoded for execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The attacker has used Base64 encoding for command execution, indicating a method for evasion.
    - The goal of defense evasion is to avoid detection, and encoding malware components like the FlawedGrace RAT loader would align with this goal.
    - The related TTPs support the use of encoding for evasion purposes.
    - Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker would store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings to continue evading defense mechanisms.

Final Answer: A
