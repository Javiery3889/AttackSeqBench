To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether Earth Lusca likely used specific tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) for network and system discovery before moving laterally within a compromised network by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing. The question essentially inquires about the plausibility of a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Earth Lusca.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the Discovery and Lateral Movement tactics. 
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** involves identifying systems on a network that can be used for further exploitation.
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery** is about discovering services running on remote systems, which can be potential targets for exploitation.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** involves exploiting vulnerabilities in services running on remote systems to gain access or control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The tools mentioned (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) are used for network scanning and discovery, which aligns with the Discovery tactics (T1018 and T1046). These tools can help in identifying potential targets and services running on the network.
   - The subsequent action of exploiting remote services (T1210) for lateral movement is a logical next step after discovering potential targets and services. This is because once vulnerabilities or exploitable services are identified, attackers can use them to move laterally within the network.
   - Internal spear phishing, while not directly related to the exploitation of remote services, can be a method used to further the lateral movement by tricking users into divulging credentials or executing malicious code, thereby gaining access to more systems or services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of the tools mentioned (network and system discovery).
   - **Step 2**: Relate these tools to the provided TTPs (T1018, T1046, and T1210), which are about discovery and lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack (discovery, followed by exploitation for lateral movement).
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment of the tools with the Discovery tactics and the logical progression to Lateral Movement via exploitation of remote services, it is plausible that Earth Lusca used such tools and techniques for these purposes.

Final Answer: A
