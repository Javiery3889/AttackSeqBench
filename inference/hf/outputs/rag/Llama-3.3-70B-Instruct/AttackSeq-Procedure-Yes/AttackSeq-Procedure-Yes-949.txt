To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware is used during the Collection phase to scan for files and stage data for exfiltration. It then asks if it's likely that the data will be sent to the primary Command and Control (C&C) server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server becomes operational.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control channel. This means that the attackers use the same channel they use to control the malware to also extract stolen data from the victim's network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using fallback or alternate communication channels in case the primary command and control channel is compromised or blocked. This could include using different ports, protocols, or even entirely different C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence where data exfiltration is happening over the primary C&C channel before potentially switching to a fallback channel. Given the techniques provided, exfiltrating data over the C2 channel (T1041) is a common practice, and using fallback channels (T1008) is a strategy to maintain communication if the primary channel is disrupted.
   - The use of commonly used ports for the primary C&C server is plausible because it might be part of the initial configuration to blend in with normal traffic, making it less suspicious. However, the question's context suggests a consideration of the operational sequence and the role of fallback channels in case the primary method is detected or blocked.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that the primary C&C server is likely used first for simplicity and to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that fallback channels are used as a contingency plan in case the primary channel is compromised.
   - **Step 3**: Consider that the sequence described (using the primary C&C server first) aligns with typical attacker behavior to use the most straightforward method first and have fallbacks for resilience.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is reasonable to assume that attackers would first attempt to use the primary C&C server over commonly used ports for data exfiltration before resorting to a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration.

Final Answer: A
