To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FIN13, presumably a threat actor group, uses specific tools and techniques. They utilize ProcDump to dump the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process memory, which is a technique often used to obtain credentials. Additionally, they execute passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution, indicating an interest in maintaining access and executing commands within the compromised environment. The question then asks if it's likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence**: This refers to the actions taken by an adversary to maintain their presence within a compromised environment. Deploying web shells can be part of persistence, as it allows for continued access.
   - **Technique: T1505.003 - Web Shell**: This is a specific technique under the persistence tactic, where an adversary deploys a web shell to maintain access. A web shell is a script that enables remote administration of a machine via the web.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**: This involves techniques used to obtain credentials. Dumping LSASS memory (T1003.001) is a method to gain access to credentials, fitting this tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - FIN13's actions (dumping LSASS process memory and executing backdoors) indicate a focus on both credential access and persistence within a network.
   - The use of web shells (T1505.003) is directly related to establishing and maintaining access, which aligns with the tactics of persistence and potentially initial access if the web shell is used as a beachhead.
   - Given that FIN13 is already engaged in activities that suggest a desire to maintain access and execute commands (persistence and credential access), it's reasonable to infer they might also exploit external servers and deploy web shells as part of their strategy to establish or maintain initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify FIN13's current tactics and techniques, which include credential access and persistence.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the related TTPs, which support the use of web shells for persistence and potentially initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the logical progression of an attack where initial access might be followed by establishing a persistent presence, and how web shells can serve both purposes.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the tactics already employed by FIN13, it is plausible that they would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks as part of their broader strategy.

Final Answer: A
