To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, using RevengeRAT, has established persistence on a victim's machine through a scheduled task. This task executes 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours. The question asks if it's likely that the malware will communicate with its command and control (C2) servers, sending victim machine information to specified domains, given that the attacker's infrastructure is located in Canada and Brazil.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates the attacker is using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the victim's system. The use of 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours fits this technique, as it ensures the malware can periodically perform its tasks without being detected.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This suggests that data exfiltration is a goal, potentially using scheduled transfers. Given the context, this could involve sending victim machine information to C2 servers at regular intervals.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This reinforces the use of scheduled tasks not just for persistence but also for executing malicious code, aligning with the initial persistence method described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where RevengeRAT has already established persistence, which aligns with the **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**.
   - The communication with C2 servers and the exfiltration of victim machine information to domains like 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net' can be associated with **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**, as it involves transferring data (in this case, victim information) to the attackers, potentially on a scheduled basis.
   - The locations of the attacker's infrastructure (Canada and Brazil) and the use of specific domains for C2 communication are details that support the plausibility of the scenario but do not directly relate to the TTPs listed. However, they add context to the potential for international involvement and the use of dynamic DNS services for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has established persistence using a scheduled task, which aligns with T1053.005.
   - **Step 2**: The goal of sending victim machine information to C2 servers matches the exfiltration tactic, particularly through scheduled transfers (T1029).
   - **Step 3**: The use of specific domains and the international location of the attacker's infrastructure supports the scenario's plausibility.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment with the described TTPs and the context provided, it is plausible that RevengeRAT would establish communication with its C2 servers and send victim machine information to the specified domains.

Final Answer: A
