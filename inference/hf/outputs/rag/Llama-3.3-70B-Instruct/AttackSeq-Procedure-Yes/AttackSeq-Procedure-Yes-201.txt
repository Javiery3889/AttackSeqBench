To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of actions attributed to FamousSparrow, a threat actor. The sequence starts with gaining initial access through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in specific software (Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera). Following this initial access, the question posits that FamousSparrow acquires infrastructure from several companies (Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY) for resource development. Finally, it mentions the use of cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application, which is a technique under the Initial Access tactic. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access to a network. The exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera, as mentioned in the question, aligns with this technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: 
    - The initial action described (exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access) matches the provided TTP (T1190).
    - Acquiring infrastructure for resource development is a common step after initial access, as it allows the threat actor to establish a foothold and prepare for further actions.
    - Using cmd.exe to download and install a backdoor (SparrowDoor) is a plausible next step, as backdoors are often used to maintain access to a compromised system.

Given these points, the sequence of actions described in the question (exploiting public-facing applications for initial access, acquiring infrastructure, and then using cmd.exe to install a backdoor) forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. This sequence aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors to gain and maintain access to targeted systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access method (exploiting public-facing applications) is a known and effective technique used by threat actors.
2. Acquiring infrastructure is a logical next step for resource development and further malicious activities.
3. Installing a backdoor (like SparrowDoor) via cmd.exe is a common method to ensure persistent access.

**Final Answer**: A
