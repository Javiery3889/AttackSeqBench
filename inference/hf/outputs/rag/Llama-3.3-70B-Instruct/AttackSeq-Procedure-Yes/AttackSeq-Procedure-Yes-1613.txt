To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group, a known cyber threat actor, uses backdoor malware for communication and command execution. It then inquires about the likelihood of them deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, which would disrupt a bank's operations. This scenario suggests a multi-stage attack with the goal of financial gain and operational disruption.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection. In the context of ransomware, deleting files such as Volume Shadow Copies can prevent system recovery, which aligns with the goal of ransomware attacks.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**: This technique is about inhibiting system recovery, which directly relates to the action of deleting backup files and Volume Shadow Copies. This would make it difficult or impossible for the targeted system to recover, amplifying the impact of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of backdoor malware for initial access and command execution sets the stage for further malicious activities.
   - Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete specific files like Volume Shadow Copies and backups directly aligns with the techniques of file deletion (for defense evasion) and inhibiting system recovery (to maximize impact).
   - The goal of disrupting the bank's operations during a heist suggests that the attackers aim to create chaos and ensure that their actions (likely financial transactions) cannot be easily undone or traced.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Lazarus group's use of backdoor malware indicates a sophisticated attack with potentially multiple stages.
   - **Step 2**: The deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete specific system recovery files aligns with known TTPs (T1070.004 and T1490) that aim to evade detection and maximize the attack's impact.
   - **Step 3**: The context of a bank heist suggests that operational disruption is a key goal, which is consistent with inhibiting system recovery and causing chaos.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, and the context of the attack, it is plausible that the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware for the described purposes.

Final Answer: A
