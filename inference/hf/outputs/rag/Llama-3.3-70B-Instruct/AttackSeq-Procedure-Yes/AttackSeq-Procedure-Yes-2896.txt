To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the 'yty' framework is using a football-themed strategy for Command and Control (C2) communication. This implies that the framework is already established within a target system and is communicating with its C2 server. The question then asks if it's likely that the framework will exfiltrate specific types of data (file listings, keystrokes, screenshots) back to the C2 server using plugins like 'abode.exe'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Exfiltration and Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This indicates that the context of the question involves the tactic of exfiltrating data from a compromised system and the specific technique of using the existing C2 channel for this exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - The question mentions that the 'yty' framework is already communicating with its C2 server, which aligns with the initial steps necessary for exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041).
    - The types of data mentioned (file listings, keystrokes, screenshots) are common targets for exfiltration in cyber attacks, as they can provide valuable information to the attackers.
    - The use of plugins like 'abode.exe' suggests a modular approach to the framework's functionality, which is consistent with many modern malware frameworks that can load additional modules for specific tasks, such as data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - **Step 1**: The 'yty' framework is communicating with its C2 server, which is a prerequisite for exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.
    - **Step 2**: The data types mentioned are typical for exfiltration, aligning with the Exfiltration tactic and the T1041 technique.
    - **Step 3**: The modular design suggested by the use of plugins like 'abode.exe' supports the capability to perform specific tasks such as data exfiltration.
    - **Conclusion**: Given the established C2 communication, the types of data targeted for exfiltration, and the modular design of the framework, it is plausible that the 'yty' framework would exfiltrate data back to the C2 server using plugins like 'abode.exe'.

Final Answer: A
