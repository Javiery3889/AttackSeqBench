To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that an adversary, referred to as TG1021, performed reconnaissance using specific tools (SharpHound and PowerSploit) before exploiting a vulnerability in internet-facing Windows IIS servers. This involves understanding the context of the attack, which includes the use of deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability for initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by adversaries. The related TTPs are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This involves discovering remote systems, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is about exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access, which aligns with the exploitation of internet-facing Windows IIS servers mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include using tools to discover system details, potentially aligning with the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for gathering target information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the attack and the related TTPs, the question essentially asks if the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance (discovery) is plausible before exploiting a public-facing application. SharpHound is a tool used for gathering information about Active Directory environments, and PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell modules for various post-exploitation activities, including reconnaissance. Loading these tools directly into memory could be a tactic to avoid detection while gathering information on targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary's goal is to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers, which requires some level of reconnaissance to identify vulnerable targets.
   - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for system and remote system discovery aligns with the Discovery tactics (T1018 and T1082) mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - Loading these tools into memory could be a stealthy way to perform this reconnaissance without being detected, fitting into the context of preparing for an exploit by gathering necessary information about the target systems.
   - The exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190) is the initial access tactic, which would logically follow the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A**
