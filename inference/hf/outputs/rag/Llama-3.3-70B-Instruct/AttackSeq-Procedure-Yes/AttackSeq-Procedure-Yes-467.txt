To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document to exploit CVE-2018-4878, aiming to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations. It then asks if it's likely that Hidden Cobra would develop Bankshot implants to gain full control over victim systems and wipe files, under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the use of exploitation techniques to execute malicious code on a client system, which aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 for initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves using spear phishing with a link to gain initial access. While the question specifies an attachment, the principle of using spear phishing aligns.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This directly matches the method described in the question, where a malicious attachment (a Word document) is used for spear phishing to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access method described (spear phishing with a malicious attachment) matches one of the provided TTPs (T1566.001), indicating that Hidden Cobra is capable of and has used such tactics for initial access.
   - The exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) for client execution (T1203) is a plausible next step after gaining initial access, as it would allow for the execution of malicious code on the victim's system.
   - Developing implants like Bankshot for gaining full control and wiping files from targeted systems would be a logical progression after initial access and execution, as it would enable further control and potential data destruction or exfiltration. This aligns with the concept of Resource Development, where an attacker develops and refines their capabilities on a compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing with a malicious attachment to gain initial access, which is a known TTP (T1566.001).
   - **Step 2**: The exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 for client execution (T1203) is a plausible action following initial access, allowing for the execution of malicious code.
   - **Step 3**: Developing capabilities like Bankshot for full control and file wiping under the tactic of Resource Development is a logical next step after establishing a foothold and executing code on the victim system.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the initial access method, the exploitation technique, and the logical progression of developing capabilities for further control and potential data destruction, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would develop such implants.

Final Answer: A
