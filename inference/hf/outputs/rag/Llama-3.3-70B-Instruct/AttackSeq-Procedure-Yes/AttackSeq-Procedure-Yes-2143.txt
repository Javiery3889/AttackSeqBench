To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions taken by malware. First, it achieves persistence through creating a RunOnce key in the registry. This action is associated with ensuring the malware runs upon system startup or user login, aligning with the tactic of persistence. Following this, the question asks if it's likely the malware will then perform discovery (obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process) before establishing command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are focused on persistence and privilege escalation, specifically through the use of registry run keys/startup folders (T1547.001). This technique is used for maintaining access to a system by executing malicious programs at startup or when a user logs in.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Persistence**: The initial action of creating a RunOnce key in the registry for persistence is directly supported by the related TTPs (T1547.001).
    - **Discovery**: Obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process are actions that could be part of the discovery phase, allowing the malware to understand its environment and potentially prepare for further exploitation or evasion. However, the provided TTPs do not directly address discovery techniques.
    - **Establishing Command and Control through Process Hollowing**: This is a technique used for evasion and execution, where a legitimate process is hollowed out and replaced with malicious code. While not directly mentioned in the provided TTPs, it's a plausible next step for malware seeking to communicate with its C2 server without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The malware achieves persistence, which is a common initial step to ensure continued access to a compromised system.
    - Discovery actions (like obtaining user names and identifying processes) can logically follow as the malware seeks to understand its operating environment and plan its next moves, which could include privilege escalation or lateral movement.
    - Establishing a covert channel for C2 communication through Process Hollowing is a sophisticated step that aligns with the goals of maintaining access and executing further malicious activities without detection.

Given the logical progression from achieving persistence, through discovery, to establishing command and control for further malicious activities, and considering the tactics and techniques involved, the sequence described in the question seems plausible for the lifecycle of a sophisticated malware campaign.

**Final Answer: A**
