To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the Dragonfly group, starting with using self-deleting code for defense evasion, then gathering system information as part of the discovery tactic, and finally using the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement. The question asks if it's likely that this sequence focused on Windows systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This indicates the use of techniques to remove indicators of compromise, which aligns with the use of self-deleting code to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This shows the use of remote desktop protocol for moving laterally within a network, which is a common technique for spreading within an infected network or between networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of self-deleting code for defense evasion (T1070) suggests an attempt to remain stealthy, which is consistent with advanced threat actors like the Dragonfly group.
   - The focus on gathering system information is a common step after initial compromise, as it helps in understanding the network layout and potential targets.
   - The use of the remote-desktop protocol (T1021.001) for lateral movement is plausible, especially in environments where remote access is common, such as Windows systems in enterprise networks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Dragonfly group's use of self-deleting code for defense evasion indicates a sophisticated approach to remaining undetected.
   - **Step 2**: Gathering system information is a logical next step after evading defenses, as it would help in planning further actions, such as lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: The use of the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement is consistent with targeting Windows systems, given the prevalence of remote desktop services in Windows environments.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that the Dragonfly group focused on Windows systems to gather system information before using the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement. This sequence of actions aligns with the described TTPs and the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors.

Final Answer: A
