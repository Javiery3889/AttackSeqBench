To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, FIN13, has already gained initial access to a system by exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware. It then asks if it's likely that they would use a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server for command execution, before establishing persistence using other tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Persistence** with **Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This indicates the use of web shells to maintain access to a compromised system. Web shells can be used for various purposes, including executing commands, uploading files, and maintaining a foothold in the system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control** with **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This involves using multiple stages or layers of communication to control compromised systems. This can include setting up intermediate command and control (C2) servers or using existing infrastructure to relay commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server for listening to incoming HTTP requests aligns with the concept of maintaining command and control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels). This backdoor could serve as a mechanism for receiving commands from the attackers.
   - The subsequent use of tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for establishing persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell) suggests a multi-faceted approach to maintaining access to the compromised system. Web shells are a common method for persistence, allowing attackers to execute commands and maintain their foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access**: FIN13 gains access through exploiting external servers.
   - **Command and Control**: Using a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE for command execution fits within the tactic of establishing multi-stage channels for command and control. This allows for stealthy and potentially more reliable communication.
   - **Persistence**: The use of web shells (like those enabled by BLUEAGAVE) and other tools (SIXPACK, trojanized KeePass binaries) for persistence is a logical next step after establishing command and control. It ensures that even if one method of access is discovered and blocked, others remain available.

Given the information and the logical progression from initial access to command and control and then to persistence, it seems plausible that FIN13 would employ such a strategy to maximize their control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
