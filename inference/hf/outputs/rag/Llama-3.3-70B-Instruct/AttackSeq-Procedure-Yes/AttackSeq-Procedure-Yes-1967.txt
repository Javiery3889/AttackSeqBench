To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, after conducting discovery activities using tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather Active Directory information, is likely to use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally through the environment. The goal is to access data from Information Repositories.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This indicates the threat actor is interested in understanding the domain structure and trust relationships within the Active Directory. This is a common step for planning further actions, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This shows the threat actor uses RDP to move laterally within the network. RDP is a legitimate tool that can be used for remote administration, but in the context of a threat actor, it's used to gain access to other systems on the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery suggests the threat actor is highly capable and interested in detailed network and system information.
   - The discovery activities, including domain trust discovery, would provide the necessary information for planning lateral movement.
   - Using RDP for lateral movement is a common tactic, especially if the threat actor has obtained credentials for both privileged and non-privileged accounts. This allows them to blend in with normal network activity while moving through the environment.
   - Accessing data from Information Repositories would be a logical next step after gaining access to the desired systems through lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The threat actor conducts discovery to understand the network layout and identify potential targets.
   - **Step 2**: With the information gathered, the threat actor uses RDP to move laterally, potentially using both privileged and non-privileged accounts to avoid detection and ensure access to various parts of the network.
   - **Step 3**: The goal of lateral movement in this context is to access sensitive data, which aligns with the interest in Information Repositories.
   - Given the tactics and techniques described, it is logical that the threat actor would use both types of accounts for RDP to maximize their ability to move undetected and access the desired data.

Final Answer: A
