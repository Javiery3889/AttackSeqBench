To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where PyFlash, presumably a piece of malware, executes commands to gather system information (like systeminfo and ipconfig) and then asks if it's likely that PyFlash will communicate with its command and control (C&C) server using AES-128 encryption in CBC mode to send the exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This suggests the use of standard encoding schemes for communication between the malware and its C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This indicates the gathering of system information, which aligns with the execution of commands like systeminfo and ipconfig.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This implies the use of symmetric cryptography (like AES) for encrypting data communicated between the malware and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions PyFlash gathering system information, which aligns with **T1082-System Information Discovery**.
   - The use of AES-128 encryption in CBC mode for communicating with the C&C server aligns with **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**, as AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
   - The communication with a C&C server using encryption also fits within the **Command and Control** tactic, specifically using encryption as a form of **T1132.001-Standard Encoding** for secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: PyFlash gathers system information using commands like systeminfo and ipconfig, which matches the **Discovery** tactic and specifically **T1082-System Information Discovery**.
   - **Step 2**: The use of AES-128 encryption in CBC mode for communication with the C&C server is a method of secure communication that fits within the **Command and Control** tactic, specifically utilizing **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** for encryption.
   - **Step 3**: Given that the related TTPs support both the gathering of system information and the use of symmetric cryptography for C&C communication, it is reasonable to conclude that PyFlash would communicate with its C&C server using AES-128 encryption in CBC mode after gathering system information.
   
**Final Answer: A**
