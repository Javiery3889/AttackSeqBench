To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically the FIN8 group, has conducted system fingerprinting and discovered a Domain Controller. They used commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` during the Discovery phase. The question then asks if it's likely that this group will achieve lateral movement to the Domain Controller using `wmic.exe` to execute a deployment script, with indications of using `wmiexec.py` from Impacket for this purpose.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This TTP is about discovering the domain trust relationships within an Active Directory environment. Tools like `nltest.exe` can be used for this purpose, which aligns with the initial steps described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**: This TTP involves using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute commands or scripts on a remote system. `wmic.exe` is a command-line tool that interacts with WMI, and `wmiexec.py` from Impacket is a Python script that allows for remote execution via WMI, which fits the description of achieving lateral movement and executing scripts on the Domain Controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial steps of system fingerprinting and discovering the Domain Controller using `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` are consistent with the Discovery phase and the T1482 technique.
   - The use of `wmic.exe` for executing a deployment script, potentially with the aid of `wmiexec.py` from Impacket, aligns with the Execution tactic and the T1047 technique. This method is plausible for achieving lateral movement to the Domain Controller, as it leverages WMI for remote execution, a known and effective technique used by various threat actors, including FIN8.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The FIN8 group has successfully conducted the initial reconnaissance and discovery, identifying the Domain Controller.
   - **Step 2**: The use of `wmic.exe` and potentially `wmiexec.py` for lateral movement and script execution on the Domain Controller is a feasible next step, given the TTPs associated with FIN8 and the described techniques.
   - **Step 3**: The combination of these steps aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by sophisticated threat actors for lateral movement and remote execution within a network.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the alignment with the described TTPs, it is plausible that FIN8 could achieve lateral movement to the Domain Controller using the described methods.

Final Answer: A
