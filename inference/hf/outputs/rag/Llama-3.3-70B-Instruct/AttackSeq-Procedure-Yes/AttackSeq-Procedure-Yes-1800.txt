To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed the use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) command and control (C2) servers. This observation is linked to a campaign that allegedly launched Distributed Denial of Service attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, resulting in a significant impact on Next Media's network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File**: This TTP indicates that attackers are using encryption or encoding to evade detection. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files falls under this category, as it's a method to hide or obscure the content of these files from security tools and analysts.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service**: This TTP is about causing a denial of service condition on an endpoint, which aligns with the goal of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack. The impact mentioned, such as Next Media's network suffering a 'total failure', can be a result of such an attack.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of encoded configuration files (T1027.013) suggests that the attackers are taking steps to evade detection, which is consistent with the tactics used in sophisticated cyber attacks, including those that involve DDOS.
   - The impact described (a 'total failure' of Next Media's network) aligns with the expected outcome of a successful DDOS attack, which is to overwhelm the targeted system and make it unavailable (T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers' use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files indicates a level of sophistication and intent to evade detection.
   - **Step 2**: The encoded files are associated with DDOS C2 servers, which directly links to the capability of launching Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
   - **Step 3**: The described impact on Next Media's network and the targeting of websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong suggest a motivated attack with specific goals, consistent with the use of DDOS as a means to disrupt or silence targeted entities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the evidence of encoded configuration files used by DDOS C2 servers and the alignment of the attack's impact with the goals of a DDOS campaign, it is plausible that the attackers launched these attacks.

Final Answer: A
