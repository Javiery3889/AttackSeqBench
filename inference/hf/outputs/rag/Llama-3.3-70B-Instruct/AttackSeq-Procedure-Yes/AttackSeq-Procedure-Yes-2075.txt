To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising, which involves redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites, and then runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter. This sequence involves several steps: initial access through malvertising or drive-by compromise, followed by execution of a PowerShell script.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This indicates the use of malicious advertisements to deliver malware. Malvertising can lead to drive-by downloads or redirects to malicious sites without the user's interaction.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used to download and execute malware, making it a common choice for attackers.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by exploiting vulnerabilities when they visit a malicious website or a website that has been compromised by an attacker. This can lead to the execution of malicious code on the user's system without their knowledge.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a sequence that starts with malvertising (or drive-by compromise) as the initial access vector, which aligns with **T1583.008-Malvertising** and **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**. These techniques can be used to redirect users to malicious sites or directly compromise their systems.
   - The next step in the sequence involves running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware, which aligns with **T1059.001-PowerShell**. This technique is commonly used for executing scripts that can download additional malware or tools, further compromising the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access vector described (malvertising or drive-by compromise) matches the techniques **T1583.008-Malvertising** and **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**, indicating that the attacker gains initial access through these means.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, the use of an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware aligns with **T1059.001-PowerShell**, showing how the attacker executes malicious code on the compromised system.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment of the described sequence with the provided TTPs, it is plausible that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising and then uses PowerShell to fetch and execute malware.

Final Answer: A
