To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe) evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques. It then asks if it's likely that Aumlib will download its updated sample from specific URLs and share code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the attackers are using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control (C2) communications. This technique involves using standard web protocols to communicate with compromised systems, which can include downloading updates or receiving commands.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves modifying tools or malware to remove indicators that might be used to detect them, such as altering communication patterns to evade signature-based detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the malware evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic, specifically using encoding techniques to avoid detection.
   - The action of downloading updated samples from specific URLs directly relates to the **Command and Control** tactic, using web protocols for communication. Sharing code with an older variant could be part of maintaining or updating the malware, which also fits within the context of command and control activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware's ability to evade detection through altered HTTP communication patterns suggests it is designed to operate stealthily and maintain communication with its command and control servers.
   - The use of web protocols for command and control, as indicated by T1071.001, supports the likelihood that the malware would download updates or communicate through specific URLs.
   - The sharing of code with an older variant could be a strategy to maintain compatibility, update capabilities, or ensure continued evasion techniques are effective, all of which are plausible within the context of command and control activities.

**Final Answer: A**
