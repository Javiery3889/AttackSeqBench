To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation. Following this, it queries whether it's likely that the shellcode would then contact its Command and Control (C&C) server at a specified URL (`https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`) and resolve a specific domain (`psychology-blog.ezua[.]com`) to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91` for further malicious activities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a process by loading a malicious DLL. The use of `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` in the question aligns with this technique, as it's a method to escalate privileges within a system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This is a broader category that includes injecting code into a process. The specific use of a DLL injection falls under this category but is more specifically described by T1055.001.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a resolver to dynamically determine the IP address associated with a domain name or other identifier. This can be used to locate a C&C server without directly specifying its IP address, adding a layer of obfuscation and flexibility to the communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial action described (using `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation) aligns with the provided TTPs related to privilege escalation.
   - The subsequent action of contacting a C&C server and resolving a domain to a specific IP for further malicious activity aligns with the TTP related to Command and Control, specifically using a technique like a dead drop resolver to dynamically resolve domains or identifiers to locate the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker escalates privileges using a Metasploit module, which is a common initial step in establishing a foothold within a system.
   - **Step 2**: After establishing a foothold and escalating privileges, the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish communication with a C&C server to receive further instructions or upload stolen data.
   - **Step 3**: The use of a domain (`psychology-blog.ezua[.]com`) that resolves to a specific IP address (`209.239.115[.]91`), which is also the location of the C&C server, fits the pattern of using dead drop resolvers or similar techniques for C&C communication. This method allows the attackers to change the IP address of the C&C server by simply updating the DNS record, making it harder to track and block their activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is plausible that after privilege escalation, the shellcode would contact its C&C server and use domain resolution for further malicious activity, as this aligns with common post-exploitation tactics used by attackers.

Final Answer: A
