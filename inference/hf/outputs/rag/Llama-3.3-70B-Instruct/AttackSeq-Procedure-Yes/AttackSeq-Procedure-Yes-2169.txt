To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails after using a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance. This implies a multi-step process involving reconnaissance and then initial access through phishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are all under the "Initial Access" tactic, which is about how attackers gain an initial foothold into a network. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1566: Phishing** - The general technique of using phishing to gain access.
   - **T1566.002: Spearphishing Link** - A specific type of phishing that involves sending links to specific targets.
   - **T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment** - Another specific type of phishing that involves sending malicious attachments to specific targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: The question describes a scenario where attackers first use a reconnaissance technique (involving Microsoft Word sending a GET request) and then use spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links to gain initial access. This scenario involves a form of spear phishing, which aligns with T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) since it involves links, and potentially T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) if the OLE2 documents are considered attachments. However, the primary method of delivery described (emails with embedded links) aligns more closely with T1566.002.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers are using a reconnaissance technique to gather information about the target's software.
   - They then use this information to craft targeted spear phishing emails.
   - The emails contain OLE2 format documents with embedded links, which the targets are tricked into clicking, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or the installation of malware.
   - This process is a form of spear phishing, specifically using links (T1566.002), which is a known technique for gaining initial access.

Given the information and the related TTPs, the scenario described fits within the realm of plausible attack sequences, especially considering the use of targeted phishing emails with embedded links as a common initial access vector.

**Final Answer: A**
