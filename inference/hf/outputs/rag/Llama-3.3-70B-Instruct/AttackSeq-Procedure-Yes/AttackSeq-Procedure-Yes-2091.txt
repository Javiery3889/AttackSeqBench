To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained access to an organization's internal network, have used a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network, and have collected administrative-level credentials. The question asks if it's likely that the attackers will then move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising workstations, and targeting internal hosts and servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This indicates the attackers have gained access to domain accounts, which are typically used for administrative purposes across a network. Having these credentials allows for significant control and movement within the network.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This suggests the use of tools to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the capability to compromise additional systems after initial access has been gained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already achieved initial access and have administrative-level credentials (as indicated by T1078.002), it is highly plausible they would use these credentials and tools like Cobalt Strike to facilitate lateral movement.
   - The technique T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) directly supports the idea of moving laterally across the network, which would involve compromising workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have gained initial access and have the means (administrative credentials and tools like Cobalt Strike) to navigate and map the network.
   - **Step 2**: With administrative-level credentials, they can likely bypass many security controls designed to limit lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: The presence of T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) as a related TTP indicates that lateral movement is a likely next step, as it involves transferring tools to other systems to expand control.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the attackers' current position within the network and the tools and credentials at their disposal, it is highly likely they will move laterally to compromise more systems and achieve their objectives.

Final Answer: A
