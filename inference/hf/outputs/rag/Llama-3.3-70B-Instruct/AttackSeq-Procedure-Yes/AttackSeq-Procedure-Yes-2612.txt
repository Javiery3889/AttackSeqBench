To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have used mobile applications with spyware to collect sensitive information from victims. It then asks if it's likely that the stolen data will be sent to the attackers' infrastructure over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This indicates that attackers can use application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This suggests that data exfiltration can be automated, potentially using various protocols or methods.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This implies that command and control can also be achieved using protocols other than those at the application layer, such as using DNS tunneling or other lower-layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the Command and Control phase and the use of an application layer protocol for receiving stolen data. 
   - Given that T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is listed under the Command and Control tactic, it directly supports the idea that application layer protocols can be used for this purpose.
   - While T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol) offers an alternative method for command and control, the question's context and the specific mention of application layer protocols align more closely with T1071.
   - T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) suggests that exfiltration can be automated but does not specify the protocol layer used, making it less directly relevant to the question about the protocol layer.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question is about the likelihood of using an application layer protocol for command and control to receive stolen data.
   - The related TTPs include a technique specifically about using application layer protocols for command and control (T1071).
   - This technique directly supports the scenario described in the question.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

Final Answer: A
