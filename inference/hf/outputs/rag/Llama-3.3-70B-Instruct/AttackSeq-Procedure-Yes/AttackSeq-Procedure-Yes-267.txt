To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have managed to inject a NanoCore RAT payload into a new process without the payload touching the disk, which is a technique used for defense evasion. It then asks if it's likely for the attackers to connect the RAT back to its control server, specifically associated with the domain chickenkiller.com, which is owned by a free dynamic DNS service, during command and control.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This indicates the attackers are using process injection to potentially escalate privileges, which aligns with the scenario of injecting the NanoCore RAT into a new process.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This suggests the use of DNS for command and control, which could involve using domains (like the one mentioned) for communication between the RAT and its control server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This reinforces the use of process injection as a method to evade defenses, aligning with the initial step of keeping the RAT payload in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of process injection (T1055) for defense evasion and potentially for privilege escalation indicates sophisticated tactics by the attackers.
   - The mention of connecting back to a control server via a domain associated with a free dynamic DNS service during command and control (T1071.004-DNS) is a common method for attackers to maintain command and control over compromised systems while making it harder to track the command and control server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have successfully injected the NanoCore RAT into a new process, indicating they have the capability to execute code on the target system.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a free dynamic DNS service for the domain chickenkiller.com suggests an attempt to make the command and control infrastructure more resilient and harder to track.
   - **Step 3**: Given the tactics and techniques used (process injection for defense evasion and potential privilege escalation, and the use of DNS for command and control), it is plausible that the attackers would connect the RAT back to its control server for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the tactics and techniques provided, it is likely that the attackers would connect the RAT back to its control server during command and control, as this aligns with common attack patterns and the described TTPs.

Final Answer: A
