To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a Helminth Trojan agent uses a customized version of Mimikatz to gather information. After this initial step, it queries whether the DnE1.Ps1 file will use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server and download a bat script for execution. This involves understanding the capabilities of the Helminth Trojan, the use of Mimikatz for information gathering, and the potential for DNS queries in command and control communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This indicates the use of DNS for communication with a C&C server, which is a common method for covert communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz for information gathering.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This refers to the automated gathering of data, which could be related to the initial information gathering phase using Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of Mimikatz for information gathering (related to T1082) suggests an initial phase of discovery.
   - The question then shifts to the potential use of DNS queries (T1071.004) for C&C communication, which is a plausible next step after initial information gathering, especially if the malware intends to download additional payloads (like a bat script) from a C&C server.
   - The automated collection (T1119) could be part of the ongoing process of gathering more information or could be related to the execution of the downloaded script.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Helminth Trojan uses Mimikatz for initial information gathering, aligning with system information discovery (T1082).
   - **Step 2**: After gathering initial information, the next logical step for the malware could be to communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions or download additional tools, which could involve using DNS queries (T1071.004) for stealthy communication.
   - **Step 3**: The use of DNS to download a bat script for execution fits within the context of command and control tactics, where the malware is being controlled remotely to perform specific actions.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after the initial information gathering, the DnE1.Ps1 file would use DNS exchange queries to communicate with a C&C server and download a bat script for execution.

Final Answer: A
