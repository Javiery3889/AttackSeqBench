To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the provided Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of events.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) in Microsoft Office to gain initial access. This is followed by the potential deployment of a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER. The backdoor allegedly establishes persistence by writing itself to a specific location (`%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1`) and using a run key in the registry.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 for initial access fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.002-Office Test**: This technique involves using Office applications (like Microsoft Word) to maintain persistence. Writing a malicious script to a location like `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` could be a method to achieve persistence through Office applications.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This involves using registry run keys or startup folders to maintain persistence. The use of a run key in the registry to ensure the backdoor starts upon system or user login aligns with this technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 aligns with T1203, which is about exploiting client applications for execution.
   - The deployment of a PowerShell backdoor (POWERSHOWER) and its method of establishing persistence by writing to a specific Word-related directory (`%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1`) and using a registry run key matches the persistence techniques outlined in T1137.002 (using Office for persistence) and T1547.001 (using registry run keys for persistence).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers exploit a client-side vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access, which aligns with T1203.
   - **Step 2**: The attackers deploy a PowerShell backdoor, which is a common tool for post-exploitation activities.
   - **Step 3**: The backdoor establishes persistence through two methods: writing itself to a Word-related directory and using a registry run key, aligning with T1137.002 and T1547.001, respectively.
   - Given the alignment of the attack sequence with the described TTPs and the logical progression from initial access to establishing persistence, it is plausible that the attackers would deploy the backdoor before establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
