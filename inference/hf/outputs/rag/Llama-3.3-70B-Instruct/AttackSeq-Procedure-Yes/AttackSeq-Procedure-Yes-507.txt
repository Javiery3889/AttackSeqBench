To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SombRAT backdoor has already performed process discovery and system information discovery. It then asks if it's likely that SombRAT will use proxy tools (like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY) for protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the destination of the command and control traffic, making it harder to detect and block.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves tunneling C2 communications over a protocol that is typically allowed through a network's defenses, such as DNS or HTTP, to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of proxy tools (as mentioned in the question) aligns with **T1090-Proxy**, as these tools can act as intermediaries to hide the true destination of the C2 traffic.
   - The mention of implementing protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP directly relates to **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**, as it involves using these protocols to tunnel C2 communications, potentially evading network defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The SombRAT backdoor has completed initial discovery phases, indicating it has the necessary information about the system and its processes.
   - **Step 2**: The use of proxy tools and protocol tunneling techniques is a common method for malware to communicate with C2 servers without being detected.
   - **Step 3**: The specific mention of proxy tools and protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP matches the related TTPs provided (T1090-Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling), indicating that such actions are within the capabilities and intentions of the SombRAT backdoor.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after performing initial discovery, SombRAT would use proxy tools for protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
