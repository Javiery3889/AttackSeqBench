To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has compromised SolarWinds, using it as a vector to deliver the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack. This backdoor is used for initial access. The question then asks if it's likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol for further exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the attacker uses web protocols (like HTTP or HTTPS) for communication between the compromised system and the C2 server. This technique is commonly used because it blends in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This refers to the method used to gain initial access to a network by compromising the software supply chain, which is exactly what happened with the SolarWinds compromise and the delivery of the Sunburst backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack for initial access, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve establishing communication with a C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data. 
   - The use of web protocols (T1071.001) for C2 communication is a common tactic because it allows the attackers to hide their malicious traffic within the volume of normal web traffic, reducing the likelihood of detection.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that after gaining initial access, the attackers would use a protocol (like HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate with their C2 server for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained initial access through a supply-chain attack.
   - The next step in a typical attack sequence involves establishing C2 for further exploitation.
   - Using web protocols for C2 communication is a known and effective technique for hiding malicious activity.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A
