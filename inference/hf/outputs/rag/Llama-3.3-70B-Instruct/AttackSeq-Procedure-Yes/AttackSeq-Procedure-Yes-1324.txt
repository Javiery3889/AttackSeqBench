To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions attributed to CosmicDuke, a type of malware. These actions include searching removable drives, skipping certain file types during collection, and then potentially using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information. Finally, it mentions exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the actions described in the question. 
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** suggests the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** indicates the use of keylogging to collect data, which aligns with the use of a keylogger mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System** implies collecting data from the local system, which could include searching removable drives and collecting specific types of data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question mentions specific methods of data collection (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) and exfiltration (via FTP), which are common techniques used by malware like CosmicDuke for gathering and sending sensitive information back to the attackers.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that CosmicDuke could engage in these activities. T1056.001-Keylogging directly aligns with the use of a keylogger. While T1005-Data from Local System is broader, it encompasses the concept of collecting data from the local system, including from removable drives.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration suggests that the malware could use automated means to exfiltrate data, which could include using FTP as a method for sending the collected data to remote servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key actions described in the question (data collection methods and exfiltration via FTP).
   - **Step 2**: Match these actions with the provided TTPs to see if there's a correlation.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities and behaviors of CosmicDuke malware.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment between the described actions and the related TTPs, along with the typical behaviors of CosmicDuke, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use such methods for data collection and exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
