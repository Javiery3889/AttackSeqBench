To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained initial access by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet. It then asks if it's likely that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs before deploying malicious containers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This indicates the initial method of gaining access, which in this case, involves exploiting external remote services, such as misconfigured Docker API ports.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1610-Deploy Container**: This suggests that after gaining access, one of the actions taken could be deploying containers, potentially for malicious purposes.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.007-Container API**: This implies that adversaries might use container APIs to gain access to credentials or further exploit the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context, the question essentially asks if detecting compromised Docker APIs (potentially using tools like DOCKERGEDDON) during reconnaissance is a likely step before deploying malicious containers. 

- **DOCKERGEDDON** is a tool that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in Docker APIs. If Docker APIs are exposed and misconfigured, an attacker might use such tools to identify vulnerable APIs.
- The **Initial Access** tactic via **T1133-External Remote Services** already implies that the Docker API is exposed and potentially vulnerable.
- The subsequent actions, such as **Deploy Container (T1610)** and using **Container API (T1552.007)** for credential access, suggest that after initial access, attackers might indeed be interested in further exploiting the Docker environment.

However, the question is about the likelihood of using tools like DOCKERGEDDON **during reconnaissance** before deploying malicious containers. Reconnaissance in the context of CTI usually refers to the phase where attackers gather information about the target environment to plan their attack. If the Docker API is already exploited for initial access, the use of DOCKERGEDDON or similar tools might be more about exploitation rather than reconnaissance.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access** is gained via exposed Docker API ports.
2. The question implies a sequence where after initial access, attackers might use tools to detect or further exploit the Docker environment.
3. **DOCKERGEDDON** could be used to exploit Docker APIs, but this action seems more aligned with exploitation rather than reconnaissance.
4. Given the TTPs, the focus is on exploiting the Docker environment after initial access, which includes deploying malicious containers and potentially using container APIs for credential access.

Considering these points, the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON seems plausible as part of the exploitation process, which might not strictly be categorized under reconnaissance but rather as part of the post-exploitation or execution tactics. However, the question's framing around "during reconnaissance" might slightly misalign with the typical use of such tools in the attack sequence.

Given the context and focusing strictly on the question's wording about "during reconnaissance," the answer might lean towards acknowledging the plausibility of using such tools for detecting vulnerabilities in the Docker environment as part of the attack process, even if the terminology doesn't perfectly align with traditional reconnaissance activities.

**Final Answer: A**
