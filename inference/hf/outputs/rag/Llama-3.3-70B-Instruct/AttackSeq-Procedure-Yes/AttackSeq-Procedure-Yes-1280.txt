To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with Tropic Trooper exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities. This is a method of gaining initial access to a system, which aligns with the Execution tactic, specifically the technique of exploiting vulnerabilities for client execution (T1203).

2. **Execution of Malicious Documents**: After gaining initial access, the attackers download and install an MSI package. This step involves executing malicious code on the victim's system, which could include the execution of malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper. This is part of the Execution tactic.

3. **Establishing Persistence**: The backdoor then establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control (C2) servers via SSL. This step is about maintaining access to the system, which aligns with the Persistence tactic. The techniques mentioned under Persistence include DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) and Add-ins (T1137.006), which are methods used to maintain a foothold in the system.

Given these steps, the question asks whether it's likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

- **Analyzing the Sequence**: The execution of malicious documents is a step that would logically occur after initial access is gained (through exploiting vulnerabilities) and before the backdoor establishes persistence. This is because the malicious documents are likely the vehicle for delivering the backdoor to the system.

- **Related TTPs Analysis**: The techniques provided under Execution and Persistence support this sequence. Exploitation for client execution (T1203) would lead to the execution of malicious code, which could include the dropper. The persistence techniques (T1574.002 and T1137.006) suggest methods the backdoor might use to maintain its presence, which would follow the initial execution of the malicious documents.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs, it is logical that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper would be executed after initial access is gained and before the backdoor establishes persistence. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where initial access leads to the execution of malicious code, which then leads to establishing a persistent presence on the system.
