To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Initial Access through Phishing Emails**: The attack starts with phishing emails that contain a malicious Word document. This is a common initial access vector where attackers use social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious attachments.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Script via VBS Macro**: The malicious Word document contains a VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) macro that retrieves an encoded PowerShell script. This indicates the use of malicious files (T1204.002) to execute code on the victim's system. The fact that the PowerShell script is encoded suggests an attempt to evade detection by security software.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The execution of the PowerShell script falls under the Execution tactic, specifically using PowerShell (T1059.001). PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including downloading and executing additional payloads.

4. **Downloading Payloads Associated with Ursnif and GandCrab Malware**: The question mentions the download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Ursnif is known for its banking trojan capabilities, and GandCrab is a ransomware. Both are types of malware that could be downloaded and executed as part of a cyber attack to compromise a system further.

Given the related TTPs:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File** indicates the use of malicious files to gain execution, which aligns with the use of a malicious Word document and a VBS macro to retrieve and execute an encoded PowerShell script.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell** directly relates to the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is a key part of the described attack sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access vector (phishing emails with malicious attachments) is a common method used by attackers.
2. The use of a VBS macro to retrieve an encoded PowerShell script is a known technique for executing malicious code without being detected easily.
3. The execution of PowerShell scripts (T1059.001) can be used to download additional malware payloads.
4. The download of Ursnif and GandCrab malware payloads aligns with the goal of compromising the system for financial gain or ransom.

**Conclusion**: Given the provided TTPs and the description of the attack sequence, it is plausible that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Final Answer: A**
