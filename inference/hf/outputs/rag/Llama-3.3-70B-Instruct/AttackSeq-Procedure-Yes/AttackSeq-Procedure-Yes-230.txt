To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a loader DLL is used to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory. This action is associated with defense evasion tactics, aiming to avoid detection by security systems. The question then asks if, after this step, the Lazarus group would likely have the backdoors connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands and conduct further activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the command and control channel, making it harder to detect. This is relevant because, after establishing a backdoor, connecting to a C2 server would be a logical next step for an attacker to issue commands.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute DLLs, which can be used to load malicious code into memory without directly executing an executable file. This is relevant to the initial action described in the question, where a loader DLL is used for defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information to avoid detection. The use of an encrypted backdoor that gets decrypted in memory aligns with this technique, as it's a method to hide the true nature of the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines an initial step of defense evasion through the use of a loader DLL to execute an encrypted backdoor in memory. This aligns with techniques aimed at avoiding detection.
   - The related TTPs provide context that after such evasion techniques are used, the next logical step for an attacker like the Lazarus group would be to establish communication with C2 servers. This is essential for receiving further commands and conducting malicious activities.
   - The technique T1104-Multi-Stage Channels directly supports the idea of connecting to C2 servers in a way that is designed to be difficult to detect, which aligns with the initial defense evasion tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action described involves defense evasion through executing an encrypted backdoor in memory.
   - The use of such tactics is typically followed by the need to receive commands and conduct further malicious activities, which requires communication with C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs support the notion that after defense evasion, establishing a command and control channel is a likely next step for attackers.
   - Therefore, given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is reasonable to conclude that the Lazarus group would indeed have the backdoors connect to command and control servers.

Final Answer: A
