To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that after the 'versioninfo.bat' script collects system information, the 'stopedge.bat' script will delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to avoid detection. This implies a sequence of actions where an attacker first gathers information and then attempts to cover their tracks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This indicates the use of the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. The 'versioninfo.bat' script likely utilizes this technique to gather system details.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This involves deleting files to evade detection. The action of the 'stopedge.bat' script deleting files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' falls under this category.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The sequence described starts with information gathering (Execution tactic), which is followed by an attempt to evade detection (Defense Evasion tactic).
   - The use of 'versioninfo.bat' for gathering system information aligns with the Execution tactic, specifically using the Windows Command Shell.
   - The subsequent action by 'stopedge.bat' to delete files aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, specifically through file deletion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial action - The 'versioninfo.bat' script collects system information, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - **Step 2**: Understand the purpose of the 'stopedge.bat' script - Its role in deleting files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' suggests an attempt to remove evidence of the attack, fitting the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - **Step 3**: Relate the actions to the provided TTPs - Both the execution of 'versioninfo.bat' for information gathering and the deletion of files by 'stopedge.bat' for evasion are consistent with the tactics and techniques outlined in the related TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the logical sequence of actions (information gathering followed by an attempt to evade detection) and the alignment with the provided TTPs, it is plausible that 'stopedge.bat' would manage the deletion of files to evade detection after 'versioninfo.bat' has completed its task.

Final Answer: A
