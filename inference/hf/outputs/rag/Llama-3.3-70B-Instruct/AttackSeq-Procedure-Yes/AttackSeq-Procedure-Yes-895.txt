To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a shellcode initiates a process to load a DLL (LdrLoadDll) and executes a decrypted payload using the AES128 encryption algorithm. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will hook its main function (DllMain) to evade detection during the defense evasion phase.

2. **Understanding Key Concepts**:
   - **LdrLoadDll**: This is a Windows function used to load DLLs. Malware often uses this or similar functions to load malicious DLLs into memory.
   - **AES128 Encryption Algorithm**: This is a symmetric key block cipher used for encrypting and decrypting data. Malware may use encryption to hide its payload or communications.
   - **DllMain**: This is the entry point for a DLL. Hooking this function can allow malware to intercept and modify the behavior of the DLL, potentially for evasion purposes.
   - **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by malware to evade detection by security products.

3. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection. The use of AES128 in the question aligns with this technique.
   - **T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL by hijacking the search order used by Windows to find DLLs, allowing the malware to load before the legitimate version. While not directly mentioned in the question, the context of loading a DLL (LdrLoadDll) and executing a decrypted payload suggests a scenario where side-loading could be relevant.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a malware is already executing a decrypted payload, indicating an attempt to evade detection (using encryption).
   - The mention of loading a DLL and executing a payload suggests that the malware is attempting to establish a presence on the system without being detected.
   - Hooking the main function (DllMain) of a DLL can be a method to further obscure the malware's activities, aligning with defense evasion tactics.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already demonstrated evasion techniques by using encryption (AES128) to hide its payload.
   - Loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload indicates an attempt to operate stealthily.
   - Given the context of defense evasion and the use of encryption, it is plausible that the malware would attempt to further obscure its presence by hooking its main function (DllMain).

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would likely attempt to hook its main function to evade detection, as this action aligns with the defense evasion tactic and the techniques described.
