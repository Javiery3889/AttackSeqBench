To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial reconnaissance phase where specific system information (network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name) is gathered from the registry. This is followed by a query about whether the Rising Sun implant would likely communicate with specified control servers (e.g., 34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php) using HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control communications. The fact that it specifies web protocols aligns with the use of HTTP POST requests mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry**: This involves querying the registry to gather system information, which matches the initial reconnaissance phase described in the question where registry information is fetched.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves using dynamic resolution to establish command and control channels. While this is relevant to command and control, the question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests to fixed URLs, which doesn't directly imply dynamic resolution but does fit within the broader context of establishing command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of gathering system information from the registry (T1012) is a common first step in many attacks to understand the target environment.
   - The use of HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers (T1071.001) is a plausible next step for command and control purposes, given that web protocols are commonly used for such communications due to their ubiquity and ability to blend in with normal traffic.
   - While T1568 (Dynamic Resolution) is about dynamically resolving domains or addresses for command and control, the question's focus on specific URLs suggests a more direct approach to establishing command and control. However, the use of specific URLs doesn't necessarily preclude the use of dynamic resolution techniques in other parts of the attack chain.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial reconnaissance matches the Discovery tactic, specifically querying the registry (T1012).
   - **Step 2**: The communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests aligns with the Command and Control tactic, specifically using web protocols (T1071.001).
   - **Step 3**: While dynamic resolution (T1568) is part of command and control tactics, the question's specifics about using fixed URLs for HTTP POST requests make T1071.001 the more directly relevant technique.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information gathered and the tactics and techniques described, it is reasonable to conclude that after performing initial reconnaissance, the Rising Sun implant would likely communicate with the specified control servers for command and control purposes using HTTP POST requests.

Final Answer: A
