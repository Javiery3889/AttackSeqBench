To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing contact with Command and Control (C2) servers and performing certain malicious activities (downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files), attackers are likely to automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Exfiltration tactic. Specifically:
   - **T1020: Automated Exfiltration** refers to the automatic exfiltration of data, which could be facilitated by scripts or programs designed to collect and send data out of a network without manual intervention.
   - **T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** refers to the use of an established C2 channel for exfiltrating data from a compromised network. This technique leverages the existing communication channel used for controlling the compromised system to also steal sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies that the attackers have already established a C2 channel, which is a common method for exfiltrating data (as indicated by T1041).
   - The action of downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files suggests that the attackers are setting up infrastructure that could be used for automated tasks, including potentially automated exfiltration (T1020).
   - Given that the attackers have a C2 channel and are engaging in activities that could support automation, it's plausible they could use this setup for exfiltrating sensitive data like AWS credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Establishing a C2 channel is a common precursor to exfiltration activities.
   - **Step 2**: The use of shell scripts and encoded binary files could facilitate automated processes, including exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), it's reasonable to conclude that after establishing a C2 channel and setting up potential automation mechanisms, attackers could indeed use these mechanisms for exfiltrating sensitive information like AWS credentials.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of events includes the automatic exfiltration of AWS credentials over the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: A
