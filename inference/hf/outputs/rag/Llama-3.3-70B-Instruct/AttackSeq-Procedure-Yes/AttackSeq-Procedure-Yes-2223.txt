To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes the use of scanning tools and specific commands during the discovery phase of an attack. The tools and commands mentioned, such as HUC Port Banner Scanner and the command 'hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443', are used for network and port scanning. This phase is crucial for attackers to understand the target network's layout, identify open ports, and discover potential vulnerabilities in remote services. The question then asks if, after this discovery phase, it is likely that Earth Lusca (presumably an attacker or a threat actor) will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the initial phase of using scanning tools to identify potential targets and their network services.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about discovering network services, which is exactly what the scanning tools and commands mentioned in the question are designed to do. Identifying network services is a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities in those services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the discovery phase and the specific TTPs mentioned, the next logical steps for an attacker would be to exploit the discovered services and move laterally within the network. Establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers would facilitate command and control (C2) communications, exfiltration of data, and potentially the introduction of additional malware. This is a common pattern in cyber attacks where initial reconnaissance is followed by exploitation and then lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines activities typical of the discovery phase of a cyber attack.
   - The TTPs provided (T1018 and T1046) directly relate to the actions described in the question.
   - The logical next steps after discovering remote systems and network services would be to exploit vulnerabilities in those services to gain access, and then to establish a persistent presence, which could involve lateral movement and establishing network tunnels.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical progression of a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that after the discovery phase, exploiting remote services and engaging in lateral movement would be a likely next step for an attacker.

Final Answer: A
