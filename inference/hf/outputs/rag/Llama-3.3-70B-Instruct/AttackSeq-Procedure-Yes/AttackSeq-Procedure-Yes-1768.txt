To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after establishing persistence on a compromised host using `rundll32.exe` to modify the registry for startup, is considering the next steps. The question specifically asks if it's likely that the attacker (referred to as "Sayad") would collect system information, details about running processes, open ports, and registered proxies before uploading this data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, **Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves the adversary archiving the collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate. Archiving could involve compressing or encrypting the data.
   - **Tactic: Collection**, **Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the adversary collecting data from the local system, which can include system information, running processes, open ports, and more.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the scenario described fits well within the tactics of collection. After establishing persistence, a common next step for an adversary is to gather as much information as possible about the compromised system to understand its layout, potential vulnerabilities, and valuable data. The techniques T1560 and T1005 directly support this action by outlining the collection and potential archiving of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has established persistence, indicating a desire to maintain access and potentially gather more information.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs (T1560 and T1005) support the collection of system information and archiving of collected data, which aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - **Step 3**: Collecting system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies would be valuable for an attacker to understand the system's security posture and potential avenues for further exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - **Step 4**: Uploading the encrypted collected data to a malicious web server is a plausible next step after collection and archiving, as it allows the adversary to analyze the data further and plan additional attacks.

Given these steps, the scenario described in the question aligns well with common adversary tactics and techniques, making it likely that Sayad would indeed collect the mentioned information before uploading it.

**Final Answer: A**
