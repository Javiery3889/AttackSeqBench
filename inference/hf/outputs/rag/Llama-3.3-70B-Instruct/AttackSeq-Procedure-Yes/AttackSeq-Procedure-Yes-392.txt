To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where system information has been obtained, including details like computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and local IP address. It then asks if it's likely that Vyveva's backdoor will collect files from the computer, compress them with zlib, and transmit them to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves using libraries or built-in utilities to archive files, which could be part of the process of collecting and preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique is about collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the action of gathering files from the computer.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which matches the initial action described in the question (obtaining system information).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial step of obtaining system information (T1082) is a common precursor to more targeted actions like data collection because it helps the attacker understand the environment they are operating in.
   - Collecting files (T1005) is a direct action that follows the initial reconnaissance, fitting the scenario where the backdoor is used to gather specific data from the compromised system.
   - The use of zlib for compression (implied in the context of preparing data for transmission) and the technique of archiving via library (T1560.002) suggest a process of preparing collected data for efficient transmission, which is a logical step after collecting files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already performed system information discovery (T1082), which is a foundational step for further actions.
   - **Step 2**: The collection of files from the local system (T1005) is a plausible next step after reconnaissance, as it aligns with the goal of gathering valuable data.
   - **Step 3**: The use of techniques like archiving via library (T1560.002) for compression and preparation of collected data for transmission supports the scenario of collecting, compressing, and sending files to the C&C server.
   - Given the logical progression from system discovery to data collection and preparation for exfiltration, it is reasonable to conclude that after obtaining system information, Vyveva's backdoor would indeed collect files, compress them, and transmit them to the C&C server.

Final Answer: A
