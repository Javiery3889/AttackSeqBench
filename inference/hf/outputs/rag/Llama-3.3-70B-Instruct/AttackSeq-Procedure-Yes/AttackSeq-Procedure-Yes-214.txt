To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether Elirks malware likely retrieved its command and control (C2) server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites. This implies a method where attackers use social media or similar platforms to hide or communicate the location of their C2 servers, which the malware then accesses to receive further instructions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver, which is a method where an adversary embeds a URL or IP address within a piece of malware that points to a location (like a social media post or a microblog) where the actual C2 server address is hidden or encoded. The malware then resolves this address to find the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique refers to the ability of malware to both send and receive data from a C2 server, but it doesn't directly relate to how the C2 server address is initially obtained.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service**: This is a broader category under which various web service-based command and control techniques fall, including using web services as a means to communicate with malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the description of the techniques, especially **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**, it matches the scenario described in the question. This technique specifically involves using social media or microblog services as a "dead drop" where the malware can find the address of the C2 server.
   - The other techniques, while related to command and control, do not directly address the method of obtaining the C2 server address through social media or microblog services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where malware (Elirks) retrieves its C2 server address from social media or microblog services.
   - The technique **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** directly supports this scenario by describing a method where malware finds its C2 server address through such platforms.
   - Therefore, based on the provided TTPs and the description of the scenario, it is likely that Elirks malware used a method akin to a dead drop resolver to obtain its C2 server address.

Final Answer: A
