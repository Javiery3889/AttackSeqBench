To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has obtained SSH access to a target system and has used `wget` to download malware samples. It then asks if it's likely that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and subsequently deleted by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection. Malware often deletes itself or its components after execution to avoid being detected by security software.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit**: Rootkits are malicious programs designed to hide the presence of malware or other malicious activity from the user and security tools. Loading a kernel module, like the Turbo Linux Kernel Module, could be part of installing a rootkit to hide malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario described involves obtaining access, downloading malware, and then actions that could be related to installing a rootkit (loading a kernel module) and evading detection (deleting files).
   - The Derusbi malware is known for its ability to evade detection and could plausibly use techniques like loading kernel modules (for rootkit functionality) and then deleting files to cover its tracks.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of using file deletion as a method of defense evasion and the use of rootkits (which could involve loading kernel modules) for hiding malicious activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gains SSH access and downloads malware, indicating an intent to execute malicious activities on the target system.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a kernel module (Turbo Linux Kernel Module) suggests an attempt to install a rootkit for hiding malicious activities, aligning with T1014-Rootkit.
   - **Step 3**: The deletion of the kernel module after loading it into the kernel would be a logical step to avoid detection, aligning with T1070.004-File Deletion.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, and the goal of evading detection, it is plausible that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module would be dropped, loaded, and then deleted to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A
