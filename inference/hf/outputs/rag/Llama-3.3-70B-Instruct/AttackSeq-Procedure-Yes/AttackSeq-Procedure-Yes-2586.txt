To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware uses a commercial packer like 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion. After evasion, it queries whether the malware is likely to execute commands to gather system information and send the results back to Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system, which could include IP addresses, network adapters, and routing tables.
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include the operating system version, hardware, and software configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a commercial packer like 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion suggests the malware is designed to avoid detection, which is a common initial step in many malware attacks.
   - The techniques T1016 and T1082 are both under the "Discovery" tactic, which is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle where the attacker seeks to understand the environment they have compromised.
   - Gathering system and network configuration information would be a logical next step after successfully evading defenses, as this information is crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or exfiltration of sensitive data.
   - The mention of specific IP addresses (125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218) as C&C servers implies a mechanism for the malware to communicate back to its operators, which aligns with the need to send gathered information back for further analysis or instruction.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, indicating an attempt to remain undetected on the system.
   - **Step 2**: After evasion, the logical next steps involve gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment.
   - **Step 3**: Techniques T1016 and T1082 are directly related to this information gathering phase.
   - **Step 4**: The presence of C&C servers suggests a need for the malware to communicate back with its operators, which would include sending the gathered system and network information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of defense evasion followed by the need for system and network discovery, and the presence of C&C servers for communication, it is plausible that the malware would execute commands to gather system information and send the results back to the identified IP addresses.

Final Answer: A
