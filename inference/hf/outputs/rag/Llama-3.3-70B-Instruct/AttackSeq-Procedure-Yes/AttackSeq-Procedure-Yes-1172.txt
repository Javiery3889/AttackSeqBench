To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a group conducts vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses. Following this, it queries the likelihood of the group deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services before using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems. This sequence involves reconnaissance (vulnerability scanning), initial access (exploiting vulnerabilities), and potentially persistence or privilege escalation (using stolen credentials).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This indicates the group is gathering information about potential vulnerabilities in the target system, which aligns with the initial step of conducting vulnerability scanning mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This suggests that the group could use identified vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the system, which aligns with deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This implies the group might use external remote services to gain access, which could be facilitated after exploiting public-facing applications or services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The sequence described in the question starts with vulnerability scanning (T1595.002), which is a reconnaissance tactic used to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - The next logical step, based on the provided TTPs, would be to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access (T1190), which involves deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
   - Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access (though not directly listed in the provided TTPs, it implies a tactic of persistence) is a plausible next step after initial access has been gained, as it would allow the attackers to maintain their foothold in the compromised system without relying solely on the exploited vulnerability.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The group conducts vulnerability scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities, aligning with T1595.002.
   - **Step 2**: They deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services to gain initial access, which aligns with T1190.
   - **Step 3**: After gaining initial access, using stolen credentials for persistence is a logical next step, even though the specific TTP for this action isn't listed, it follows the typical attack sequence of gaining access and then maintaining it.
   
Given the logical sequence of events and the tactics and techniques provided, it is reasonable to conclude that after identifying vulnerabilities, a group would attempt to exploit them to gain access and then use other means like stolen credentials to maintain that access.

**Final Answer: A**
