To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Yellow Garuda, uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect specific data from victims' Telegram accounts. The question then asks if it's likely that these collected data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates that the attacker is capable of exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is a common method for transferring stolen data from a compromised system to the attacker's server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This suggests that the attacker collects data from information repositories, which aligns with the use of a 'grabber' tool to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from Telegram accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a 'grabber' tool to collect specific data from Telegram accounts aligns with the Collection tactic, specifically collecting data from information repositories (T1213).
   - The question of whether the data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format involves the Exfiltration tactic. Given that T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is a related TTP, it's plausible that the collected data could be exfiltrated over the web, which could include using a C2 channel for data transfer.
   - The storage in SQLite database and JSON format is a plausible step after exfiltration, as attackers often store stolen data in formats that are easy to manage and analyze, such as databases and JSON files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial action - Data collection from Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the related TTPs, which include exfiltration over a C2 channel and collection from information repositories.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of exfiltrating the collected data over the web, given the T1041 technique.
   - **Step 4**: Assess the likelihood of storing the exfiltrated data in SQLite database and JSON format, considering common practices in data handling by attackers.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is likely that the data collected by Yellow Garuda would be exfiltrated and stored as described.

Final Answer: A
