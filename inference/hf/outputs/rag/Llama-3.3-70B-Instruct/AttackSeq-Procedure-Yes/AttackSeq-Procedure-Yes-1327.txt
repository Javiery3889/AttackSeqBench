To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, using CosmicDuke, has collected information during the Collection phase using tools like a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It then asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. The use of "automated" suggests that once certain conditions are met (like the collection of data), the exfiltration process can proceed without manual intervention.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique is about collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial actions described (using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer).
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over non-command and control (C2) protocols that are not encrypted, such as FTP. The mention of FTP aligns with the question's specifics about uploading collected information via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that CosmicDuke has collected information and the techniques mentioned include automated exfiltration and exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols (like FTP), it suggests that the malware is capable of automatically handling the exfiltration of collected data.
   - The use of stored login credentials for FTP and contacting live remote sites fits within the context of automated exfiltration techniques, especially when considering the use of non-C2 protocols for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities of CosmicDuke in the Collection phase, which include using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the techniques related to Exfiltration, specifically automated exfiltration and exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols.
   - **Step 3**: Match the capabilities and techniques with the actions described in the question (automatic upload via FTP, using stored login credentials, and contacting live remote sites).
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment between the described actions and the techniques associated with CosmicDuke, it is reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information as described.

Final Answer: A
