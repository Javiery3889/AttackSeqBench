To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent phishing emails with a malicious Excel file attachment. The file is suspected to contain a macro that not only displays a fake invoice but also runs malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent. The question asks if it's likely that the Excel file contained such a macro.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This indicates the use of malicious files to execute code on a victim's system. Malicious files can include documents with macros that, when enabled, can run malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This refers to the use of spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system. The attachment is typically designed to be opened by the victim, which then executes the malicious code, allowing the attackers to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario described in the question aligns with the techniques mentioned in the Related TTPs. The use of a malicious Excel file (T1204.002) attached to a spearphishing email (T1566.001) is a common method for initial access and execution of malicious code.
   - The fact that the macro is designed to display a fake invoice while installing ISMAgent in the background fits the profile of sophisticated phishing campaigns like OilRig, which often use social engineering tactics to deceive victims into executing malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the tactics and techniques used by the OilRig campaign as described.
   - **Step 2**: Match these tactics and techniques with the Related TTPs provided (T1204.002 and T1566.001).
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of the malicious Excel file containing a macro that both displays a fake invoice and installs malware, given the context of spearphishing and malicious file execution.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment of the described scenario with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the OilRig campaign and the specifics of the Related TTPs, it is indeed likely that the malicious Excel file contained a macro designed to display a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent.

Final Answer: A
