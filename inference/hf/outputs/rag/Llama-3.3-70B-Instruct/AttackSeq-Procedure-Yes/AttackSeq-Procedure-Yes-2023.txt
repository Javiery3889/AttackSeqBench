To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Seaduke, a type of malware, is used to gather system information and then deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function. The question asks if, after these actions, Seaduke is likely to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of standard web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control communications. This technique is commonly used by malware to blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This refers to the use of standard encoding schemes to hide or obscure the communication between the malware and its C&C server, making it more difficult for defenders to intercept and understand the communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that Seaduke has the capability to securely delete itself after gathering information, it suggests a level of sophistication that includes evasive maneuvers. However, the question of whether it communicates with its C&C server after this action depends on its design and purpose. The use of HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption (as suggested by the related TTPs) is a common method for malware to maintain communication with its C&C servers without being easily detected. 

   The fact that Seaduke can delete itself does not necessarily preclude it from communicating with its C&C server beforehand or as part of its operation before deletion. In fact, the ability to communicate securely and then delete itself could be part of its operational cycle, especially if it's designed to operate in a stealthy manner, gather information, and then remove itself to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Seaduke's ability to gather system information and then delete itself suggests a sophisticated malware with specific objectives.
   - The use of web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control, along with standard encoding, is a common TTP for malware to communicate with C&C servers stealthily.
   - Given Seaduke's capabilities and the described TTPs, it is plausible that it would communicate with its C&C server using these methods before, during, or even as part of its self-deletion process, to report back or receive further instructions.

**Final Answer: A**
