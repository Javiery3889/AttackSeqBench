To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Machete, presumably malware, uses FTP and HTTP for communication with its Command and Control (C&C) servers. It also mentions the optional download of additional files for execution. The key part of the question is about whether Machete automatically copies data from all drives in a compromised system to a removable drive if a specific file is present, as part of its exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This indicates that the adversary is interested in collecting data from removable media, which could imply an interest in data that might be stored on such devices.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This suggests that the adversary has the capability to automatically exfiltrate data from a compromised system, which could include copying data to removable drives as a method of exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the techniques mentioned, the question is whether the presence of a specific file on a removable drive triggers Machete to copy data from all drives to that removable drive. The technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration implies that Machete has the capability for automated exfiltration methods. However, T1025-Data from Removable Media specifically mentions collecting data from removable media, not necessarily copying data to it. The question's scenario, though, involves copying data to a removable drive, which aligns more closely with the concept of exfiltration (especially automated) than the specific technique of collecting data from removable media.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a specific action (copying data from all drives to a removable drive if a certain condition is met) that is part of the exfiltration phase.
   - The provided TTPs indicate capabilities for automated exfiltration and interest in data on removable media.
   - While T1025 focuses on collecting data from removable media, the scenario described in the question involves using a removable drive as a means to exfiltrate data, which aligns with automated exfiltration techniques.
   - Given that the malware is capable of communicating with C&C servers and downloading additional files, it's plausible that it could be programmed to automatically exfiltrate data under certain conditions.
   - Therefore, considering the capabilities implied by the TTPs and the specifics of the question, it seems plausible that Machete could be designed to automatically copy data to a removable drive under the condition described.

Final Answer: A
