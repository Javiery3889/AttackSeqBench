To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malware, Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a, has evaded detection by modifying the firmware update process and preventing event logging. It asks whether this malware is likely capable of wiping server disks to hide its tracks and disrupt operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with **Technique: T1562-Impair Defenses**, which involves impairing the ability of a system to defend itself, making it harder for defenders to detect and respond to the attack.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with **Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**, which is a specific method of defense evasion where an adversary deletes files to hide their tracks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The malware has already demonstrated capabilities under the Defense Evasion tactic by modifying the firmware update process and preventing event logging, which aligns with impairing system defenses (T1562).
   - The capability to wipe server disks would be an extension of the defense evasion tactic, specifically through file deletion (T1070.004), which is aimed at hiding the adversary's tracks and potentially disrupting the target's operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has shown it can evade detection by modifying system processes, indicating a level of sophistication and capability in defense evasion.
   - **Step 2**: The specific techniques mentioned (T1562-Impair Defenses and T1070.004-File Deletion) are both under the Defense Evasion tactic, suggesting that the malware is designed to avoid detection and hide its activities.
   - **Step 3**: Wiping server disks would be a logical extension of the malware's capabilities, as it would further hide its tracks and potentially disrupt operations, aligning with the goals of defense evasion and possibly other tactics like Impact (disruption).
   - **Conclusion**: Given the malware's demonstrated capabilities in evading detection and the relevance of the provided TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a is likely capable of wiping server disks as part of its operations.

Final Answer: A
