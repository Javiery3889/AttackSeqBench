To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after performing discovery activities, the TDrop2 malware is likely to communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands, specifically by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet. This implies a method of communication that involves encoding to evade detection or obscure the content of the communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Command and Control, specifically techniques involving encoding. 
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding** refers to the use of standard encoding schemes (like base64) for communication between malware and C2 servers.
   - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** refers to the use of non-standard encoding schemes, which could include custom or modified versions of standard encoding algorithms, such as using a custom base64 alphabet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the question specifies the use of a "custom base64 alphabet," this directly aligns with the concept of **Non-Standard Encoding (T1132.002)**. The use of a custom alphabet within a base64 encoding scheme is a deviation from the standard base64 encoding, making it a non-standard approach to encode commands for communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario involving the TDrop2 malware communicating with C2 servers.
   - The communication method involves encryption and base64 encoding with a custom alphabet.
   - The related TTPs indicate that non-standard encoding techniques (T1132.002) involve custom or modified encoding schemes.
   - Therefore, the use of a custom base64 alphabet for encoding commands to communicate with C2 servers aligns with the non-standard encoding technique.
   - Given this alignment and the specifics of the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the TDrop2 malware would indeed communicate with C2 servers using such methods after initial discovery activities.

Final Answer: A
