To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about the behavior of Scote malware, specifically how it retrieves Command and Control (C2) information. It mentions the use of legitimate third-party online services to host C2 information and asks if it's likely that the malware retrieves this information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**: This indicates the malware is capable of two-way communication with its C2 server, allowing it to both receive commands and send data back.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1102 - Web Service**: This suggests the malware uses web services for C2 communication. Web services can include a variety of online platforms and services, potentially including those like Pastebin or social media platforms for hosting or communicating C2 information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information and considering the TTPs provided, it's plausible that the malware could use services like Pastebin (a text storage site often used for temporarily sharing text) or even social media platforms (like Google+) to host or communicate C2 information. 
   - The use of web services (T1102) for C2 and the capability for bidirectional communication (T1102.002) support the idea that the malware could retrieve C2 information from such sources before establishing direct communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the behavior of Scote malware in using third-party services for C2 information.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the relevance of TTPs T1102 and T1102.002 in the context of web service usage for C2 and bidirectional communication.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of using services like Pastebin or Google+ for hosting or retrieving C2 information based on the provided TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the TTPs, it is plausible that Scote malware could retrieve C2 information from such sources before communicating with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
