To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an initial exploit (a Flash zero-day exploit) leads to the execution of a second stage shellcode. This shellcode is then expected to download a final payload, known as FinSpy, and establish communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. The question asks if this sequence of events is likely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Flash) to execute malicious code on the victim's system. The fact that a zero-day exploit is used suggests a sophisticated attack aimed at bypassing traditional security measures to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This TTP refers to the use of multiple communication channels by malware to interact with its C2 servers. This can involve initial communication to download additional payloads and subsequent communications for command and control purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploit (T1203) provides the attacker with the capability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, which aligns with the first part of the question (gaining arbitrary read/write memory capabilities to execute a second stage shellcode).
   - The second stage shellcode downloading the final payload (FinSpy) and establishing communication with C2 servers fits the description of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, as it involves multiple stages of communication and payload delivery.
   - Given that the initial exploit is successful and the second stage shellcode is executed, it is logical that the next steps would involve downloading additional malware (FinSpy) and setting up communication channels with C2 servers for further instructions and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial Flash zero-day exploit successfully gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities.
   - **Step 2**: This capability is used to execute a second stage shellcode.
   - **Step 3**: The second stage shellcode is designed to download the final payload (FinSpy), which is a common tactic in multi-stage malware attacks.
   - **Step 4**: Establishing communication with C2 servers for further control is consistent with the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is logical and consistent with known attack patterns that after gaining initial access and executing a second stage shellcode, the next steps would involve downloading a final payload and establishing C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
