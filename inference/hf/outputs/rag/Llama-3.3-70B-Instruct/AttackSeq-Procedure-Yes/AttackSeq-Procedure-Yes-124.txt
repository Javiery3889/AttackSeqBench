To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question mentions the use of an 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. This backdoor is utilized for various malicious activities such as updating relays or downloading files. The mention of a backdoor indicates a level of unauthorized access to the targeted systems, which is a common precursor to more destructive actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This TTP is directly related to the destruction of data on targeted systems. The use of wipers like 'Apostle', which was later turned into functioning ransomware, aligns with this tactic and technique. Wipers are designed to erase data, and their conversion into ransomware adds an additional layer of malicious intent, including financial extortion.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: While this TTP is about evading defenses through file deletion, it also implies an intent to remove traces of malicious activity or to cause damage by deleting important files. This could be seen as a complementary action to data destruction, as both involve damaging or eliminating data, albeit with slightly different primary objectives.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: Given the context of using a backdoor for malicious communications and the deployment of wipers (later converted into ransomware), this option suggests a logical progression of malicious activities. The initial use of a backdoor for updating relays or downloading files could be part of an initial compromise phase. The subsequent deployment of wipers or ransomware aligns with the TTPs related to data destruction and impact, indicating a plausible next step in escalating the attack's severity.
   - **B: No**: This option denies the likelihood of deploying wipers or ransomware after the initial backdoor communication. However, given the malicious context and the related TTPs focused on data destruction and defense evasion through file deletion, this option seems less likely as it does not align with the logical progression of attack tactics.

4. **Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis of the question, the related TTPs, and the evaluation of the answer choices, the most plausible sequence of events involves the initial use of a backdoor for malicious purposes, followed by the deployment of wipers or ransomware to destroy data on targeted systems. This progression aligns with the tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly those related to impact and defense evasion.

Final Answer: A
