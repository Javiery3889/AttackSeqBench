To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Tropic Trooper after exploiting a vulnerability to gain initial access. The actions include dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then using a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. The question asks if this sequence is likely.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the use of exploitation to execute malicious code on a client system, which aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can be used for persistence. The use of wab32res.dll to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: The same technique is listed under defense evasion, indicating that DLL side-loading can also be used to evade detection by hiding malicious code within legitimate processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploitation (T1203) is used to gain access, which is followed by the dropping of a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe). This action suggests an attempt to establish persistence.
   - The use of a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) for DLL side-loading (T1574.002) serves both persistence and defense evasion purposes by injecting a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, a legitimate process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Exploitation**: The attack starts with exploiting a vulnerability, which is a common initial access tactic.
   - **Dropping a Backdoor Installer**: After gaining access, dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) is a logical step for establishing persistence.
   - **DLL Side-Loading**: Using a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe is consistent with both persistence and defense evasion tactics.

Given the logical progression from initial access, to establishing persistence, and then using techniques for both persistence and defense evasion, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns.

**Final Answer: A**
