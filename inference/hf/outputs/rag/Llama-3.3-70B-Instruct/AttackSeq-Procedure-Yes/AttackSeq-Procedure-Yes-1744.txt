To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after using custom tools for privilege escalation, it is likely that the threat group (TG1021) made significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, which is a broad category of tactics used by attackers to evade detection.
   - **Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**, which involves deleting files to hide or destroy evidence of malicious activity.
   - **Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**, which involves modifying tools to remove indicators that could be used for detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of custom versions of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation indicates that TG1021 is capable of modifying tools for their purposes, which aligns with the concept of modifying tools to avoid detection (T1027.005).
   - The technique of file deletion (T1070.004) directly supports the idea of removing disk-resident tools to avoid detection, as deleting files can include removing tools that are stored on disk.
   - Given that both techniques are under the umbrella of Defense Evasion, it suggests that TG1021 is likely employing a strategy to minimize their footprint and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Recognize that the use of custom tools indicates a level of sophistication and intent to evade detection.
   - **Step 2**: Understand that Defense Evasion tactics, including file deletion and indicator removal from tools, are common practices among threat actors to avoid being detected.
   - **Step 3**: Connect the specific techniques (T1070.004 and T1027.005) with the action of removing disk-resident tools as a plausible method for defense evasion.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that after employing custom tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 would likely take steps to avoid detection, including removing evidence of their tools.

Final Answer: A
