To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already employed system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, indicating they have gained access to a system and are gathering information. It then asks if it's likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server over the application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041). This technique involves exfiltrating data from a compromised system through the same channel used for Command and Control (C2), which is a common method used by attackers to maintain stealth and efficiency in their operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the attacker has already gained access and is gathering information, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the gathered data. The technique T1041 directly supports the idea of using the C2 channel for exfiltration. Communicating with a C2 server over the application layer protocol is a plausible method for establishing or maintaining the connection necessary for both receiving commands and exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has gained system access and is gathering information.
   - The next step in a typical attack sequence after information gathering is to exfiltrate the data.
   - The Milestone backdoor, like many backdoors, can be used for both C2 communications and data exfiltration.
   - The related TTP (T1041) specifically mentions exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with using the same channel for both command and control and data exfiltration.
   - Therefore, it is logical that the Milestone backdoor would communicate with a C2 server over the application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel, as this is a common and efficient method for attackers to operate.

**Final Answer: A**
