To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges, aiming to trick victims into divulging sensitive information. The question asks if it's likely that after such an initial step, attackers would use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials and then lock out the original owners by changing account passwords.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts**: This indicates that the attackers are focused on gaining access to existing accounts, which aligns with the goal of collecting usernames, passwords, and email credentials.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation**: This shows that the attackers are using impersonation as a method to evade defenses, which matches the initial step of impersonating technical support or friends.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: Specifically, this technique is about compromising email accounts, which is part of the broader tactic of resource development and directly relates to the collection of email credentials mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial impersonation (T1656-Impersonation) is used to gain the victim's trust.
   - The goal of compromising accounts (T1586-Compromise Accounts) and specifically email accounts (T1586.002-Email Accounts) aligns with the actions described in the question (collecting Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials).
   - Changing account passwords to lock out original owners is a logical next step after compromising accounts, as it secures the attacker's access and prevents easy recovery by the victims.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers use impersonation to deliver phishing messages, which aligns with T1656-Impersonation.
   - **Step 2**: The goal is to compromise accounts, specifically to collect sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and email credentials, which aligns with T1586-Compromise Accounts and T1586.002-Email Accounts.
   - **Step 3**: After compromising these accounts, changing the passwords to lock out the original owners is a logical step to maintain control over the compromised resources.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is indeed likely that after the initial phishing attempt, the attackers would use phishing sites to collect the mentioned credentials and then change account passwords.

Final Answer: A
