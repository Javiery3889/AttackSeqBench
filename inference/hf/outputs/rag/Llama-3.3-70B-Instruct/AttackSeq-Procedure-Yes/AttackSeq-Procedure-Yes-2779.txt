To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an actor-controlled Gmail account, used in a campaign by TA453, impersonates a prominent Israeli physicist. The question asks whether it's likely that phishing emails sent from this account included a link to a TA453-controlled domain, which then presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This indicates that the attackers are using spearphishing with a link as a method to gain initial access. Spearphishing involves sending targeted emails that appear to be from a trusted source, and including a link is a common tactic to trick victims into clicking on it, potentially leading to malicious activities such as credential harvesting.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This suggests that the attackers are also using spearphishing with a link for reconnaissance purposes, possibly to gather information about the target before or after the initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers are using spearphishing with links for both initial access and reconnaissance, it's plausible that the phishing emails would include a link. The fact that the link leads to a TA453-controlled domain that presents a forged Microsoft login page aligns with the technique of using spearphishing for initial access (T1566.002) to harvest credentials.
   - The use of a forged Microsoft login page is a common tactic to trick victims into entering their credentials, thinking they are logging into a legitimate service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers are using spearphishing with links for initial access, which involves tricking victims into clicking on links that may lead to credential harvesting.
   - **Step 2**: The inclusion of a link in the phishing email that leads to a controlled domain is consistent with the described TTPs, especially for initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Presenting a forged Microsoft login page after clicking the link is a known method to harvest user credentials, fitting the initial access tactic.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to the TA453-controlled domain, which then presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

Final Answer: A
