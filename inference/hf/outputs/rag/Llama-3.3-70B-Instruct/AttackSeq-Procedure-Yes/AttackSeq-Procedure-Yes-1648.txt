To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attack group uses a watering hole attack with an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit to gain initial access to a system. Following this initial access, the question asks if it's likely that the group would then adopt and customize Android backdoors, utilize a large infrastructure for Command and Control (C2), and deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This indicates the development of malware, which could include customizing backdoors. The use of malware for resource development suggests that the attackers are investing in creating or modifying tools for their operations.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This refers to gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, which aligns with the watering hole attack described in the question. A drive-by compromise often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software (like the Internet Explorer zero-day mentioned) to gain access without the user's knowledge.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access method described (watering hole attack with a zero-day exploit) matches the **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** technique, indicating that the attackers are capable of sophisticated initial access tactics.
   - The adoption and customization of Android backdoors, as well as the deployment of second-stage backdoors, fall under **Resource Development** and specifically **T1587.001-Malware**. This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers are likely to develop or customize malware (including backdoors) for further exploitation.
   - Utilizing a massive infrastructure for C2 and deploying backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials are actions that would typically follow initial access, as they are part of establishing a persistent presence within the compromised network and facilitating further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers use a sophisticated method for initial access (watering hole attack with a zero-day exploit), which aligns with the **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** technique.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, the attackers are likely to engage in **Resource Development**, which includes customizing malware (like Android backdoors) to suit their needs, as indicated by **T1587.001-Malware**.
   - **Step 3**: The actions described (adopting and customizing backdoors, utilizing a large C2 infrastructure, and deploying second-stage backdoors) are consistent with the tactics an attack group might use after initial access to establish a strong foothold and prepare for further exploitation.
   
Given the information and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after leveraging a watering hole attack for initial access, the attack group would indeed adopt and customize several Android backdoors, utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control, and deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials as part of their operation.

Final Answer: A
