To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have executed 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' to establish backdoor access on infected SK Communications computers. They also installed additional malware to access user databases. The question asks if it's likely that these infected computers communicated with a command and control (C2) server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver, which is a method where malware resolves a domain name to an IP address that is used for command and control. The resolver acts as an intermediary, potentially making it harder to track the actual C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS (Domain Name System) for command and control. Malware can use DNS queries to send and receive data to and from the C2 server, often in a way that blends in with normal DNS traffic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to a specific South Korean IP address (116.127.121.41), this suggests a method of establishing communication that could be used for command and control purposes. 
   - The use of a specific domain resolving to an IP address aligns with the concept of using DNS for command and control (T1071.004-DNS), where the malware could be designed to communicate with the C2 server at the resolved IP address.
   - The mention of a backdoor and additional malware for accessing user databases implies the need for the infected computers to communicate with a C2 server to either receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have established backdoor access and installed additional malware, indicating a need for communication with a C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: The resolution of 'update.alyac.org' to a specific IP address provides a plausible means for this communication, aligning with command and control techniques, especially T1071.004-DNS.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the infected computers would communicate with the C2 server using the resolved IP address.
   
Final Answer: A
