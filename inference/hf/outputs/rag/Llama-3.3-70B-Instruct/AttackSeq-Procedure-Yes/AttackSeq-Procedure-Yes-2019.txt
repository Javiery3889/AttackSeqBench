To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an app, after collecting device information and GPS location, is considered for its likelihood of sending recorded phone calls to a Command and Control (C&C) server for exfiltration before establishing a routine of contacting the C&C server every five minutes to upload additional data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. The use of automated scripts or programs to carry out the exfiltration is a common method.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include device information, GPS location, and potentially recorded phone calls.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is a communication channel used by attackers to control compromised systems and exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario described involves collecting data (device information and GPS location) and potentially recorded phone calls, which aligns with **T1005-Data from Local System**.
   - The act of sending this data to a C&C server for exfiltration purposes aligns with **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.
   - Establishing a routine to upload additional data every five minutes suggests an automated process, which aligns with **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The app collects device information and GPS location, which is a collection tactic.
   - **Step 2**: The question implies that the app is capable of recording phone calls, which would be part of the collection phase.
   - **Step 3**: The app sends recorded phone calls to the C&C server, which is an exfiltration tactic over a C2 channel.
   - **Step 4**: The establishment of a routine to contact the C&C server every five minutes for uploading additional data suggests an automated exfiltration process.
   
Given the logical sequence of events (collection of data, exfiltration of collected data including potentially sensitive information like recorded phone calls, and the establishment of a regular communication channel for further data exfiltration), it is plausible that the app would send recorded phone calls to its C&C server before establishing a routine upload schedule.

**Final Answer: A**
