To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the Darkhotel APT is likely to maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware after deploying specific malware components. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Darkhotel APT, particularly those related to persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of Persistence and the technique of T1547.001, which refers to using Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. This technique is a method used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system by configuring malicious programs to execute automatically during system boot or login.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - The question specifically mentions the deployment of malware components like downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers. These components are typically used for initial access, execution, and privilege escalation, as well as for stealing sensitive information.
    - For these components to continue functioning and for the attackers to maintain access to the compromised system, persistence is crucial. 
    - The technique T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) is a common method used by various threat actors, including APT groups, to achieve persistence. By modifying registry settings, attackers can ensure that their malware runs automatically when the system boots up or a user logs in, thereby maintaining their foothold on the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - **Step 1**: Understand the goal of the Darkhotel APT's actions, which is to maintain access and control over compromised systems.
    - **Step 2**: Recognize the importance of persistence in achieving this goal, allowing the malware to survive system reboots and continue executing without the need for repeated initial access attempts.
    - **Step 3**: Identify the relevance of T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) as a technique for achieving persistence, fitting the context of the question.
    - **Step 4**: Conclude that using autorun registry settings and malware for persistence aligns with the tactics and techniques commonly employed by APT groups like Darkhotel to maintain a presence on compromised systems.

Final Answer: A
