To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec. This deployment is part of the Defense Evasion phase, where the ransomware stops services and disables Windows Defender. The question then asks if, after this phase, it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding a ransom, which falls under the Impact phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact. This technique involves encrypting data to disrupt the availability of the data for impact.
   - Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1489-Service Stop. This technique involves stopping services to disrupt the availability of systems or services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the ransomware has already been deployed and used for defense evasion (stopping services and disabling Windows Defender), the next logical step in the attack sequence, especially considering the tactics and techniques related to the Impact phase, would be to cause significant disruption. Encrypting data (T1486) directly aligns with the behavior of ransomware like WastedLocker, which aims to encrypt data to demand a ransom. Stopping services (T1489) could be a precursor to encryption to ensure that no backups or security measures can interfere with the encryption process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of WastedLocker ransomware and the use of PsExec for defense evasion indicate a sophisticated attack aimed at gaining control and causing disruption.
   - The techniques T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact) and T1489 (Service Stop) are directly related to the Impact phase, which is about causing harm or disruption to the target.
   - Encrypting data and demanding a ransom is a common modus operandi for ransomware attacks, aligning with the described scenario and the provided TTPs.
   - Therefore, given the context and the TTPs, it is logical to conclude that after the initial deployment and defense evasion tactics, the ransomware would proceed to encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom.

Final Answer: A
