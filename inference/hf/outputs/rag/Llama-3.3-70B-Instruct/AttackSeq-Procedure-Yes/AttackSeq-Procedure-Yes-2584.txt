To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where system information has been discovered, including hostname, user details, and active TCP connections. It then asks if it's likely that the malware communicates with identified Command and Control (C&C) servers using application layer protocols.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols. This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for communication between the malware and the C&C server. Web protocols are application layer protocols.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095 - Non-Application Layer Protocol. This technique involves using protocols that are not at the application layer (e.g., DNS tunneling, which uses a protocol at a lower layer for C&C communication).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the discovery of system information and then asks about communication with C&C servers. Typically, after such discovery, malware would need to communicate with its C&C servers to exfiltrate the gathered information or receive further instructions.
   - Given that T1071.001 (Web Protocols) is listed as a related TTP, it suggests that the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C&C communication is a relevant consideration.
   - The mention of specific IP addresses (125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218) implies a direct form of communication, which is often facilitated by application layer protocols for ease of communication and to blend in with normal network traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The scenario involves the discovery of system information, which is a common precursor to C&C communication.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs include the use of web protocols for C&C, which are application layer protocols.
   - **Step 3**: The question specifically asks about communication with C&C servers using application layer protocols, which aligns with the use of web protocols (T1071.001).
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware would use application layer protocols to communicate with the identified C&C servers.

Final Answer: A
