To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already gathered detailed system information and file listings, likely using specific components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) during the Discovery phase. It then asks if it's plausible that the malware would archive the collected data using a custom XOR operation for obfuscation before exfiltrating it during the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Collection) and a technique (T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method). This technique specifically mentions archiving data via a custom method, which could include using a custom XOR operation for obfuscation. The Collection tactic is about gathering information relevant to the attacker's goals, which aligns with the scenario described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Answer Choice A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that after discovering system information, the next logical step for the malware would be to archive the collected data using a custom method (like a custom XOR operation) for obfuscation before exfiltrating it. This aligns with the described TTP (T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method) and is a common practice to evade detection.
    - **Answer Choice B (No)**: This choice implies that archiving collected data with a custom XOR operation for obfuscation before exfiltration is not a likely next step. However, given the context of the Collection tactic and the specific technique of archiving via a custom method, this seems less likely.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question outlines a scenario where detailed system information has been collected, indicating the attacker is in the Collection phase.
    - The use of specific components for discovery suggests a targeted approach, which often involves custom methods for data handling to avoid detection.
    - The related TTP (T1560.003 - Archive via Custom Method) directly supports the idea of using custom methods for archiving collected data, which could include a custom XOR operation for obfuscation.
    - Given the context and the TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed use such methods to protect the exfiltrated data.

Final Answer: A
