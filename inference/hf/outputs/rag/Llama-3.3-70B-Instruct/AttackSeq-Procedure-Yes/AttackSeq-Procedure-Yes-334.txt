To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the skip-2.0 backdoor has been executed using the SessionEnv service. It mentions potential persistence through DLL hijacking of the TSVIPSrv.DLL file. The question then asks if the skip-2.0 backdoor is likely to employ a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a DLL by placing a malicious version of it in a location where it will be loaded before the legitimate version, allowing an adversary to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process, often by taking advantage of the way Windows loads DLLs, to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This is the same technique as mentioned above but used for persistence, indicating that an adversary is using DLL hijacking not just for defense evasion but also to maintain access to a system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: Given that the skip-2.0 backdoor has already utilized DLL hijacking (specifically, TSVIPSrv.DLL) for potential persistence, and considering the techniques provided, the use of a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion would align with the tactics of defense evasion and potentially complement the persistence achieved through DLL hijacking. VMProtected launchers could be used to evade detection by making the backdoor's execution appear more legitimate or by complicating analysis in a virtualized environment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The skip-2.0 backdoor has already demonstrated the use of sophisticated techniques for persistence and initial execution.
   - The use of DLL hijacking for persistence indicates a level of complexity and intent to evade detection.
   - Employing a VMProtected launcher would be consistent with the tactics of defense evasion, especially considering the adversary has already shown an ability to use complex techniques like DLL hijacking.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the skip-2.0 backdoor would employ additional defense evasion techniques, such as using a VMProtected launcher, to further protect its operations from detection.

Final Answer: A
