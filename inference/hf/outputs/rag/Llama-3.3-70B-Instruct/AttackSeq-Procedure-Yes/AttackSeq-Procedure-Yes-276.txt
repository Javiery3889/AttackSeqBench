To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a system, often leveraging user interaction (like opening the document) to execute malicious code.

2. **Execution and Defense Evasion**: The question mentions the use of a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') and the decoding of a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'. This involves two key TTPs:
   - **T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including downloading additional payloads.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about making encoded or obfuscated data readable and executable. In this context, it refers to decoding the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.

Given these points, the sequence of events described in the question involves:
- Initial access through a malicious document.
- Execution of a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1').
- The PowerShell script decodes a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.
- The decoded script's purpose is not explicitly stated, but it's implied to be part of the malware payload or a component that aids in the attack.

The question asks whether it's likely that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access vector (malicious Word document in a ZIP file) suggests a phishing or spear-phishing attack, which is a common method for delivering malware.
2. The use of PowerShell for execution (T1059.001) is a flexible and powerful method for attackers to perform various tasks, including downloading files and executing scripts.
3. The decoding of a base64 encoded script (T1140) is a defense evasion technique, suggesting the attackers are trying to hide their intentions or the script's functionality from detection.
4. The sequence of decoding and then potentially downloading additional components makes logical sense, as the decoded script could contain instructions or components necessary for the next stages of the attack, including downloading a zip file with the malware payload.

**Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs involved, it is plausible that the 'fmx.ps1' script would first decode and potentially execute or utilize the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' as part of setting up or preparing for the download of additional malware components. This would align with a sophisticated attack sequence where initial scripts prepare the environment for the main payload.

**Final Answer: A**
