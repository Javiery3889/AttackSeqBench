To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a BlackEnergy dropper is executed through a malicious Word document's VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will ensure its persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder and using it to execute a command before connecting to a hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This TTP indicates that an adversary may achieve persistence by adding entries to the startup folder or modifying registry run keys, which allows the malware to execute upon system startup.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This TTP involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts for execution. In the context of the question, it's related to the use of VBA macros in Word documents to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial execution vector is through a VBA macro in a Word document, aligning with **T1059.005-Visual Basic**.
   - The question then describes a method for achieving persistence by creating a LNK file in the startup folder. This directly aligns with **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**, as placing a LNK file in the startup folder is a method to ensure the malware runs upon system startup.
   - Connecting to a hardcoded C&C server is a common behavior for malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data, which is a plausible next step after establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware is executed through a VBA macro, which is a known technique for initial access and execution.
   - **Step 2**: The creation of a LNK file in the startup folder for persistence is a technique that aligns with the provided TTPs, specifically **T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**.
   - **Step 3**: Connecting to a C&C server is a logical step for the malware to receive commands or send stolen data, following the establishment of persistence.
   - Given the alignment of these steps with known TTPs and the logical progression of a malware attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the described sequence of events is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
