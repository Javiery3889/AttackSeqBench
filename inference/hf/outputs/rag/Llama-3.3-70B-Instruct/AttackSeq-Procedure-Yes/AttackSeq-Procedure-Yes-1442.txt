To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) is exploited via email attachments to drop the Taidoor malware. This exploitation leads to the opening of a decoy document, which suggests an initial access tactic. The question then inquires about the likelihood of Taidoor evolving to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its Command and Control (CnC) servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. The scenario described fits this technique, as the exploitation of the Microsoft Office vulnerability leads to the execution of the Taidoor malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves gaining initial access to a system through spearphishing with an attachment. The use of email attachments to deliver the exploit aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial steps described (exploiting a vulnerability via email attachments and opening a decoy document) align with the provided TTPs, indicating a focused attack to gain initial access and execute malicious code.
   - The question of whether Taidoor will evolve to avoid detection before communicating with its CnC servers involves considering the typical behaviors of malware like Taidoor. Malware often evolves to evade detection, and using modified traffic patterns to communicate with CnC servers is a common tactic to avoid signature-based detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access and execution techniques used are consistent with known TTPs for gaining access to a system and executing malware.
   - **Step 2**: The nature of the Taidoor malware and its goal of communicating with CnC servers suggests that evasion techniques would be beneficial for its operation.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of the attack and the goals of the malware, evolving to avoid detection is a plausible next step for maintaining the integrity of the attack and the malware's ability to communicate with its CnC servers without being detected.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided information and the typical behaviors of malware, it is reasonable to conclude that Taidoor would likely evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

Final Answer: A
