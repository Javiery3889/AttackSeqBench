To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial access scenario where the attacker uses spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables to gain access to a system. It then asks if it's likely that the malware TDrop2 would use process hollowing for execution to evade detection before moving on to discovery activities like gathering system information and network views.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This is about gaining initial access to a system through phishing, which aligns with the spear-phishing described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves hollowing out a legitimate process and replacing its contents with malicious code to evade detection. This is relevant to evading detection after initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: While process hollowing is primarily associated with defense evasion, it can also be used in the context of privilege escalation by hollowing a process that runs with higher privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where initial access has been achieved through phishing, which matches the first related TTP.
   - The use of process hollowing (T1055.012) for defense evasion is a plausible next step after initial access to maintain a low profile within the system. This technique allows malware to blend in with legitimate system processes, making it harder for security software to detect.
   - The engagement in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views is a common step after establishing a foothold in a system. These activities would typically follow evasion techniques to ensure the malware remains undetected while it gathers intelligence on the system and network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Initial access is gained through spear-phishing, aligning with T1566-Phishing.
   - **Step 2**: To evade detection after gaining access, using process hollowing (T1055.012) is a logical step for executing malware without being detected.
   - **Step 3**: After evading detection, the malware would likely proceed with discovery activities to understand the system and network better, which is a common post-exploitation tactic.
   
Given the logical progression from initial access, through evasion techniques, to discovery activities, and considering the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence involves using process hollowing for execution to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A**
