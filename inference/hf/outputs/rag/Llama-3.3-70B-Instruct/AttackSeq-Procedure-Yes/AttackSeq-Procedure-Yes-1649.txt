To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after gaining initial access through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, an attack group is likely to use phishing domains to gather user credentials during the reconnaissance phase. This implies a sequence of actions where initial access is gained through exploitation of a vulnerability, and then the attackers move to gather more information or credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Reconnaissance tactic. Specifically:
   - **T1589.001 - Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which could be through various means including phishing.
   - **T1590.001 - Domain Properties**: This involves gathering information about domain properties, which could be related to understanding the target environment but doesn't directly imply credential gathering.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence where initial access is gained, and then the attackers are looking to gather more information, specifically credentials.
   - **T1589.001 - Credentials** directly relates to gathering credentials, which aligns with the idea of using phishing domains to collect user credentials.
   - **T1590.001 - Domain Properties** is more about understanding the domain environment, which might be part of reconnaissance but doesn't directly support the use of phishing for credential gathering.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained initial access, indicating they are past the first stage of the attack.
   - The question specifically asks about gathering user credentials during the reconnaissance phase, which aligns with **T1589.001 - Credentials**.
   - Using phishing domains is a plausible method for gathering credentials, fitting the context of the question and the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the attack group could use phishing domains as part of their reconnaissance to gather user credentials.

Final Answer: A
