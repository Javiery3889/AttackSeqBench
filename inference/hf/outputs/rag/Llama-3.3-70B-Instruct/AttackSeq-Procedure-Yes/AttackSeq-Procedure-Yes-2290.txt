To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the DNSpionage malware, which uses defense evasion techniques such as password-protected macros and string obfuscation. It then asks if, after employing these techniques, the malware is likely to enter a discovery phase to gather specific information about the infected system (username, hostname, domain) before establishing command and control (C2) communication with its server using HTTP and DNS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**: This involves techniques used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems, issue commands, and receive stolen data.
   - **Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This is a specific technique under the Command and Control tactic that involves using DNS for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**: This tactic includes techniques used by attackers to evade detection by security systems.
   - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves the process of decoding or deobfuscating files or information that was previously encoded or obfuscated to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the DNSpionage malware using defense evasion techniques to likely avoid detection, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to gather information about the infected system. This information (username, hostname, domain) is crucial for the attackers to understand the environment they are operating in, which can inform their next steps, including how to communicate effectively with the compromised system without being detected. The use of HTTP and DNS for C2 communication aligns with the provided TTPs, especially T1071.004-DNS, indicating that after evading defenses and potentially deobfuscating necessary components, the malware would indeed seek to establish a means of controlled communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware first employs defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - After evasion, the logical next step would be to gather system information to understand the environment.
   - The gathered information would then be used to facilitate effective C2 communication.
   - The use of DNS for C2 communication, as indicated by T1071.004-DNS, supports the notion that after the discovery phase, the malware would use HTTP and DNS for communication with the C2 server.
   
Final Answer: A
