To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign has established communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. This communication is facilitated through protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The question then inquires about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel, specifically mentioning the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the **Technique: T1573.002 - Asymmetric Cryptography**. This indicates the use of asymmetric cryptography (like RSA) for secure communication, which aligns with the mention of RSA-secured AES key exchanges in the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This suggests that exfiltrating data over an established C2 channel is a plausible action within the context of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication (as mentioned in the question) aligns with the TTPs provided, specifically the use of asymmetric cryptography for secure communication (T1573.002).
   - The established C2 channel, secured with such cryptographic measures, would provide a secure means for exfiltrating data, which is consistent with the exfiltration over a C2 channel technique (T1041).
   - Given that the SombRAT backdoor is mentioned in the context of an already established C2 channel with robust security measures in place, it is reasonable to infer that this backdoor could utilize the existing secure communication channel for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where a secure C2 channel has been established, utilizing protocol tunneling and cryptographic techniques for security.
   - The related TTPs support the use of secure communication for C2 and the exfiltration of data over such channels.
   - The mention of specific cryptographic techniques (SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges) for securing the C2 communication suggests a high level of security, which would be consistent with the need to protect exfiltrated data.
   - Therefore, given the established secure C2 channel and the TTPs indicating the use of such channels for exfiltration, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor would exfiltrate data over this channel.

Final Answer: A
