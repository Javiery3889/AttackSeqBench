To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving WinDealer, which executes by reading a configuration file and loading a DLL module. It then asks if WinDealer is likely to discover data from SNS (Social Network Service) applications before categorizing the collected data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This indicates that the malware (WinDealer) is capable of automatically collecting data. This could include data from various sources, potentially including SNS applications, but the technique itself doesn't specify the source of the data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This suggests that the malware is capable of discovering files and directories on the compromised system. This could be a precursor to collecting data, as understanding the file system layout is crucial for targeted data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: execution, potential discovery of SNS data, and then categorization of collected data. 
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is a technique that would logically precede **T1119-Automated Collection** because discovering where data is stored (including SNS application data) would facilitate the automated collection of that data.
   - Given that WinDealer loads a DLL module and has automated collection capabilities, it's reasonable to infer that it could discover data locations (including those of SNS applications) as part of its operation, especially if it's designed to collect specific types of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: WinDealer executes and loads necessary components, indicating it's preparing for its primary functions.
   - **Step 2**: For WinDealer to collect data effectively (especially from specific applications like SNS), it would need to discover where that data is stored, which aligns with **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.
   - **Step 3**: After discovering the location of the data, WinDealer could then collect the data, which includes SNS application data, aligning with **T1119-Automated Collection**.
   - **Step 4**: Finally, categorizing the collected data into different directories as ".a" files suggests a level of organization in the data collection process, which would logically follow the discovery and collection of data.

Given the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that WinDealer would likely discover data from SNS applications as part of its collection process before categorizing the data. This sequence aligns with the tactics and techniques provided.

Final Answer: A
