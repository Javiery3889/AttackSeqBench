To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific scenario where attackers exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) in MS Exchange for initial access. Following this, it suggests the use of DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor and then stealing domain authentication credentials.

2. **Understanding the Exploited Vulnerability**: CVE-2021-26855 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the server. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190).

3. **Analyzing Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application, which directly relates to the initial access method described in the question (exploiting CVE-2021-26855). This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems to gain access to an organization's network.

4. **Evaluating the Sequence of Actions**:
   - **Initial Access**: The exploitation of CVE-2021-26855 for initial access is a plausible and documented method used by attackers.
   - **DLL Hijacking and ShadowPad Execution**: DLL hijacking is a technique (T1574) that can be used to execute malicious code, such as the ShadowPad backdoor, by exploiting the way Windows loads DLLs. This could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access, as it allows attackers to execute their tools within the compromised environment.
   - **Stealing Domain Authentication Credentials**: After establishing a foothold and executing a backdoor, stealing domain authentication credentials is a common objective for attackers to move laterally within the network and maintain persistence.

5. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given the context of exploiting a public-facing application for initial access and the subsequent actions described, the sequence of exploiting a vulnerability, using DLL hijacking to execute a backdoor, and then stealing credentials aligns with common attack patterns. The use of ShadowPad, a known backdoor, and the objective of stealing domain authentication credentials are consistent with tactics used by sophisticated threat actors to establish persistence and facilitate further malicious activities.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided information and the analysis of the attack sequence, it is plausible that after exploiting CVE-2021-26855 for initial access, attackers could use DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor as part of their tactics to steal domain authentication credentials.
