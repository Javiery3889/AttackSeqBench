To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit is delivered via email. The exploit uses ActionScript to extract itself from the document. The question asks whether it is likely that BlackOasis (a known APT group) will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution**: This tactic involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.
   - **Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in client applications to execute code. The scenario described fits this technique because it involves exploiting a Flash zero-day vulnerability in a client application (likely a web browser or Microsoft Office, given the context of a malicious document).
   - **Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using malicious files to gain execution. The malicious Microsoft Office document with a Flash zero-day exploit falls under this category.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario described involves delivering a malicious document (T1204.002) that exploits a client-side vulnerability (T1203) to execute code. This is a common method used by various threat actors, including APT groups like BlackOasis, to gain initial access to a system.
   - The use of a zero-day exploit in a Flash object within a Microsoft Office document to execute shellcode is a sophisticated method that aligns with the tactics and techniques used by advanced threat actors.
   - Given that the exploit is designed to extract and execute shellcode, and considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the execution of the second stage shellcode is part of the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access vector - a malicious Microsoft Office document with a Flash zero-day exploit delivered via email.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the exploitation technique - using a zero-day exploit in a client application (T1203) to execute code.
   - **Step 3**: Understand the role of the malicious file (T1204.002) in delivering the exploit.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the typical behavior of APT groups like BlackOasis in using sophisticated exploits for initial access and executing shellcode for further malicious activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the related TTPs, it is likely that BlackOasis would execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object extracts the exploit, as this aligns with the described tactics and techniques.

Final Answer: A
