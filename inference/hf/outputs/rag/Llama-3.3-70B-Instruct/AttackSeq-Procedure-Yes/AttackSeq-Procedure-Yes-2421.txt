To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where attackers have already escalated privileges within a Windows network by exploiting control weaknesses and have compromised the Enterprise Admin account. This suggests they have significant access and control within the network. The question then asks if it's likely that the attackers would compromise a third-party processor's network, use captured credentials to access this network, and then conduct reconnaissance on the card processing service.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This TTP involves using external services to maintain access to a network. This could include using compromised credentials to access external services that have access to the target network.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts (which could be compromised or stolen) to escalate privileges within a network. The fact that the attackers have already compromised the Enterprise Admin account indicates they have successfully used valid accounts for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already demonstrated the ability to escalate privileges and have compromised high-level accounts, it's reasonable to assume they could use these privileges to access other networks or services that the compromised accounts have access to.
   - The use of captured credentials (valid accounts) to connect to the third-party processor's network aligns with T1078-Valid Accounts. This technique is about leveraging valid credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges, which fits the scenario of accessing a third-party network.
   - Conducting reconnaissance on the card processing service after gaining access would be a logical next step for attackers aiming to understand the environment and plan further malicious activities, which could involve using external remote services (T1133) for persistence or further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already demonstrated advanced capabilities in privilege escalation and network compromise.
   - The use of valid accounts for further network access and the potential for using external services for persistence are well-aligned with the provided TTPs.
   - Given the context and the TTPs, it is plausible that after compromising the bank's network, attackers would attempt to expand their access to connected or related networks, such as a third-party processor's, especially if their goal involves disrupting or exploiting financial transactions.

Final Answer: A
