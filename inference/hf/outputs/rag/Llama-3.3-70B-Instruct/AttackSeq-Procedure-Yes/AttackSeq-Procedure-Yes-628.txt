To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename and '.tmp' extension. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to evade detection and bypass security controls. 
   - **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves disguising or hiding malicious data or files to avoid detection. Obfuscation can be used to make it difficult for security software to detect the malware.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This tactic involves techniques used by adversaries to gather information about the system or network they are attacking.
   - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries attempting to discover files and directories on the system, which can be used for various purposes, including identifying potential targets for further exploitation or places to hide malicious files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the malware rewriting itself to a temporary location with a randomized filename, which already suggests an attempt to evade detection by not using a predictable or static location.
   - The use of a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension can be seen as a basic form of evasion, aiming to blend in with other temporary files.
   - Given the context of Defense Evasion and the specific technique of Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027), it's reasonable to infer that the malware would continue to employ evasion techniques, including obfuscation, to minimize its visibility and avoid detection.
   - While the Discovery tactic and File and Directory Discovery technique (T1083) are related to understanding the environment, they don't directly answer the question about evasion and obfuscation but do indicate that an adversary is interested in understanding the system layout, which could precede or follow evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's action of rewriting itself to a temporary location with a randomized filename indicates an initial step in evasion.
   - The use of evasion techniques, such as obfuscation, aligns with the tactic of Defense Evasion and the specific technique of Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027).
   - Given the context and the related TTPs, it is logical to conclude that the malware would indeed employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
   
Final Answer: A
