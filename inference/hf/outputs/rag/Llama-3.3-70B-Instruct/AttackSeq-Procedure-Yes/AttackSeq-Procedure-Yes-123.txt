To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after receiving commands from C2 (Command and Control) servers, the 'IPsec Helper' is involved in sending recon information or downloading files. It then asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper (which initially failed execution) and the 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction purposes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to two main tactics:
   - **Tactic: Impact**, with the technique **T1485-Data Destruction**: This indicates an intention to disrupt or destroy data, which aligns with the deployment of wipers or malware designed to overwrite files.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with the technique **T1070.004-File Deletion**: This suggests methods used to evade detection, including deleting files to remove evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the deployment of the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction. This action is directly related to the **Tactic: Impact** and specifically the **Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**, as both the wiper and the malware are tools that can be used to destroy or overwrite data.
   - The initial failure of the 'Apostle' wiper does not necessarily preclude its redeployment, especially if the attackers believe it could still be effective or if they have made modifications to ensure its success.
   - The use of 'DEADWOOD' malware for overwriting files also aligns with data destruction activities, fitting the described TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal mentioned in the question, which is data destruction.
   - **Step 2**: Match this goal with the provided TTPs, noting that data destruction is a key aspect of the Impact tactic.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the tools mentioned ('Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware) and their alignment with the TTPs related to data destruction and defense evasion.
   - **Step 4**: Given the context and the TTPs, determine the likelihood of Agrius deploying these tools as part of its data destruction activities.

**Final Answer: A**
