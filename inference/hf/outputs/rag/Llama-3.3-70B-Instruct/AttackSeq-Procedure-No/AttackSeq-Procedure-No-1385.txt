To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the question and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FIN13, presumably a threat actor, uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE. This backdoor establishes a local HTTP server for command execution, indicating a method for maintaining access and control over a compromised system. The question then asks if, after establishing this form of access, FIN13 would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, but only after using other methods to establish persistence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of BLUEAGAVE for establishing an HTTP server for command execution.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This suggests the use of web shells to maintain persistence within a compromised environment, which could be a follow-up action after initial access.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the command and control channel, which could be relevant to how FIN13 maintains access and issues commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of BLUEAGAVE for establishing a local HTTP server indicates that FIN13 has already gained some level of access to the target system.
   - The deployment of web shells and custom malware for initial access seems redundant if BLUEAGAVE is already used for command execution. However, the question specifies "only after using other methods to establish persistence," which implies that the initial access might have been achieved through BLUEAGAVE or similar means, and the focus is on subsequent actions for persistence and further control.
   - The related TTPs suggest a focus on command and control as well as persistence, which aligns with the scenario of using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that FIN13 has already established a means of command and control through BLUEAGAVE, the next logical steps would involve ensuring persistence and possibly expanding control within the compromised environment.
   - The use of web shells (T1505.003) and custom malware could be part of expanding this control, but the question's phrasing about "only after using other methods to establish persistence" suggests a sequence where initial access is already achieved, and the focus is on what happens next.
   - Therefore, it seems plausible that after establishing initial access and command and control through passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 would indeed exploit external servers to deploy additional tools for persistence and control, such as web shells and custom malware, as part of their tactics for maintaining and expanding access.

Final Answer: A
