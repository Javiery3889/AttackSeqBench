To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder, is considering the next steps for the Rising Sun implant. The actions in question involve collecting browser bookmark information as part of the discovery phase and then communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for communication between the implant and the control servers. The use of HTTP POST requests falls under this category, as it's a method of sending data to a server to create or update a resource.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This involves collecting information about the browsers on the compromised system, which could include bookmark information. This technique is part of the discovery phase, where the attacker gathers information about the system and its environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question asks if, after establishing persistence, the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect browser bookmark information (part of discovery) before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - Given the tactics and techniques provided, collecting browser information (including bookmarks) aligns with the discovery phase (T1217), which is a common step after establishing persistence to understand the environment better.
   - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests (T1071.001) is a plausible next step after the discovery phase, as the implant would need to send back the collected information or receive further instructions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has ensured persistence, which is a prerequisite for long-term access and control.
   - **Step 2**: The next logical step would involve discovery to gather more information about the system and its users, which could include collecting browser bookmark information.
   - **Step 3**: After or during the discovery phase, the implant would likely communicate with the control servers to either send collected data or receive new commands, which aligns with using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the provided TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rising Sun implant would indeed collect browser bookmark information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers.

Final Answer: A
