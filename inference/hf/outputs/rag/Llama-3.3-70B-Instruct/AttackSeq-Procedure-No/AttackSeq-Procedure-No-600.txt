To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase. This phase follows the initial access established through malicious documents containing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This indicates the adversary is scanning IP blocks, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is used to discover services running on the network, which aligns with the Discovery phase where an adversary tries to understand the network layout and services.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This involves using Visual Basic (or VBA) for execution, which is a method to execute malicious code, in this case, likely used for initial access through malicious documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Sednit group is known for sophisticated attacks, often targeting government and critical infrastructure. The use of VBA macros in documents for initial access (T1059.005) is a common tactic for such groups to gain a foothold in a network.
   - After establishing initial access, the next logical steps would involve reconnaissance and discovery to understand the network and identify potential vulnerabilities. Scanning IP blocks (T1595.001) and network service discovery (T1046) are techniques that fit within these phases, helping the adversary to map out the network and find exploitable services or vulnerabilities.
   - Given the context of targeting government and critical infrastructure, it's reasonable to assume that the Sednit group would indeed be interested in scanning IP ranges for vulnerability scanning as part of their Discovery phase, following the initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Sednit group uses malicious documents with VBA macros for initial access.
   - Post-initial access, the group would logically proceed with reconnaissance and discovery activities.
   - Scanning IP blocks and network service discovery are consistent with the tactics used during the Discovery phase.
   - Given the group's target profile (government and critical infrastructure), vulnerability scanning in the Discovery phase aligns with their objectives.

Final Answer: A
