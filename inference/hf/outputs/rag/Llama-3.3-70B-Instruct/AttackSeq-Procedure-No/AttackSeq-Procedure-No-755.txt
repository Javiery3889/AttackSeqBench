To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing communication with control servers for command and control (C2) purposes, the Rising Sun implant likely performed initial reconnaissance. This involves understanding the context of how malware or implants typically operate after establishing C2 communication. The question specifically mentions the implant communicating via HTTP POST requests, which is a common method for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Discovery and Exfiltration tactics. 
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** and **T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery** are techniques under the Discovery tactic, indicating actions an adversary might take to gather information about the system and network they have compromised. This includes discovering the network configuration and internet connectivity, which are crucial for further operations, including lateral movement and exfiltration.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is a technique under the Exfiltration tactic, which involves transferring data from the compromised system to the adversary's system, often using the established C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the Rising Sun implant has established C2 communication, the next logical steps in an attack sequence would involve gathering more information about the compromised system and network to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or exfiltration of sensitive data. The techniques T1016 and T1016.001 directly support the idea of performing initial reconnaissance to understand the network and system layout, which would be necessary before exfiltrating data (as indicated by T1041).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Rising Sun implant's communication with control servers via HTTP POST requests indicates an established C2 channel.
   - The related TTPs suggest that after establishing C2, an adversary would likely engage in discovery activities to understand the system and network.
   - Techniques T1016 and T1016.001 are directly related to gathering system and network information, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that after establishing C2, the Rising Sun implant would perform initial reconnaissance, which includes decrypting and collecting network and system information.

Final Answer: A
