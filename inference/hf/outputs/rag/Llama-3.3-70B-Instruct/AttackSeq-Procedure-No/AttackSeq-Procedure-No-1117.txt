To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker attempts lateral movement using the `net use` command. After this attempt, it queries whether the attacker is likely to confirm communication with the target device via a `ping` command only after using compromised legitimate websites as Command and Control (C2) servers for communication.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using one or more legitimate websites as a mechanism for communication. The attacker might use these websites to send and receive commands or data, blending in with normal traffic to avoid detection.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary checking if the compromised system has internet access. This could be a preliminary step to establish if the system can be used for further malicious activities, including communicating with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of `net use` for lateral movement indicates the attacker is trying to access or manipulate resources on the network.
   - The question of confirming communication via a `ping` command after using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers involves understanding the purpose of each step. The `ping` command is typically used to verify connectivity, which aligns with the Discovery tactic, specifically checking for internet connectivity (T1016.001).
   - Using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers (T1205-Traffic Signaling) is a method to hide malicious communication in plain sight, making it less likely to be detected. This does not directly relate to the act of confirming connectivity but rather to how commands or data are sent and received once communication is established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker attempts lateral movement, indicating a need to access or manipulate network resources.
   - The use of compromised legitimate websites for C2 communication is about hiding the communication channel, not about verifying connectivity.
   - Confirming communication via a `ping` command is more about ensuring the target device is reachable over the network, which aligns with the Discovery tactic, specifically internet connection discovery.
   - Given the context, the attacker might use a `ping` command to verify connectivity as part of their discovery and setup process, but this is not directly contingent on using compromised websites as C2 servers. The `ping` command could be used at various stages of the attack, including before or after establishing C2 communication, depending on the attacker's needs.

**Final Answer: B**
