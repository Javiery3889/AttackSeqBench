To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, after conducting discovery activities using tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather Active Directory information, is suspected of accessing files from victims' OneDrive environments. Following this, the actor allegedly used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally through the environment. The question asks if this sequence of actions is likely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**, with the **Technique: T1078.002 - Domain Accounts**. This suggests the threat actor is using domain accounts to escalate privileges, which aligns with the use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**, with the **Technique: T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol**. This indicates the actor is using RDP for moving laterally within the compromised environment, which directly matches the description in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the TTPs, the threat actor's actions as described (using AdFind and custom PowerShell for discovery, accessing OneDrive, and then using RDP for lateral movement with varying account privileges) fit within the context of the provided TTPs. The use of domain accounts for privilege escalation (T1078.002) and RDP for lateral movement (T1021.001) are directly mentioned in the related TTPs, supporting the plausibility of the described sequence of events.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actor's initial actions (discovery using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets) suggest an interest in understanding the Active Directory structure, which is a common precursor to targeted attacks.
   - Accessing files from OneDrive environments could provide additional information useful for further exploitation or lateral movement.
   - The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP aligns with the TTPs provided, especially T1021.001 for lateral movement and T1078.002 for privilege escalation using domain accounts.
   - Given the alignment of these actions with known TTPs and the logical progression of an attack (from discovery, to exploitation, to lateral movement), it is reasonable to conclude that the described sequence of events is plausible.

Final Answer: A
