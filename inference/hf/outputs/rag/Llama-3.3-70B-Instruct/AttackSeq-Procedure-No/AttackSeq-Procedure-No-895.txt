To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the InfoOS module collects system information, which is a precursor to potential data collection or exfiltration activities. It then asks if the XAgent component would communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server to receive commands via the HTTPChannel module only after sending a hello message.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating information from a system without direct operator interaction. The use of modules like InfoOS for gathering system information could be a precursor to this.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. The mention of communicating with a C&C server via the HTTPChannel module aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, which is what the InfoOS module is doing by gathering system information such as IOPlatformUUID and operating system version.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial action of gathering system information (T1082) is a common first step for many types of attacks, including those that lead to exfiltration.
   - The question implies a sequence where system information is gathered, and then there's a potential communication with a C&C server. This sequence aligns with preparing for exfiltration activities, where knowing the system details can help in deciding what and how to exfiltrate.
   - The act of sending a "hello" message before receiving commands is a common method for an agent (like XAgent) to establish communication and confirm its presence and readiness to the C&C server. This is a plausible step before receiving commands for exfiltration activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The InfoOS module's action of gathering system information is a precursor to potential exfiltration, fitting the discovery tactic.
   - The XAgent's potential communication with the C&C server via the HTTPChannel module for receiving commands aligns with exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - The sequence described (gathering system info, then communicating with the C&C server) is logical for setting up exfiltration activities.
   - Sending a "hello" message before receiving commands is a standard method for establishing communication and confirming the agent's readiness.

Given the logical sequence of events and the alignment with the provided TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after gathering system information, the XAgent would indeed communicate with its C&C server, and sending a hello message could be a part of establishing this communication.

Final Answer: A
