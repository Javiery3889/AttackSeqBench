To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) using a custom RC4 algorithm for encrypting exploit code to establish a command and control (C2) channel. It asks whether proxy servers are likely to be used within this infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to indirect command and control traffic, making it harder to detect and track the source of the C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption (like the custom RC4 algorithm mentioned) for protecting C2 communications, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the compromised host and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encrypting exploit code indicates an effort to secure the C2 channel, aligning with **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**.
   - The question of whether proxy servers will be used to make infections harder to detect directly relates to **T1090-Proxy**. Given that the attackers are already employing encryption to protect their C2 communications, it's reasonable to assume they would also use proxies to further obscure the origin and destination of these communications, enhancing evasion capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers are using encryption for their C2 operations, indicating a desire to maintain secrecy and evade detection.
   - **Step 2**: The use of proxies (T1090-Proxy) is a common technique to further anonymize C2 traffic, making it more difficult for defenders to identify and block malicious communications.
   - **Step 3**: Combining encryption with proxy usage is a powerful strategy for hiding malicious activity, suggesting that if encryption is being used, proxy servers could also be employed as part of a comprehensive evasion strategy.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of using custom encryption for C2 communications and the relevance of T1090-Proxy for anonymizing such traffic, it is plausible that proxy servers would be used to make infections harder to detect.

Final Answer: A
