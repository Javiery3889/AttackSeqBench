To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. It then asks if it's likely that a COM (Component Object Model) object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** - This is the first stage of an attack where the adversary gains access to the system or network.
   - **Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves sending a targeted email with an attachment that contains malicious code. The attachment is often designed to exploit a vulnerability or execute malicious code when opened.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access vector described in the question (phishing emails with a malicious Word document) aligns with the **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment** technique. This technique is commonly used to deliver malware or establish a foothold in a system.
   - The use of a malicious document (like a Word document) can lead to the execution of malicious code, potentially including the use of COM objects to interact with the system.
   - COM objects can be used to execute queries and gather system information, which is a common step after initial access to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - Ursnif and GandCrab are known malware families. Ursnif is a banking Trojan that can steal sensitive information, and GandCrab is ransomware. Both are capable of being downloaded and executed as part of a post-exploitation phase, following initial access and reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access method (phishing with a malicious attachment) matches the described TTP, making it plausible.
   - **Step 2**: The execution of a COM object to gather system information is a feasible next step after gaining initial access, as it helps in understanding the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 3**: Downloading payloads associated with known malware like Ursnif and GandCrab after gathering system information is consistent with post-exploitation activities aimed at establishing persistence, stealing data, or extorting the victim.
   
Given the logical progression from initial access through spearphishing with a malicious attachment, to using a COM object for system reconnaissance, and finally downloading malware payloads, the scenario described in the question is consistent with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

**Final Answer: A**
