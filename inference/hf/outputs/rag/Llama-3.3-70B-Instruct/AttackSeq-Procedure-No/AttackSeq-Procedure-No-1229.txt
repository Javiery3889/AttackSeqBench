To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group has deployed Hermes ransomware, which uses a 2048-bit RSA algorithm for file encryption and leaves ransom notes. The question then asks if it's likely that the group established command and control (C2) communication using backdoor malware to interact with remote C&C servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This indicates the adversary's goal of encrypting data to disrupt or deny access to it, which aligns with the deployment of ransomware like Hermes.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This suggests the use of symmetric cryptography for C2 communication. However, the question mentions the use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm (which is asymmetric cryptography) for file encryption, not necessarily for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The deployment of ransomware and the encryption of files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm are consistent with the Impact tactic, specifically the Data Encrypted for Impact technique.
   - The use of backdoor malware for establishing C2 communication is a common tactic among threat actors. Although the provided TTPs mention symmetric cryptography for C2, the question's context implies the use of backdoor malware for C2 communication, which is plausible and aligns with common threat actor behaviors.
   - The mention of polling remote C&C servers for tasks and executing commands is a typical behavior associated with backdoor malware, supporting the likelihood of this scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary actions taken by the Lazarus group (deployment of Hermes ransomware, file encryption, and leaving ransom notes).
   - **Step 2**: Understand the tactics and techniques mentioned (Impact through data encryption and Command and Control).
   - **Step 3**: Recognize the plausibility of using backdoor malware for C2 communication, despite the specific cryptographic method mentioned for file encryption.
   - **Step 4**: Conclude based on the analysis that the scenario described is consistent with known threat actor behaviors and tactics.

Final Answer: A
