To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware has infected a computer and has gathered system and user information. It then inquires about the likelihood of the malware extracting emails from archived Outlook .pst files to transmit data to the attackers via encrypted emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.003-Email Account**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about email accounts, which could include account names or addresses. This is part of the discovery phase where attackers gather information about the system or network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email from local email clients, which could include extracting emails from .pst files used by Outlook. This is part of the collection phase where attackers gather data of interest.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario described in the question involves the malware gathering system and user information, which aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, specifically with techniques related to gathering information about the system or its users.
   - The action of extracting emails from archived Outlook .pst files falls under the **Collection** tactic, specifically the technique of local email collection (T1114.001). This action is a direct method of collecting sensitive data that could be of interest to the attackers.
   - Transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers is a method of exfiltration, which is a logical next step after collection but is not directly addressed by the provided TTPs. However, the collection of emails for the purpose of exfiltration is a common tactic used by attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has already performed actions consistent with the Discovery tactic by gathering system and user information.
   - **Step 2**: The next logical step for the malware, given its capabilities and the goals of attackers, would be to collect sensitive data.
   - **Step 3**: Extracting emails from .pst files (T1114.001) is a method of collecting sensitive data that aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - **Step 4**: Given that the malware is capable of gathering and likely exfiltrating data, and considering the provided TTPs, it is plausible that the malware would extract emails for transmission to the attackers.

**Final Answer: A**
