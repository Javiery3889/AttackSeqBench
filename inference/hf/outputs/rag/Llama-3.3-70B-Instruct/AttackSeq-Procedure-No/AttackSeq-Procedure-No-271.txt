To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda's Korplug variant is used for data exfiltration, utilizing a custom protocol over TCP with compressed and encrypted messages. It asks whether, after this action, it is likely for the malware to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This indicates that the adversary is capable of collecting and archiving data using custom methods, which aligns with the use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This suggests that the adversary is interested in discovering files and directories on the compromised system, which could be a precursor to collecting specific data or understanding the layout of the system for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Korplug variant is involved in data exfiltration and uses a custom protocol, it indicates a level of sophistication and intent to collect specific data.
   - The use of custom methods for archiving (T1560.003) implies that the adversary is capable of and interested in collecting data in a way that might not be easily detectable or reversible.
   - The technique of file and directory discovery (T1083) is a common step in the attack sequence for understanding what data is available on the system before exfiltration. It makes logical sense that after establishing a means of exfiltration, the next step would involve identifying what data to exfiltrate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The adversary has established a means of exfiltrating data using a custom protocol, indicating an interest in collecting specific data from the compromised system.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs suggest capabilities in both collecting data via custom methods and discovering files and directories, which are complementary actions in the context of data exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the TTPs, it is logical that after setting up a method for data exfiltration, the adversary would engage in data discovery to identify valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis of the related TTPs, it is likely that after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration, Mustang Panda's Korplug variant would perform data discovery on the system.

Final Answer: A
