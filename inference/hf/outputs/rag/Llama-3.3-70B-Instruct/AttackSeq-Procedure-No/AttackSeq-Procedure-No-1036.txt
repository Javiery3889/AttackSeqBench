To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, likely APT10, has already gained access to a network, specifically mentioning the use of Mimikatz for credential theft, accessing a Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus, and copying the NTDS.DIT database file. The question then asks whether it is likely that APT10 would use remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement instead of using valid user accounts to log in via Citrix servers.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS**: This refers to the technique of accessing or extracting credential material from the NTDS.dit file, which is a part of the Active Directory database. This is directly relevant to the actions described in the question, such as using Mimikatz and copying the NTDS.DIT database file.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access to a network. The question mentions logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts, which aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The actions described (using Mimikatz, accessing the domain controller, deploying Trochilus, and copying NTDS.DIT) indicate that the attackers have already gained significant access to the network and are likely looking to maintain access and move laterally.
   - The use of valid accounts (T1078) for initial access is a common tactic, especially after credential theft, as it allows attackers to blend in with normal network activity.
   - Remote COM execution for delivering Beacon payloads is a method that could be used for lateral movement, allowing the attackers to expand their control within the network without needing to use login credentials for each new system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT10 has already demonstrated the ability to use sophisticated methods for initial access and credential theft.
   - The use of valid accounts for login via Citrix servers, especially with a pattern consistent with Tianjin, China working hours, suggests an attempt to appear as legitimate traffic.
   - However, for lateral movement, using remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads could provide a more stealthy and efficient way to spread through the network compared to relying solely on logging in with valid accounts, which might be more detectable, especially if the accounts are monitored for unusual activity.

**Final Answer: A**
