To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, associated with the Fox Kitten Campaign, has already gained credential access using tools like Procdump and Mimikatz. These tools are used to extract credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory, which aligns with the T1003.001-LSASS Memory technique under the Credential Access tactic. The attacker then uses "Invoke the Hash" for pass-the-hash attacks, which is related to the T1550.002-Pass the Hash technique under the Lateral Movement tactic. The question asks whether, after these actions, the attacker is likely to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker (a type of ransomware) and other tools across the network for lateral movement.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This involves obtaining credentials from the LSASS memory, which is what tools like Mimikatz are used for.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This involves using a password hash to authenticate to a remote system, which is what "Invoke the Hash" is used for.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique is also listed under Defense Evasion, indicating that pass-the-hash can be used to evade detection by not requiring cleartext passwords.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: Given that the attacker has already used techniques for credential access and lateral movement, and considering the goal of moving AvosLocker and tools across the network, the question is whether using PDQ Deploy for this purpose aligns with known TTPs. PDQ Deploy is a tool that can be used for deploying software across a network, which could potentially be used for lateral movement by deploying malicious tools or ransomware like AvosLocker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Fox Kitten Campaign has already demonstrated the use of sophisticated TTPs for credential access and lateral movement.
   - The use of PDQ Deploy to move malicious tools across the network would be a plausible next step for lateral movement, especially considering the goal of deploying ransomware.
   - The provided TTPs focus on credential access and lateral movement, which aligns with the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
