To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an actor uses obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory. It then asks if it's likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from its command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information." This indicates that the actor is using techniques to evade defenses by deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - The use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads suggests a sophisticated attack that aims to evade detection.
    - Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory could be a step to establish a foothold in the system.
    - Retrieving encrypted commands from a C2 server for follow-on actions like cryptocurrency mining would be a logical next step after establishing a foothold, as it allows the actor to maintain control over the compromised system and execute further malicious activities without being detected.
    - The technique T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) supports the initial steps of the attack sequence described, implying that the actor is capable of complex, multi-step operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The actor has already demonstrated the ability to evade defenses and establish a foothold in the system.
    - The use of encryption for C2 communications is a common tactic to maintain stealth and control.
    - Cryptocurrency mining is a plausible follow-on action as it can generate revenue for the actor without requiring significant additional interaction with the compromised system.
    - Given the sophistication of the initial attack and the common goals of such attacks, it is reasonable to conclude that the actor would proceed with retrieving encrypted commands for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
