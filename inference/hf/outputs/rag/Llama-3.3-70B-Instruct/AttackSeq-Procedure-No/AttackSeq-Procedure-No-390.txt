To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors use AtomBombing, a technique that allows malicious code injection into legitimate processes, leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms. It then asks if it's likely that these actors would use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script, such as embedding it in a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection. AtomBombing falls under this category as it exploits Windows mechanisms for code injection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts for execution. VBA scripts, which are used in Microsoft Office applications like Word, can be considered under this broader category as they are based on VB and can be used to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of AtomBombing indicates the threat actors are interested in evading defenses by leveraging legitimate system mechanisms for malicious purposes.
   - The mention of VBA scripts, particularly in the context of embedding them within malicious documents (like Word documents), aligns with the tactic of using legitimate applications (in this case, Microsoft Office) to execute malicious code. This is a common method for initial access or execution, where the malicious document is opened by the victim, triggering the VBA script to run.
   - Both techniques (AtomBombing and using VBA scripts) are about executing malicious code in a way that might not be immediately detected by security software, fitting into the broader strategies of defense evasion and execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial technique used by the threat actors (AtomBombing for code injection).
   - **Step 2**: Understand the goal of using such a technique (defense evasion through legitimate process exploitation).
   - **Step 3**: Analyze the related TTPs to see if they support the use of VBA scripts as a plausible next step (T1059.005-Visual Basic supports the use of VB scripts for execution, which includes VBA scripts in Office documents).
   - **Step 4**: Determine if the use of VBA scripts in malicious documents aligns with the tactics and techniques already employed by the threat actors (it does, as both involve executing malicious code in a stealthy manner).
   
Given the information and the logical flow from one technique to the next, it's reasonable to conclude that threat actors who use AtomBombing might also use VBA scripts embedded in malicious documents as part of their strategy, as both methods are aimed at executing malicious code in a way that evades detection.

Final Answer: A
