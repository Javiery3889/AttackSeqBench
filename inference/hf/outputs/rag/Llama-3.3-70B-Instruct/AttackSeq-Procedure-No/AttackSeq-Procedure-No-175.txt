To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Whitefly, has already compromised additional machines using stolen credentials for lateral movement. It then asks if it's likely that Whitefly would use publicly available tools and exploit vulnerabilities for network service discovery only after using tools to steal large volumes of sensitive information.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This indicates that the attacker is moving laterally within the network by exploiting remote services, which is a common technique after initial access to expand control and access within the network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves the attacker trying to discover services running on the network, which could be for the purpose of identifying potential vulnerabilities to exploit for further movement or to understand the network layout.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: lateral movement, then possibly network service discovery after stealing sensitive information. 
   - Typically, an attacker would first want to understand the network layout and discover services (T1046) to identify potential targets for exploitation (T1210) and to know where sensitive information might be located.
   - Stealing large volumes of sensitive information usually comes after the attacker has a good understanding of the network and has identified where valuable data resides, which might involve network service discovery as a precursor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker compromises additional machines for lateral movement.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively steal large volumes of sensitive information, the attacker would likely need to perform network service discovery (T1046) to understand the network and identify potential sources of sensitive data.
   - **Step 3**: After identifying where the sensitive data is located through network service discovery, the attacker could then use this information to steal the data.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the typical flow of a cyber attack (reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, data collection), it seems less likely that an attacker would steal sensitive information before performing network service discovery, as discovery is often a necessary step to identify where and how to access that information.

**Final Answer: B**
