To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after developing their custom toolset and registering domains, it is likely that ProjectM actors identified network topologies before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. This implies a sequence of actions where the actors prepare (develop tools and register domains), potentially recon (identify network topologies), and then execute an attack to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This involves compromising a website or a server to infect the website's visitors with malware, which can be used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: Registering domains is part of resource development, which can be used for various purposes, including command and control (C2) communication, phishing sites, or other malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves sending phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access to a system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions developing a custom toolset and registering domains, which aligns with **T1583.001-Domains** under Resource Development. This preparation phase suggests that the actors are setting up resources that could be used for various tactics, including initial access.
   - The question then asks about identifying network topologies before gaining initial access. Identifying network topologies is typically part of the reconnaissance phase, which is not directly listed in the provided TTPs but is a common step before attempting to gain access.
   - The provided TTPs for initial access include **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** and **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**, indicating methods the actors might use to gain initial access after preparation and potential reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The actors prepare by developing their custom toolset and registering domains, which is a common precursor to more targeted actions.
   - **Step 2**: While not explicitly listed, identifying network topologies (reconnaissance) would logically precede attempts to gain initial access, as it helps in targeting the efforts more effectively.
   - **Step 3**: The actors then use methods like spear-phishing emails and potentially watering hole attacks (related to drive-by compromise) to gain initial access.
   
Given the context and the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is reasonable to assume that after preparing their resources (developing custom toolsets and registering domains), the actors would likely engage in some form of reconnaissance (such as identifying network topologies) before attempting to gain initial access through targeted means like spear-phishing.

**Final Answer: A**
