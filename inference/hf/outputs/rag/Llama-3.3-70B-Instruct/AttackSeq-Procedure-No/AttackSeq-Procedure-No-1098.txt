To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of actions attributed to CosmicDuke, a type of malware. These actions include searching removable drives, skipping certain file types during collection, and the potential use of a custom LZW algorithm for compressing output data before exfiltrating it via FTP. The question essentially asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a custom LZW compression method for the collected data before sending it to remote servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Collection tactic. Specifically, they mention archiving via library (T1560.002) and archiving via custom method (T1560.003). These techniques suggest that the malware has the capability to collect and archive data, potentially using both standard library functions and custom methods for compression or archiving.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - **T1560.002-Archive via Library** implies the use of existing, possibly standard, library functions for archiving. This could include common compression algorithms and methods.
    - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** suggests the malware can use non-standard, custom methods for archiving, which could include a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compression.
    - Given that CosmicDuke is described as using a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compressing output data, this aligns with the capability to use custom archiving methods (T1560.003).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question specifies a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm, which is a method of compression.
    - The related TTPs indicate that the malware can use custom methods for archiving, which would include compression.
    - The use of a custom LZW algorithm for compression before exfiltration via FTP fits within the capabilities described by the related TTPs, especially T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method.
    - Therefore, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would compress output data with a custom LZW algorithm before exfiltrating it.

Final Answer: A
