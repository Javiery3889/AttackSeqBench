To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after gathering system information from infected machines, is considering creating proxies between infected hosts. This action is followed by downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code. The question is asking whether this sequence of actions is likely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This indicates the use of internal proxies to facilitate command and control (C2) communications, potentially allowing the attacker to route traffic through compromised hosts.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network, which aligns with the initial action of gathering system information (IP Address, Volume Serial Number, Computer Name).
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This involves executing JavaScript code, which could be part of the attacker's plan to further compromise the system or maintain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of gathering system information (T1016) is a common first step in understanding the environment.
   - Creating SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies (T1090.001) would be a logical next step for an attacker looking to establish a command and control channel that can bypass traditional network defenses, especially after they have a good understanding of the system and network.
   - Downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code (T1059.007 and potentially other execution techniques for VBScript) could be part of the attacker's strategy to execute malicious code on the compromised hosts, potentially leveraging the proxies for C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gathers system information, which is a common initial step in a cyber attack for reconnaissance.
   - **Step 2**: The creation of proxies between infected hosts would facilitate command and control, allowing the attacker to issue commands and receive data without being easily detected.
   - **Step 3**: Executing scripts like JScript and VBScript can be used for various malicious purposes, including further exploitation, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network.
   - Given the logical progression from reconnaissance, to establishing a covert communication channel, to executing malicious code, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns.
