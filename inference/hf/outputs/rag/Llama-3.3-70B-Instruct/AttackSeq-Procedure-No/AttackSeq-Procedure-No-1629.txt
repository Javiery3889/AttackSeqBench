To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary has gained access to a victim's network through compromised remote services (like VPN or Citrix). It then asks if it's likely that the adversary will use scheduled tasks to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory after achieving persistence, specifically targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that scheduled tasks can be used for persistence, which aligns with the idea of maintaining access over time.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This shows that external remote services can be used for persistence, which is relevant to the initial access method described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This suggests that scheduled tasks can also be used for executing malicious code, which could include executing a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where an adversary has already gained initial access (through compromised remote services) and is looking to maintain persistence and possibly execute further malicious code.
   - The use of scheduled tasks (T1053.005) for both persistence and execution provides a plausible method for an adversary to maintain access and execute tools like a Cobalt Strike beacon, especially on systems with high uptimes like servers, where tasks can be scheduled to run at specific intervals without arousing suspicion.
   - Targeting systems with high uptimes increases the likelihood of the scheduled task executing as intended, as these systems are less likely to be restarted or taken offline, which could interrupt the adversary's access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary has gained initial access through compromised remote services.
   - The goal is to achieve persistence and execute a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.
   - Scheduled tasks can be used for both persistence and execution, making them a suitable choice for these goals.
   - Targeting systems with high uptimes like servers increases the effectiveness of using scheduled tasks for these purposes.
   
Given the information and analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that after obtaining access, an adversary would likely use scheduled tasks to execute a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory as part of achieving persistence, especially on systems that are always on, like servers.

Final Answer: A
