To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Sednit group has successfully compromised a victim's machine using a spear-phishing email with a Flash exploit. It then asks if it's likely that the group will use making and impersonating tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This is the method used by the Sednit group to initially gain access to the victim's machine, which aligns with the spear-phishing email described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**: This technique involves creating and impersonating tokens to escalate privileges, which could be a step after initial access to maintain persistence and deeper access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**: Similar to the above, this involves stealing or impersonating tokens for privilege escalation, which is another method that could be used after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Sednit group has already gained initial access via phishing (T1566), the next logical steps for maintaining access and deepening their foothold in the system would involve privilege escalation techniques.
   - Making and impersonating tokens (T1134.003) is a specific technique under the broader category of privilege escalation that could be used to achieve persistence and higher levels of access on the victim's machine.
   - The fact that both T1134.003 and T1134.001 are listed under the same tactic (Privilege Escalation) and are related to token manipulation suggests that these techniques could be part of the group's post-exploitation activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Sednit group has successfully gained initial access.
   - The next step for any attacker after gaining access would typically involve escalating privileges to maintain persistence and achieve their objectives.
   - Given the techniques listed (T1134.003 and T1134.001), it is reasonable to conclude that making and impersonating tokens could be a part of their strategy for privilege escalation.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the group would use such techniques to further their goals after initial access.

Final Answer: A
