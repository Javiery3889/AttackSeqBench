To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a campaign that starts with phishing emails containing a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The goal is to determine if it's likely that the campaign will exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access.

2. **Understanding the Vulnerability**: CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, which is the operating system used by Fortinet's FortiGate firewalls. This vulnerability allows for path traversal, enabling an attacker to download system files via HTTP. It's a significant vulnerability because it can be exploited to gain access to sensitive information or to further compromise a network.

3. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access. Exploiting CVE-2018-13379 falls under this category because it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application (the FortiOS device) to gain access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access. The malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file attached to phishing emails is an example of this technique.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial access vector described in the question is through phishing emails with a malicious attachment (T1566.001), which aligns with one of the provided TTPs.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of exploiting CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access. Given that the initial access is achieved through phishing, which is a common precursor to various types of attacks, and considering that exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) is a known tactic for initial access, it's plausible that an attacker could use the initial access gained from phishing as a stepping stone for further exploitation, including exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379 in devices that are accessible from the initially compromised system.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Initial access is gained through phishing emails with a malicious attachment.
   - The attackers then have the potential to move laterally within the network or exploit other vulnerabilities that are accessible from the compromised system.
   - Given the presence of FortiOS devices with the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability, it's reasonable to assume that attackers could attempt to exploit this vulnerability as part of their campaign, especially if the vulnerability is not patched and the devices are accessible.

**Final Answer: A**
