To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the NewsBeef group uses spearphishing and watering hole attacks with malicious macro-enabled Office documents to gain initial access. It then asks if it's likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver specific malware (JHUHUGIT and Koadic) during the execution phase of the campaign.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the execution tactic. Specifically:
   - **T1204.002: Malicious File** refers to the use of malicious files, which can include Office documents with macros, to execute malicious code.
   - **T1559.002: Dynamic Data Exchange** refers to the use of DDE, a protocol that allows data to be exchanged between applications, for executing malicious commands, potentially including PowerShell commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access vector involves malicious macro-enabled Office documents, which aligns with **T1204.002**.
   - The question then asks about the execution of PowerShell commands through DDE, which directly relates to **T1559.002**.
   - Given that the initial access method involves malicious Office documents and considering the techniques mentioned (malicious files and DDE), it's plausible that the attackers would leverage these techniques for executing PowerShell commands to deliver additional malware like JHUHUGIT and Koadic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The NewsBeef group uses spearphishing and watering hole attacks with malicious macro-enabled Office documents for initial access, which is a known TTP.
   - **Step 2**: The use of malicious Office documents (T1204.002) for initial access suggests that the attackers are comfortable using Office applications as a vector for malicious activity.
   - **Step 3**: The execution phase involves delivering additional malware (JHUHUGIT and Koadic), and using DDE (T1559.002) to execute PowerShell commands is a known method for executing malicious code within Office applications.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the initial access method and the TTPs involved, it is likely that the attackers would use Word documents to execute PowerShell commands through DDE as part of the execution phase to deliver the mentioned malware.

Final Answer: A
