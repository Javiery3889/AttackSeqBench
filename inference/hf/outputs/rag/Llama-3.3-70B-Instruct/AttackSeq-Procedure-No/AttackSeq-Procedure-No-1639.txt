To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an adversary using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement to identify target systems and data of interest. It then asks if it's likely that the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This indicates the use of cloud storage services to exfiltrate data from a target network. It's a method used by adversaries to transfer stolen data outside the victim's network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This involves automatically collecting data from a target system or network, which can include using tools to gather file and directory listings, especially from network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where an adversary has already used lateral movement capabilities to identify targets and is now considering the exfiltration of data.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the adversary is capable of exfiltrating data to cloud storage and has an interest in collecting data automatically.
   - The sequence of actions typically involves collecting or gathering data of interest (which would include copying results of the discovery phase like file and directory lists) before exfiltrating it. Exfiltration to cloud storage is a method that could be used after the data of interest has been identified and collected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary has used Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and identification of target systems and data.
   - The next logical step would be to collect or gather the identified data of interest, which aligns with the Collection tactic and the Automated Collection technique (T1119).
   - After collecting the data (e.g., file and directory lists from network shared drives), the adversary would then exfiltrate this data, potentially using cloud storage web services as described in the Exfiltration tactic and the Exfiltration to Cloud Storage technique (T1567.002).
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the adversary would exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying the results of the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B**
