To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that SideCopy, presumably a threat actor or malware, would target access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT (a remote access trojan) for Credential Access, but only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This suggests gathering information about credentials, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This involves obtaining credentials from files, which could be part of the credential access phase to gain unauthorized access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a specific sequence of actions: using GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, followed by targeting access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT.
   - The related TTPs provide context on exfiltration, reconnaissance focused on credentials, and accessing credentials from files.
   - The use of specific tools (GoLang-based plugins, njRAT) and targeting specific data (Kavach authentication databases, Indian government employee credentials) suggests a tailored approach by the threat actor.
   - The sequence described involves both exfiltration and credential access tactics, which aligns with the TTPs provided, especially considering the focus on automated exfiltration and accessing credentials from files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary actions described - exfiltration of specific databases and credential access targeting government employees.
   - **Step 2**: Match these actions with the provided TTPs, noting the relevance of automated exfiltration and credential access techniques.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the specificity of the tools and targets mentioned, which suggests a deliberate and targeted campaign.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood based on the alignment with known TTPs and the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack.
   - Given the information and the context provided by the related TTPs, it seems plausible that a threat actor like SideCopy could engage in such targeted activities, especially considering the use of specific malware (njRAT) and the focus on Indian government credentials, which could be of significant interest to certain threat actors.

Final Answer: A
