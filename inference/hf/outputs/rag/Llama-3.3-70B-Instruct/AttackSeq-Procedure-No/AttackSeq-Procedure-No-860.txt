To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor program has already gathered host information during the discovery phase. It then inquires about the likelihood of the backdoor using DNS for Command and Control (C2) communication instead of using DNS tunneling for communication and then parsing the returned data to extract commands.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTP provided is T1071.004, which refers to the technique of using DNS for C2 communication. This technique involves using the DNS protocol to communicate with a C2 server, which can include both sending and receiving data. DNS tunneling is a specific method under this technique where data is encapsulated within DNS queries and responses to bypass network restrictions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after gathering host information, the backdoor is likely to use DNS for C2 communication. Given that T1071.004 includes using DNS for C2, this is a plausible next step. The use of DNS for C2 can involve direct communication or could encompass methods like DNS tunneling for more covert operations.
    - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that the backdoor would not use DNS for C2 communication after the discovery phase, which contradicts the common practices associated with T1071.004, especially considering that DNS tunneling is a subset of using DNS for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The backdoor program has completed the discovery phase, indicating it has host information.
    - The next logical step for a backdoor would be to establish C2 communication to receive further instructions.
    - T1071.004 (DNS) is a technique used for C2 communication, which can include DNS tunneling as a method to bypass security controls.
    - Given the context, using DNS for C2 (which could involve DNS tunneling) aligns with the provided TTP and is a common approach for backdoors to communicate with C2 servers without being detected.

**Final Answer: A**
