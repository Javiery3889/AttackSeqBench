To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, FamousSparrow, has used a custom version of Mimikatz for credential access. It then asks whether the attacker is likely to read file contents and exfiltrate them before collecting system information during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This indicates the attacker is interested in collecting data from the local system, which could include reading file contents.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This is related to the use of Mimikatz to access credentials by dumping the LSASS memory, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests the attacker has the capability and intention to exfiltrate data back to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if the attacker would prioritize exfiltrating data (like files) over collecting system information after gaining access to credentials.
   - Given the tactics and techniques listed, the attacker has demonstrated an interest in both collecting data (T1005) and exfiltrating it (T1041).
   - Collecting system information (like usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types) is typically part of the Discovery phase, aimed at understanding the environment.
   - Exfiltrating data, especially after accessing credentials, could be a high-priority action to capitalize on the access gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has used Mimikatz for credential access, indicating a focus on gaining access to sensitive information.
   - The capability to exfiltrate data over a C2 channel (T1041) suggests that once valuable data is accessed, it would be a priority to remove it from the compromised system.
   - Reading file contents and exfiltrating them could be seen as a natural next step after gaining credential access, especially if the files contain sensitive information.
   - However, the question of whether this happens before collecting system information during the Discovery phase depends on the attacker's immediate goals and the value they place on the potentially exfiltrated data versus the need for system information.

Given the context and the tactics/techniques provided, it seems plausible that an attacker, after gaining access to credentials, would prioritize exfiltrating valuable data before or concurrently with collecting system information, as both actions serve different purposes in the attack lifecycle. However, the specific sequence can depend on the attacker's objectives and the perceived value of the data versus the system information at that moment.

**Final Answer: A**
