To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 (Command and Control) server, POWERSHOWER is likely to use external proxy techniques as part of maintaining Command and Control. This involves understanding the context of Command and Control in the realm of cyber attacks, where maintaining a covert and resilient connection between the compromised system and the C2 server is crucial.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Command and Control. Specifically, they mention:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is about maintaining a connection between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server to issue commands.
   - **Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This involves using external proxies, such as compromising residential endpoints, to relay command traffic. This technique helps in masking the true source of the command and control traffic, making it harder to detect and block.
   - **Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This is a broader technique that involves using a proxy to relay traffic between the compromised system and the C2 server, which can include external proxies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that POWERSHOWER has already established communication with the C2 server by sending system information, the next logical step in maintaining Command and Control would be to ensure this communication remains undetected and resilient. Using external proxy techniques (T1090.002) is a common method to achieve this, as it allows the attacker to hide the actual IP address of the C2 server and makes it more difficult for defenders to track and block the communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of Command and Control in cyber attacks and the importance of maintaining a covert connection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the role of external proxy techniques in enhancing the stealth and resilience of C2 communications.
   - **Step 3**: Relate the provided TTPs to the scenario described, noting that using external proxies aligns with the goals of Command and Control.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the importance of maintaining a stealthy and resilient Command and Control channel, and considering the provided TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that POWERSHOWER would likely use external proxy techniques as part of its operations.

Final Answer: A
