To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing command and control, Elfin likely exfiltrated data over Google Drive. This implies we are looking at the plausibility of using cloud storage services for data exfiltration after gaining control of a system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system, which could be done through various means, including but not limited to cloud services.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. Google Drive is a cloud storage service, making this technique directly relevant to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Elfin has established command and control and is looking to exfiltrate data, the use of cloud storage services like Google Drive (as indicated by T1567.002) is a plausible method for exfiltration. This is because cloud storage services can be used to transfer files without being as overtly suspicious as other methods, and they provide an easy way to access the exfiltrated data from anywhere.
   - The fact that T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) is also mentioned suggests that the exfiltration process could be automated, which aligns with the capabilities of tools like Quasar RAT. However, the specific mention of exfiltration to cloud storage (T1567.002) directly supports the idea of using services like Google Drive for this purpose.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of the question, which involves command and control establishment followed by data exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the relevance of the provided TTPs, especially T1567.002, which directly pertains to exfiltrating data to cloud storage services.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the capabilities of the tools mentioned (POSHC2, Quasar RAT) and how they could facilitate automated exfiltration processes.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the specific mention of exfiltration to cloud storage as a technique and the context provided, it is plausible that Elfin would use Google Drive for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
