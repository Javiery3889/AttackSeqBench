To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has accessed Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts. It then asks if the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email from local email clients. Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI falls under this category as it involves collecting email accounts or content locally from the victim's system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up rules on the victim's email account to forward emails to an account controlled by the attacker. While this does involve the collection of emails, it specifies the method of email forwarding rather than exfiltration over FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI for collecting email accounts, which aligns with **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**.
   - The question then asks about the automatic exfiltration of the collected email accounts over FTP. Neither of the provided TTPs directly mentions exfiltration over FTP. **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule** mentions forwarding emails, which is a form of exfiltration but does not specify the use of FTP.
   - Exfiltration over FTP would typically be categorized under a different technique, such as **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** or more specifically techniques related to data transfer, not directly under the collection tactics mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The provided TTPs focus on the collection of email data, not the exfiltration method.
   - Exfiltration over FTP is not directly implied by the techniques **T1114.001** or **T1114.003**.
   - Therefore, based on the information given and the related TTPs, the collected email accounts are not automatically implied to be exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers as part of the described techniques.

Final Answer: B
