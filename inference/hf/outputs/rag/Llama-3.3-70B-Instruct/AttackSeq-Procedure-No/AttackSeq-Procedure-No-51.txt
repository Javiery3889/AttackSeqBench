To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group, after establishing network connections for lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC, is considering exfiltrating collected data. The method of exfiltration in question involves using a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool, followed by archiving the data using utilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates that the adversary is likely to exfiltrate data over a command and control (C2) channel, which can include custom or covert channels for data transfer.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**: This shows the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for execution, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question (using WMIC for lateral movement).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of a custom tunneling tool for creating a covert channel, which aligns with the concept of exfiltrating data over a C2 channel (T1041). This technique is a common method for adversaries to secretly transfer data out of a compromised network.
   - The use of WMIC for initial lateral movement (related to T1047) sets a context where the adversary is comfortable using Windows-specific tools and techniques for their operations. This comfort could extend to using custom tools for further actions like data exfiltration.
   - Archiving data using utilities before or after exfiltration could be part of the adversary's process to organize and possibly compress data for easier transfer, which is a plausible step in the exfiltration process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Lazarus group has used Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, indicating a familiarity with Windows-based tools and techniques.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs suggest a propensity for exfiltrating data over C2 channels and utilizing Windows Management Instrumentation, which aligns with the initial actions described.
   - **Step 3**: Creating a covert channel with a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration, followed by archiving, is a sophisticated yet plausible approach for an adversary like the Lazarus group, given their demonstrated capabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the described actions and related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the Lazarus group would indeed exfiltrate collected data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it using utilities.

Final Answer: A
