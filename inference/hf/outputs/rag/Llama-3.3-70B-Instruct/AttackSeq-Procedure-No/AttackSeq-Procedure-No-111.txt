To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement only after they have gained knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase, following the installation of additional persistence points on new systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of Lateral Movement and the technique of T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services. Lateral movement refers to the actions an adversary takes to move through a network after gaining initial access, while exploitation of remote services involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to additional systems or data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Understanding the Discovery Phase**: The discovery phase in an attack typically involves gathering information about the target environment, including systems, users, and data. This phase is crucial for planning subsequent actions, such as lateral movement.
    - **Lateral Movement and Exploitation of Remote Services**: Lateral movement is a tactic that can be achieved through various techniques, including the exploitation of remote services. This technique is effective for moving laterally within a network, especially after the adversary has gained sufficient knowledge about the target environment.
    - **Sequence of Actions**: The question implies a sequence where attackers first install additional persistence points (ensuring they can maintain access) and then proceed with lateral movement using the exploitation of remote services. This sequence suggests that the attackers are methodically progressing through the attack lifecycle, using the discovery phase to inform their lateral movement strategy.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The discovery phase is critical for understanding the environment, which in turn informs how lateral movement can be most effectively achieved.
    - Exploiting remote services for lateral movement is a technique that benefits from prior knowledge of the network and its vulnerabilities, which would be gathered during the discovery phase.
    - Therefore, it is logical that attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement after gaining the necessary knowledge, as this approach maximizes the chances of successful movement without detection.
    - Given this reasoning, the answer to whether it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
