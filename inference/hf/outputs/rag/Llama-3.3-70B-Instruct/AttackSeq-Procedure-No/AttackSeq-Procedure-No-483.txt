To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor, which is a piece of malware, and communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel. The question asks if it's likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This TTP involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access to a network. This technique is commonly used by attackers to breach the perimeter of an organization's network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This TTP involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands on a compromised system. The use of cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor falls under this category, indicating that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is using the command shell for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that SparrowDoor is being executed via cmd.exe and the attacker is communicating with a C&C server, it indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system. The question is whether this access was likely gained through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - The fact that SparrowDoor is being executed suggests that the initial access has already been achieved. The use of T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) as a related TTP implies that exploiting public-facing applications could be a method used for initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the scenario - SparrowDoor is executed via cmd.exe, and there's communication with a C&C server.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the execution of SparrowDoor and communication with the C&C server indicate that initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the related TTPs, especially T1190, which is about exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.
   - **Step 4**: Since the question asks about the likelihood of exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities for initial access, and given that T1190 is a common method for initial access, it's reasonable to infer that such an exploit could have been used to gain initial access.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the related TTPs, it's plausible that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for initial access.

Final Answer: A
