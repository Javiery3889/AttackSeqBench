To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by threat actors. Initially, they use T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses. Following this, it's questioned whether they would use T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls: This is a defense evasion technique where attackers manipulate trust mechanisms to make their actions appear legitimate.
   - T1071 Application Layer Protocol: This involves using application layer protocols for command and control, allowing attackers to communicate with compromised systems.
   - T1071.004-DNS: A sub-technique of T1071, specifically using DNS as the application layer protocol for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action is to subvert trust controls (T1553), which is a defense evasion technique. This would logically be followed by establishing command and control (C2) communications, for which T1071 Application Layer Protocol is used. This allows the attackers to issue commands to the compromised systems.
   - T1057 Process Discovery is about gathering information on running processes on a system, which can be crucial for understanding the system's layout, identifying potential targets, or finding processes to hide behind or exploit.
   - The question posits that T1057 Process Discovery happens after establishing C2 using T1071. This sequence makes sense because, after gaining a foothold and establishing a means of command and control, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the system and network to plan further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Threat actors subvert trust controls to evade defenses, making their initial intrusion less detectable.
   - **Step 2**: They establish command and control using application layer protocols, which could involve using compromised infrastructure to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - **Step 3**: After establishing a reliable means of issuing commands, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the system and its processes to facilitate further exploitation or to maintain stealth.
   - Given this sequence, it is plausible that after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control (using T1071), the threat actors would employ T1057 Process Discovery to gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks.

**Final Answer: A**
