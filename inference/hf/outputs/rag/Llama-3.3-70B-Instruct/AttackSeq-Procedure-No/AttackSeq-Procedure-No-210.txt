To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, the Milestone backdoor is considered for its potential actions. Specifically, it asks if it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041). This indicates that the context of the question involves the methods attackers use to extract data from a compromised system, specifically using the channel established for command and control as a means to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities** suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is gathering information. This is a common precursor to exfiltration, as understanding the system and its data is crucial for determining what to exfiltrate.
    - **Communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port** is a tactic used by attackers to evade detection, as many security systems monitor standard ports more closely than non-standard ones. Using a non-standard port does not inherently prevent exfiltration but is a method to potentially avoid detection.
    - **Exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel (T1041)** directly aligns with one of the provided related TTPs, indicating that using the established C2 channel for data exfiltration is a known and documented technique used by attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question outlines a scenario that starts with system compromise and information gathering.
    - The use of a non-standard port for C2 communication is plausible as a method to avoid detection.
    - The exfiltration of data over the established C2 channel is a known technique (T1041) that aligns with the provided TTPs.
    - Given the context and the TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, the Milestone backdoor could indeed communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel, as this aligns with known tactics and techniques used by attackers.

Final Answer: A
