To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained initial access to a system by exploiting exposed Docker API ports. The attackers' ultimate goal is to hijack resources, presumably through the deployment of malicious container images. Before achieving this goal, the question asks whether attackers would delete shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.

2. **Understanding the Context of Shadow Volumes**: Shadow volumes, managed by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), are backup copies of the state of a volume at a particular point in time. They can be used for system recovery and backups. Deleting these shadow volumes would inhibit system recovery, making it difficult for defenders to restore the system to a previous, uninfected state.

3. **Analyzing Related TTPs**: The related TTP provided is Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery. This technique involves the attacker taking actions to prevent the system from being restored to a previous state, typically to maintain access or to make recovery more difficult for the defenders.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: If attackers delete shadow volumes, they would be inhibiting system recovery, which aligns with the T1490 technique. This action would support their objective of maintaining access and control over the compromised system, making it harder for defenders to recover and potentially remove the malicious presence.
   - **B: No**: Choosing not to delete shadow volumes would not align with the tactic of inhibiting system recovery. It would leave open the possibility for defenders to restore the system from a shadow volume, potentially removing the attackers' access and control.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Attackers have gained initial access and aim to hijack resources.
   - Their goal is to maintain control and access, which aligns with inhibiting system recovery.
   - Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe` would achieve this by preventing easy system restoration.
   - The related TTP (T1490) supports the action of inhibiting system recovery as part of the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: A**
