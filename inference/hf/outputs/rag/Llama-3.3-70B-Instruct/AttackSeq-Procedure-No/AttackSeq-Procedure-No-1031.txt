To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained access to a network and are using various tools and techniques (like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh) for lateral movement. It then asks if, after achieving this movement, it's likely that attackers would use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather more information about the Active Directory and network as part of the discovery process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves the discovery of remote systems on a network. Tools like ADFind (for Active Directory information) and port scanning (to identify open ports and services on remote systems) fit within this category as they help in understanding the network layout and identifying potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This involves obtaining or creating tools that can be used for various purposes during an attack, including discovery and exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the attackers have already achieved lateral movement within the network, the next logical step would be to gather as much information as possible about the network and its components. This includes identifying remote systems (T1018), understanding the Active Directory structure (which ADFind can help with), and using port scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities or open services that could be exploited. These actions align with the discovery tactic and are essential for planning further attacks or for maintaining access within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Attackers have used specific tools and techniques for lateral movement, indicating they are already within the network and looking to expand their control or gather more information.
   - **Step 2**: The use of tools like ADFind for Active Directory information and port scanning for network reconnaissance fits the discovery tactic, which is a common next step after gaining initial access and achieving lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: The related TTPs support the idea that after lateral movement, attackers would engage in discovery activities to understand the network better and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is logical that after achieving lateral movement, attackers would indeed use tools like ADFind and port scanning as part of the discovery process to gather more information about the network and its systems.

Final Answer: A
