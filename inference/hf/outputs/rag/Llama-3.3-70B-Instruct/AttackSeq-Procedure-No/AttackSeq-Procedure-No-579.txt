To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained initial access to a system. They used a script from a domain mapped by the sslip.io service and leveraged BADHATCH for command execution. The question asks if it's likely that the attackers will then conduct domain trust discovery before performing system owner/user discovery.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This is about the attackers trying to gather information about the system and network they have compromised.
   - **Technique: T1482 - Domain Trust Discovery**: This involves using tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe to discover the trust relationships between domains in an Active Directory environment. Understanding domain trusts can help attackers plan lateral movement and identify potential targets.
   - **Technique: T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery**: This involves using commands like whoami.exe to identify the owners or users of a system. This information can be used to understand the system's purpose, potential vulnerabilities, and to plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The attackers have already gained access and are in the process of gathering information about the system and network.
   - Domain trust discovery (T1482) provides a broader view of the network structure and potential targets, which can be crucial for planning the next steps, including lateral movement and escalation of privileges.
   - System owner/user discovery (T1033) gives specific information about the current system but is more focused on the local system rather than the overall network structure.

Given the context, it makes sense for attackers to first understand the broader network structure (domain trust discovery) before focusing on specific system details (system owner/user discovery). This sequence allows them to prioritize targets and plan their approach more effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have gained initial access and are likely to start gathering information about the network.
   - Domain trust discovery helps in understanding the network structure and potential targets.
   - System owner/user discovery provides specific details about the system they are currently on.
   - It is logical to first understand the broader network (domain trust) before focusing on specific system details (system owner/user).
