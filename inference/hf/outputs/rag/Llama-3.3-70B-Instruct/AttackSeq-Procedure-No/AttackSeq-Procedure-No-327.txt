To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by iOS malware during the Command and Control phase, including sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files. It then asks if, after these actions, the app is likely to collect specific types of information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) on the victim's device during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Collection and Discovery tactics. 
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** is a technique under the Collection tactic, which involves collecting data from the local system that the adversary is operating on. This could include text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** and **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** are techniques under the Discovery tactic. These involve gathering information about the system (like hardware, software, and configuration) and exploring the file system, respectively.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: The question mentions actions that are typical of the Command and Control phase, which often precede or occur concurrently with the Discovery phase in an attack lifecycle. The Discovery phase is about gathering information to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities. Given that the malware has already established communication and is uploading files, it's plausible that it would proceed to gather more specific information about the device and its data during the Discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has established a connection and is communicating with its command and control server.
   - It has the capability to upload files, which suggests it can transfer data back to the attackers.
   - The Discovery phase is a natural next step for an attacker to gather more information about the compromised device.
   - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data aligns with the Collection tactic, specifically with techniques like T1005-Data from Local System.
   - The mentioned TTPs (T1082 and T1083) under the Discovery tactic support the idea that the malware would engage in information gathering activities.

**Final Answer: A**
