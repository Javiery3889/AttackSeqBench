To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an app uses the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) operations, specifically uploading files. It then asks if, after performing certain routines on an iOS device, the app is likely to send gathered information via HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control purposes. It suggests that attackers might use common internet protocols to communicate with compromised systems, making their traffic blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This refers to the act of transferring data from a compromised system using non-C2 (Command and Control) protocols that are not encrypted. FTP is an example of such a protocol, as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of FTP for uploading files as part of C2 operations. Given that FTP is an unencrypted protocol, this aligns with T1048.003.
   - The question then asks about sending gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. Since HTTP is a web protocol (T1071.001), and considering that attackers often use existing protocols for C2 and exfiltration to blend in, it's plausible that HTTP could be used for sending gathered information, especially if the routines on the iOS device are part of the C2 operations or if the information is being exfiltrated.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of FTP for uploading files indicates that the attackers are using unencrypted, non-C2 protocols for exfiltration or C2, which aligns with T1048.003.
   - The subsequent use of HTTP for sending gathered information could be part of the C2 operations or exfiltration tactics, utilizing web protocols as described in T1071.001.
   - Given the context, it seems reasonable that after performing certain routines (which could be part of the C2 operations or data preparation for exfiltration), the app would use HTTP to send the gathered information, as this would be a common and somewhat stealthy way to communicate or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A
