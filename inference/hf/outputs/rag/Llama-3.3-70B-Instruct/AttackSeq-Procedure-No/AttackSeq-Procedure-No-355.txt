To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Suckfly, is scanning the internal network for hosts with specific open ports. This action is aimed at identifying potential expansion points within the network. After identifying these points, the question asks if Suckfly is likely to use hacktools for lateral movement and then use a signed credential-dumping tool for obtaining account credentials.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests the use of valid accounts to gain initial access to a network. However, the question already implies that Suckfly has some level of access since they are scanning the internal network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves scanning for open ports and services, which aligns with the initial action described in the question (scanning for hosts with open ports 8080, 5900, and 40).
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This involves obtaining account credentials by dumping the operating system's credential store, which could be a step after gaining access and moving laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action (scanning for open ports) matches the **Discovery** tactic, specifically **T1046-Network Service Discovery**. This is about identifying potential targets or expansion points within the network.
   - After identifying potential targets, the next logical step for an attacker would be to **move laterally** within the network. While the provided TTPs do not explicitly mention lateral movement techniques, using hacktools for this purpose is a common approach in real-world attacks. Lateral movement often involves using valid accounts or exploiting vulnerabilities, which can be facilitated by the initial discovery phase.
   - Finally, using a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic, specifically **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**. This would be a plausible next step after moving laterally, as it allows the attacker to gain more credentials, potentially elevating their privileges or expanding their reach within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Suckfly scans the network for open ports, which matches the **Discovery** tactic and **T1046-Network Service Discovery** technique.
   - **Step 2**: After identifying potential targets, Suckfly would logically move laterally within the network, potentially using hacktools. Although the specific technique for lateral movement is not listed among the provided TTPs, it's a common step following network discovery.
   - **Step 3**: Finally, using a signed credential-dumping tool for obtaining account credentials aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic and **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** technique.

Given the logical progression from network discovery to lateral movement and then to credential dumping, and considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Suckfly would indeed use hacktools to move laterally and then use a signed credential-dumping tool.

**Final Answer: A**
