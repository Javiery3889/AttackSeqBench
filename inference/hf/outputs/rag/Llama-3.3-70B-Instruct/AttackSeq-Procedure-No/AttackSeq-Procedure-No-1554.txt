To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would first copy data from social media to impersonate targeted individuals and then use this information to gain initial access through spear phishing emails that contain OLE2 format documents with embedded links.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**: This is about how attackers gain initial access to a system or network.
   - **Technique: T1566 - Phishing**: Phishing involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. It's a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link**: This is a subset of phishing that involves sending targeted emails with malicious links to specific individuals or groups, aiming to trick them into clicking on the link to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where attackers first gather information (potentially from social media) to impersonate targets, and then use spear phishing with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links to gain initial access.
   - The related TTPs directly support the use of phishing and spear phishing as methods for initial access. The scenario described fits within these techniques, as it involves using gathered information to make the phishing attempt more targeted and believable (spear phishing), with the goal of gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers need a way to make their phishing attempts more believable, which could involve gathering information from social media to impersonate targets.
   - **Step 2**: The use of spear phishing with embedded links in emails (T1566.002) aligns with the described method of attack, as it involves targeting specific individuals with tailored emails.
   - **Step 3**: The inclusion of OLE2 format documents with embedded links in these emails is a plausible vector for delivering malware or exploiting vulnerabilities, fitting the initial access tactic.

Given the information and the related TTPs, it seems plausible that the Freakyshelly attackers would engage in such activities to increase the effectiveness of their spear phishing campaigns.

**Final Answer: A**
