To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has compromised SolarWinds, using the Sunburst backdoor delivered through a supply-chain attack for initial access. It then asks if it's likely that the Sunburst backdoor will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of its network traffic when communicating with its Command and Control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for communication with the C2 server, which can be used to disguise the nature of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique is about gaining initial access by compromising the software supply chain, which is how the Sunburst backdoor was delivered.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to disguise the destination of the C2 traffic, making it appear as if the communication is with a legitimate domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of domain fronting (T1090.004) is a technique specifically designed to evade detection by making the malicious traffic appear as though it is communicating with a legitimate service or domain. Given that the Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated piece of malware designed to remain stealthy, using domain fronting would be a plausible method for it to communicate with its C2 server without arousing suspicion.
   - The fact that the attackers have already demonstrated sophistication by compromising the software supply chain (T1195.002) and using a backdoor for initial access suggests they would also use advanced techniques for C2 communication, such as domain fronting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial access method - The attackers used a supply-chain attack to deliver the Sunburst backdoor.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the sophistication of the attack - The use of a supply-chain attack indicates a high level of sophistication.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the C2 communication techniques - Domain fronting is a technique that aligns with the need to disguise C2 traffic.
   - **Step 4**: Conclusion - Given the sophistication of the attack and the need to maintain stealth, using domain fronting for C2 communication is plausible.

Final Answer: A
