To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described order of events based on the provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) using remote templates in Microsoft Word. Following this, it questions whether the attackers would establish persistence by writing to a specific PowerShell script location (`%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1`) and using a run key in the registry before deploying a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 for initial access fits this technique.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This TTP involves using run keys or startup folders to maintain persistence on a compromised system. Writing to a location like `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploitation (T1203) is used to gain access, which is a common first step in many attacks.
   - Establishing persistence (T1547.001) is a logical next step after initial access to ensure the attackers can maintain their foothold in the system even after the initial session is closed or the system is restarted.
   - Deploying a backdoor like POWERSHOWER would typically follow establishing persistence, as it provides a means for the attackers to regain access to the system at a later time.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first exploit a vulnerability to gain initial access.
   - To maintain access over time, they would need to establish persistence.
   - Using a run key and writing to a specific script location are methods to achieve persistence.
   - Only after ensuring they can persist on the system would it make sense to deploy additional tools like a backdoor, as these tools rely on the persistence mechanisms to survive system restarts or other events that might terminate their processes.

**Final Answer: A**
