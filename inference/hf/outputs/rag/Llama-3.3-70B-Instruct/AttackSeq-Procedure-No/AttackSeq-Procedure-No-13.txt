To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT42, an advanced persistent threat group, sends spear-phishing emails to additional targets, leveraging the victim's trusted relationships. It then asks if it's likely that APT42 will conduct internal reconnaissance by accessing the user's contacts and extracting system and network information only after moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within an internal network to gain access to sensitive data or systems. 
   - **Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using spear-phishing emails that are sent to users within the same organization, often leveraging the trust associated with internal communications.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as compromising email accounts.
   - **Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves using compromised email accounts as a resource for future operations, which can include accessing sensitive information, sending phishing emails, or moving laterally within an organization.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where APT42 uses spear-phishing to compromise additional targets, leveraging trusted relationships. This aligns with **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**.
   - After compromising these targets, the next logical step for APT42, as described, would be to **move laterally** within the network. This lateral movement could indeed involve using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts, fitting the **T1586.002-Email Accounts** technique under the **Resource Development** tactic.
   - The act of accessing the user's contacts and extracting system and network information can be considered part of the reconnaissance phase, which is a common step after initial access and lateral movement. This reconnaissance is crucial for understanding the network layout, identifying valuable targets, and planning further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT42 uses internal spear-phishing to compromise targets, leveraging trusted relationships.
   - **Step 2**: The group moves laterally within the network, potentially using compromised email accounts (personal and then corporate) as part of their **Resource Development** and **Lateral Movement** tactics.
   - **Step 3**: After gaining access and moving laterally, conducting internal reconnaissance to gather more information about the network and potential targets is a logical next step.
   
Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that APT42 would conduct internal reconnaissance after moving laterally, as this aligns with typical adversary behavior post-compromise.

**Final Answer: A**
