To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after performing initial reconnaissance, uses the Rising Sun implant to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. The communication method mentioned is the Jabber/XMPP protocol, and the data exfiltration method involves Base64 encoding. The question asks if it's likely that this communication would occur with servers operated by Google.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Command and Control and the technique of Standard Encoding (T1132.001). This indicates that the focus is on how attackers communicate with compromised systems and how they encode data for exfiltration or communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Command and Control (C2) Communication**: The use of Jabber/XMPP for C2 communication is plausible as it's a known method used by various malware and implants for communicating with C2 servers due to its ability to blend in with normal network traffic.
    - **Standard Encoding (T1132.001)**: The use of Base64 encoding for data exfiltration is also a common tactic. Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate data, making it less detectable by security software.
    - **Servers Operated by Google**: The question's specificity about communicating with servers operated by Google using Jabber/XMPP for C2 before exfiltrating data encoded with Base64 seems unusual. Typically, C2 servers are operated by the attackers themselves, not by legitimate companies like Google. However, it's possible that compromised infrastructure or services could be used, but this would not typically be described as "operated by Google" in the context of malicious activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The initial reconnaissance and the use of an implant like Rising Sun for C2 communication are plausible steps in a cyber attack.
    - The use of Jabber/XMPP for C2 and Base64 for encoding data are both known tactics used by attackers.
    - However, the implication that these activities are directly associated with servers "operated by Google" in a malicious context raises questions. Google operates many services, including those that could potentially be used or compromised for C2 communication (e.g., Google Drive, Google Docs), but the phrasing suggests a direct operation by Google, which is unlikely.

Given the information and focusing on the plausibility of the sequence of events described, the most critical aspect to consider is the involvement of "servers operated by Google" in a malicious C2 operation, which seems misleading or incorrect in this context. Thus, the scenario as described, particularly with the emphasis on Google-operated servers, does not align well with typical attack patterns where C2 infrastructure is concerned.

**Final Answer: B**
