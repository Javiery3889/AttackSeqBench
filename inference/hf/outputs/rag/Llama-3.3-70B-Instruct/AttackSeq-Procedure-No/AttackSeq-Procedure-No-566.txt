To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether attackers are likely to have used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) as their initial access vector. This implies we are looking at the steps or tactics an attacker might use before executing a supply chain compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically technique T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) and its sub-technique T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain). These techniques involve compromising the supply chain of a target organization, often through manipulating software updates or the software development process itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - **T1195 Supply Chain Compromise** involves attackers inserting malicious code or manipulating software updates to gain access to a target system. This technique does not inherently require the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services beforehand.
    - **T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain** is a more specific instance of supply chain compromise, focusing on the software supply chain. Again, this does not necessarily involve the use of legitimate credentials for initial access.
    - The question of whether attackers leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before executing the supply chain compromise is about the preparatory steps or alternative methods attackers might use. However, the primary technique described (T1195) does not inherently require such actions as a precursor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The supply chain compromise (T1195) is a technique that can be executed without the need for legitimate credentials to log into external remote services as a precursor. 
    - The focus of T1195 and its sub-technique is on compromising the software or updates directly, which can be done through various means (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the software development process, bribing or coercing developers, etc.) that do not necessarily involve logging into external remote services with legitimate credentials.
    - Therefore, while it's possible that attackers could use legitimate credentials for other parts of their campaign, it's not a likely or necessary step specifically for executing a supply chain compromise as described.

Final Answer: B
