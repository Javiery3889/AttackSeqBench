To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, presumably Vyveva, is involved in collecting files from a compromised computer. Before collecting these files, the backdoor compresses them using zlib for transmission to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question specifically asks if it's likely that the backdoor would collect files only after obtaining system information such as the computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This TTP involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files, but the description is broad and encompasses any data that can be gathered from the system.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP is specifically about discovering system information, which includes details like the computer name, OS version, architecture, and local IP address. This technique is typically used in the early stages of an attack to understand the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: first, obtaining system information, and then collecting files. 
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** aligns with the initial action of gathering system details, which is a common first step for attackers to understand their target.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** could involve collecting files, which aligns with the second action mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Attackers typically start by gathering system information to understand the environment they are operating in. This is a logical first step for any further actions, including exfiltrating data.
   - Collecting system information (T1082) before collecting files (T1005) makes sense because understanding the system's specifics can help in identifying what files are worth collecting and how to collect them without being detected.
   - The use of zlib for compressing files suggests an effort to efficiently transmit data back to the C&C server, which is consistent with the behavior of a backdoor like Vyveva aiming to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A**
