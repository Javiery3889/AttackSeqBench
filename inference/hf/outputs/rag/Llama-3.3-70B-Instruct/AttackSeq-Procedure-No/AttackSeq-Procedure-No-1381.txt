To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically FIN13, has already moved laterally in a network using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and custom web shells. The question asks if it's likely that FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via specific techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and using trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, **Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This involves modifying authentication processes to gain access to credentials or to maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, **Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This involves obtaining credentials by dumping the memory of the LSASS process, which handles authentication on Windows systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The techniques mentioned (T1556 and T1003.001) are both related to credential access, which is a crucial step for an attacker to move laterally within a network and to escalate privileges.
   - The use of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement indicates that the attacker is already within the network and is looking to expand their access and control.
   - Obtaining credentials through methods like LSASS memory dumping and using trojanized KeePass binaries would provide the attacker with the necessary access to discover and potentially exploit services within the network.
   - System service discovery would logically follow the obtaining of credentials as it would allow the attacker to identify potential targets for further exploitation or to maintain persistence within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already gained initial access and is moving laterally, indicating a need for deeper network understanding and access.
   - **Step 2**: The techniques mentioned (LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries) are used for credential access, which is necessary for deeper network exploration and service discovery.
   - **Step 3**: System service discovery is a logical next step after obtaining credentials, as it would help in identifying vulnerable services or services that could be exploited for further access or persistence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is logical that FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery after obtaining the necessary credentials. This aligns with the typical progression of an attack where initial access is followed by credential access, and then service discovery for further exploitation or persistence.

Final Answer: A
