To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably FIN13, is in the process of compromising a network. The steps mentioned include:
   - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase.
   - The potential use of software deployment tools (like PDQ Deploy) to move AvosLocker (a type of ransomware) and other tools across the network for lateral movement.
   - Collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves transferring tools within a compromised network to maintain access and execute further attacks.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment systems to distribute malware or tools within a network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This involves the attacker discovering files and directories on the compromised systems to understand the network layout and potential targets.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of actions that align with the tactics of discovery, lateral movement, and potentially exfiltration or manipulation of data.
   - The use of native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance fits with the discovery phase (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).
   - The use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement (T1072-Software Deployment Tools) to spread AvosLocker and other tools across the network is a plausible next step after initial discovery, as it leverages existing network management tools to facilitate movement.
   - Collecting data and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions would follow successful lateral movement and tool deployment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the discovery phase.
   - **Step 2**: The use of software deployment tools for lateral movement is a known tactic (T1072) that fits the scenario of spreading malware and tools across the network.
   - **Step 3**: The goal of collecting data and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions is consistent with the objectives of many cyber attacks, following successful lateral movement.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data, as this aligns with known TTPs and the logical progression of a cyber attack.

Final Answer: A
