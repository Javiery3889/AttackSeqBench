To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing Command and Control (C&C) communication via an IRC channel, a Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host. This includes details such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools or antivirus solutions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery. The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. Technique T1082, System Information Discovery, specifically refers to the adversary attempting to gather detailed information about the system, which can include the operating system, hardware, and software configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The question mentions the establishment of C&C communication, which is a common step in the attack sequence where the malware (in this case, Shellbot) communicates with its command and control server to receive instructions or send back data.
   - The next logical step after establishing communication would be for the malware to gather information about the infected host. This is crucial for the adversary to understand the environment they are operating in, identify potential security measures (like Splunk or antivirus solutions), and decide on the next steps of the attack.
   - Technique T1082-System Information Discovery directly aligns with the actions described in the question, as it involves collecting system information that could include processor details and installed software.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Establishing C&C communication is a precursor to further malicious activity.
   - Gathering system information is a logical next step for an adversary to understand the target environment.
   - The described actions (gathering processor information, checking for monitoring tools or antivirus solutions) fit within the scope of System Information Discovery (T1082).
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing C&C communication, a Shellbot would likely engage in activities to gather information about the infected host.

Final Answer: A
