To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SLUB backdoor has already performed discovery by downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet from GitHub for commands. It then asks if it's likely that the attackers will exfiltrate data by directly downloading cloud user data, such as OneDrive files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage. This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services.
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol. This technique involves exfiltrating data over non-standard protocols or channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after the initial discovery, the attackers would directly download cloud user data like OneDrive files as a method of exfiltration. Given the context of the SLUB backdoor's ability to execute commands based on the 'gist' snippet, it's plausible that such commands could include instructions for data exfiltration. However, directly accessing cloud storage like OneDrive might require additional steps or credentials not specified in the initial discovery phase.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that the attackers are unlikely to exfiltrate data in this manner. Considering the techniques provided (T1567.002 and T1048), exfiltration to cloud storage or over alternative protocols are both viable methods for attackers. The question is whether directly downloading cloud user data fits into these tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The SLUB backdoor's initial action of downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet for commands indicates a level of sophistication and the ability to execute commands remotely.
   - The related TTPs suggest that exfiltration is a goal, with specific techniques involving cloud storage and alternative protocols.
   - Directly downloading cloud user data like OneDrive files could be considered a form of exfiltration to cloud storage (if the data is being pulled from the cloud to another location) or exfiltration over alternative protocols (if non-standard methods are used to access this data).
   - However, the direct approach might not always align with the stealthy nature of using backdoors and alternative protocols for exfiltration. Attackers might prefer methods that blend in with normal traffic or are less detectable.

**Final Answer: B**
