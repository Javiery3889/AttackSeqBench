To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the TDrop2 malware communicates with Command and Control (C2) servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands, but with a custom base64 alphabet. This implies the malware is using non-standard encoding techniques for communication. The question then asks if, after this communication, it is likely that the malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This refers to the use of standard encoding schemes (like base64) for hiding or obfuscating data in command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding schemes, which could include custom alphabets for base64 encoding, to hide or obfuscate data in command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system the malware is running on, which could include details about the operating system, hardware, and other system-specific information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a custom base64 alphabet for communication (T1132.002) suggests that the malware is designed to operate stealthily and evade detection. 
   - After establishing communication, the next logical step for the malware, in order to be effective in its mission (whether that be data exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious activities), would be to gather information about the system it is on. This is a common behavior observed in many types of malware, as understanding the environment is crucial for planning subsequent actions.
   - The technique T1082 (System Information Discovery) directly aligns with this need for the malware to understand its environment, making it a plausible next step after establishing command and control communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware uses non-standard encoding for C2 communication, indicating an attempt to hide its activities.
   - Successful communication with C2 servers would typically be followed by gathering information about the compromised system to plan further malicious activities.
   - The technique of System Information Discovery (T1082) is a common next step for malware after establishing C2, as it provides necessary information for further operations.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that after communicating with C2 servers, the TDrop2 malware would indeed perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

Final Answer: A
