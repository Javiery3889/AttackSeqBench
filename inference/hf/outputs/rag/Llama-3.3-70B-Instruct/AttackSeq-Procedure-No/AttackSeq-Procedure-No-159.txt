To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT10, a known advanced persistent threat group, has already identified systems of interest and is using remote command execution scripts to stage data. The question asks if it's likely that APT10 will then conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering systems on the network that can be used for further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves scanning for open network services to identify potential targets or avenues for exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that APT10 has already shown interest in specific systems and is staging data, it suggests they are in the process of gathering intelligence or preparing for further exploitation.
   - The use of remote command execution scripts for staging data indicates they have some level of access and are likely looking to expand their understanding of the network.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** and **T1046-Network Service Discovery** are both techniques used in the discovery phase of an attack, which aligns with the actions of mapping out a network and identifying potential targets or services that can be exploited.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: APT10 has already demonstrated an interest in specific systems and has the capability to execute remote commands, indicating a level of access and intent to further explore the network.
   - **Step 2**: The techniques T1018 and T1046 are directly related to network and system discovery, which would be necessary steps for APT10 to understand the network layout, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan further actions.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is logical that after staging data, APT10 would seek to understand the network better to facilitate movement, identify additional targets, or exfiltrate data.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the actions described, it is likely that APT10 would conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network.

Final Answer: A
