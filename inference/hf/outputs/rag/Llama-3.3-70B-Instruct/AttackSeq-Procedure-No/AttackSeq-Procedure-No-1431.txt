To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after exfiltrating data, the Smooth Operator malware is expected to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) servers. The question specifies the use of HTTP for exfiltration and asks about the likelihood of using HTTPS for C2 communication along with a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the malware uses web protocols (like HTTP or HTTPS) for communicating with its C2 servers. The use of web protocols is a common technique for C2 communication because it can blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that the malware exfiltrates data over the same channel it uses for command and control. This is a common practice as it simplifies the malware's design and reduces the number of potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already used a web protocol (HTTP) for exfiltration, it's reasonable to assume it could use a web protocol for C2 communication as well. The mention of a specific technique (T1071.001) that includes HTTPS as an option supports this.
   - The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common tactic to evade detection. Malware often employs various obfuscation techniques to hide its communication from security tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware uses HTTP for exfiltration, which is a web protocol.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs indicate the use of web protocols for C2 communication and exfiltration over the C2 channel, which aligns with the initial use of HTTP for exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: The use of HTTPS for C2 communication is plausible because it's a web protocol that can be used for this purpose, as indicated by T1071.001.
   - **Step 4**: Employing a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common practice to avoid detection, making it a likely step for the malware.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware would establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation after exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: A
