To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the Korplug variant communicates with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake happening over HTTPS or TCP, before it proceeds to collect data from various sources like the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for communication between the malware and its C&C servers. The ".001" suggests a specific sub-technique involving web protocols.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This refers to the use of protocols that do not rely on the standard application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C&C communication. Custom TCP-based protocols would fall under this category as they operate at a lower layer of the network stack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions an initial handshake over HTTPS (a web protocol) or TCP (which could imply a custom protocol) before data collection. 
   - The related TTPs suggest that the Korplug variant could use both web protocols (T1071.001) for initial communication and a non-application layer protocol (T1095) for its custom TCP-based communication.
   - Given that the initial handshake could occur over HTTPS (a web protocol) and the subsequent communication could utilize a custom TCP-based protocol (non-application layer protocol), it seems plausible that the Korplug variant does indeed communicate with C&C servers in the manner described before collecting data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Korplug variant's use of HTTPS for the initial handshake aligns with T1071.001, indicating web protocol usage.
   - The subsequent use of a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communication aligns with T1095, indicating the use of non-application layer protocols.
   - The sequence described in the question (initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, followed by data collection) is consistent with the tactics and techniques outlined in the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Korplug variant does communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol after an initial handshake, before collecting data.

Final Answer: A
