To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial phase of an attack where an adversary, identified as WINDSHIFT APT, engages in a spear-phishing campaign by sending benign daily emails that mirror local media content. This is done to build a relationship with the target and to track interactions, possibly to understand the target's email reading habits or to establish a level of trust. The question then asks if, following this initial phase, it is likely that the adversary will use fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and exploit social media mobile apps to steal sensitive data as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to resource development and reconnaissance, specifically focusing on the use of social media accounts. 
   - **T1585.001 and T1586.001** are techniques under the tactic of Resource Development, indicating the creation and management of social media accounts for malicious purposes.
   - **T1593.001** falls under the Reconnaissance tactic, suggesting the use of social media for gathering information about targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the initial phase involves building trust and tracking interactions, the next logical steps in a sophisticated attack would involve deeper reconnaissance to gather more specific, identifiable information about the targets. The use of fake social media personas (T1585.001 and T1586.001) aligns with this goal, as it would allow the adversary to gather more personal information under the guise of legitimate social media interactions. Furthermore, exploiting social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents (implied by the use of social media for reconnaissance, T1593.001) would be a natural progression in the attack sequence, providing the adversary with a richer set of data to further their objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial phase of sending benign emails and tracking interactions sets a foundation for further, more invasive reconnaissance.
   - The use of fake social media personas and the exploitation of social media mobile apps for data theft are consistent with the tactics of resource development and reconnaissance.
   - These actions align with known TTPs related to social media usage for malicious purposes.
   - Therefore, given the context and the described TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that WINDSHIFT APT would indeed use such methods as part of their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
