To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers use spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF to gain initial access. After gaining access, it mentions the use of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique involves using a hidden file system to conceal malicious data or tools. The use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system fits within this technique, as it allows attackers to hide their files and activities from the system's normal file system, evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with attachments (like the mentioned PDF file containing spyware) to gain initial access to a system. This aligns with the initial step described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of actions starting with gaining initial access through spearphishing (aligned with T1566.001) and then using a hidden file system (aligned with T1564.005) for defense evasion before communicating with C&C servers.
   - The use of a hidden file system (like a portable FAT16 partition image in %TEMP%) after initial access and before establishing C&C communication is a plausible step for attackers aiming to maintain stealth and evade detection. This action would help in concealing malicious tools or data, facilitating the establishment of a persistent presence on the compromised system without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers gain initial access through spearphishing with a malicious attachment, which is a known and effective tactic.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, using a hidden file system like a portable FAT16 partition image in %TEMP% is a technique that aligns with defense evasion tactics, helping attackers to remain undetected.
   - **Step 3**: Establishing communication with C&C servers would logically follow after setting up a hidden infrastructure for malicious activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware would use such a method to evade detection and establish a covert presence on a compromised system.

Final Answer: A
