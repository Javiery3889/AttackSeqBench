To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the question and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Rising Sun implant, which communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests. It mentions the implant fetching computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities but only after ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control communications, which aligns with the implant communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: Although this technique specifically mentions internet connection discovery, the broader context of the Discovery tactic includes gathering information about the system and its environment, which could encompass fetching computer name and user name information.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves placing a malicious program in the startup folder or modifying registry run keys to ensure the program runs at startup, which aligns with the description of downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder for persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where the implant first communicates with control servers (Command and Control), then ensures persistence (by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder), and finally fetches specific system information (computer name and user name) as part of its discovery activities.
   - The sequence described in the question logically aligns with typical attack patterns where an attacker would first establish a foothold (persistence), then gather information about the system (discovery) to inform further actions.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence: the implant uses web protocols for command and control, ensures persistence through modifying the startup folder, and conducts discovery activities that could include gathering system information like computer and user names.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which is a method of command and control.
   - **Step 2**: The implant ensures persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder, aligning with the persistence tactic.
   - **Step 3**: After establishing persistence, it is logical for the implant to proceed with discovery activities, which could include fetching computer name and user name information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the logical sequence of establishing command and control, ensuring persistence, and then conducting discovery, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would indeed fetch computer name and user name information after ensuring persistence.

Final Answer: A
