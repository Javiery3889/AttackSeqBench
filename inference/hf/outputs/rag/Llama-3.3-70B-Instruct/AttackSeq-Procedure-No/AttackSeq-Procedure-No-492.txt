To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a custom screenshot tool, part of the Harvester's toolkit, captures and archives screenshots. This action is associated with the Collection tactic, specifically the Screen Capture technique (T1113). Following this, the question inquires about the likelihood of the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon using the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This is related to the initial action of capturing screenshots, which is a method used by attackers to gather information from a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This TTP is about using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for communication between the compromised system and the command and control server. This technique can be used for exchanging data, including exfiltrating stolen data or uploading additional malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a custom screenshot tool for screen capture (T1113) indicates an interest in collecting visual information from the target system, which aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - For C2 communication, especially when considering the exfiltration of collected data (like screenshots) or the need to upload additional tools, using file transfer protocols (T1071.002) is a plausible method. FTP, being a standard protocol for file transfer, could be utilized for this purpose, especially in scenarios where the attackers aim to blend in with normal network traffic or exploit existing FTP services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial action (screen capture) and its purpose (collection of information).
   - **Step 2**: Consider the subsequent actions that would logically follow, such as the need for C2 communication to either exfiltrate the collected data or to further compromise the system.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the plausibility of using FTP for C2 communication given the context. FTP is a known method for file transfer and could be used for exchanging data between the compromised system and the attackers' C2 server.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of the Collection tactic followed by the need for C2 communication, and considering the use of file transfer protocols for such communication, it is plausible that the custom backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon could utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
