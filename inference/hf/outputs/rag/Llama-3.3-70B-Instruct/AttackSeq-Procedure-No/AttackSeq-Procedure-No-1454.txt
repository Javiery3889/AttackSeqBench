To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial access phase where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link are sent to ENVYSCOUT. This suggests a phishing campaign aimed at gaining initial access to a target system or network. The question then asks if it's likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves using automation tools like AutoHotKey and AutoIT for executing malicious code. It's a method that can be used in various phases of an attack, including initial access and execution of malware.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique is about using malware for resource development, which means the adversary is utilizing malware to establish a foothold, gather resources, or prepare for further malicious activities within the compromised environment.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial phase involves phishing, which is a common method for delivering malware. The use of custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor during the Resource Development phase would align with the goal of establishing a persistent presence and preparing for further exploitation.
   - The related TTPs indicate the use of automation tools for execution and the employment of malware for resource development. This suggests that the adversary is likely to utilize various tools and techniques, including custom malware, to achieve their objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access method (phishing emails) is a common vector for malware delivery.
   - **Step 2**: The use of custom malware (Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor) would be consistent with the Resource Development phase, as it allows the adversary to maintain access, gather intelligence, and prepare for further actions.
   - **Step 3**: The related TTPs support the notion that the adversary is capable of and likely to use malware as part of their tactics, especially during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer**: A
