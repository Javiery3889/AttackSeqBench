To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and compare them with the provided Related TTPs.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the victim opening an email attachment containing a document with malicious VBA macros. This is a common initial access vector, often leading to the execution of malicious code on the victim's system.

2. **Execution and Reconnaissance**: After initial access, the first stage payload is executed, which gathers system information using commands like SYSTEMINFO and TASKLIST. This step is about understanding the environment and potential vulnerabilities of the compromised system.

3. **Establishing Persistence**: The question then asks about the likelihood of an AutoIt downloader establishing persistence through Windows registry entries under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. This action falls under the tactic of Persistence and specifically utilizes the technique of modifying Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001). Modifying these registry keys allows malware to automatically start whenever the user logs on, thus maintaining persistence on the system.

4. **Software Discovery**: Finally, the question mentions retrieving a list of installed software for software discovery. This step is crucial for the attacker to understand the potential vulnerabilities and applications that can be exploited further.

Given the context and the Related TTPs provided:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** directly supports the action of using registry entries to establish persistence.
- The sequence of actions (initial access, execution, establishing persistence, and then further system reconnaissance like software discovery) is a logical progression in a cyber attack, aiming to secure the attacker's foothold in the system before proceeding with deeper reconnaissance and potential exploitation.

Therefore, considering the logical flow of a cyber attack and the specific techniques mentioned, it is plausible that after achieving initial access and executing the first stage payload, an attacker would seek to establish persistence before proceeding with further actions like software discovery.

Final Answer: A
