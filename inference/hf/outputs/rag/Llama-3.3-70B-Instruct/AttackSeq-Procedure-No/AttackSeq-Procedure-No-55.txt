To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory only after gaining initial access to the victim's network through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, before conducting discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access
   - Technique: T1566 - Phishing
   - Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

   These TTPs indicate that the initial access to the victim's network was gained through phishing, specifically by using spear-phishing attachments. This is a common method used by attackers to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with a malicious Word document. This aligns with the provided TTPs, specifically T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment.
   - After gaining initial access, running a backdoor like ThreatNeedle in memory is a plausible next step for an attacker. This would allow the attacker to maintain access and potentially conduct further malicious activities, including discovery activities like system network connections discovery.
   - The sequence described in the question (gaining initial access through spear-phishing and then running a backdoor) is a common attack sequence in many cyber attacks, fitting the tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, which aligns with T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely want to establish a persistent presence, which could involve running a backdoor like ThreatNeedle in memory.
   - **Step 3**: Running the backdoor in memory after initial access, before conducting further discovery activities, is a logical sequence of events for an attacker aiming to maintain access and gather more information about the victim's network.
   
   **Final Answer: A**
