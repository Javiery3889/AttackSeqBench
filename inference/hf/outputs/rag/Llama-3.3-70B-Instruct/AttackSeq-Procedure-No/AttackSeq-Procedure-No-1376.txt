To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 uses a malicious document that leverages the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell to execute encoded commands. It then asks if it's likely for the document to hijack legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware execution on system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order used by the operating system to load DLLs, allowing an adversary to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is a method used to evade defenses.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands. DDE is a protocol that allows data to be exchanged between applications, and it can be exploited to execute malicious commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of DDE to achieve execution, which aligns with **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**. This technique is about executing commands, which is what the malicious document does by leveraging DDE via PowerShell.
   - The question then asks about hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts for malware execution on startup. While the provided TTPs include **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** under Defense Evasion, the specific action of hijacking startup scripts for persistence isn't directly described by the given TTPs. However, the concept of hijacking or manipulating system or application behaviors for malicious purposes (like persistence) is related to defense evasion tactics.
   - Given that the initial execution is achieved through DDE, and considering typical adversary behaviors, it's plausible that after achieving initial execution, an adversary would seek to maintain access or ensure persistence, which could involve hijacking legitimate processes or scripts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action described (using DDE for execution) is a known tactic for achieving execution.
   - The follow-up action (hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts for persistence) aligns with common adversary goals post-initial access, such as maintaining access or evading detection.
   - Although the specific TTP for hijacking startup scripts isn't listed, the behavior fits within the broader context of defense evasion and persistence tactics.
   - Therefore, considering typical attack sequences and the goals of adversaries like APT28, it is likely that after achieving initial execution, the document would attempt to hijack legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware execution on system startup.

Final Answer: A
