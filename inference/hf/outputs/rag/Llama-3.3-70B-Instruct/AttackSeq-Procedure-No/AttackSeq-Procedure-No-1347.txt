To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has managed to evade detection by using overlay screens during the installation of a payload app, specifically mentioning the "callCam app." It then asks if it's likely that this app would use RSA and AES encryption for data exfiltration to a Command and Control (C&C) server before collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This indicates that the attacker's goal includes collecting data from the compromised system, which could include files and screenshots.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This suggests that the attacker might use encryption or encoding to evade detection, which aligns with the use of encryption algorithms like RSA and AES for hiding or protecting the data they intend to exfiltrate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This further supports the idea that the attacker would use methods to obscure their files or information, making it harder for defenders to detect their activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the tactics and techniques mentioned, it's clear that the attacker's strategy involves evading detection and collecting data. The use of encryption (like RSA and AES) for exfiltrating data to a C&C server fits within the Defense Evasion tactic, as it helps in hiding the data being exfiltrated.
   - The question specifies that this encryption happens before collecting files and screenshots, which might seem slightly out of order since one would expect data collection to happen before exfiltration. However, the question's focus is on the likelihood of using encryption for exfiltration as part of the attack sequence, which includes data collection as a broader objective.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already evaded detection through overlay screens, indicating a level of sophistication.
   - The use of encryption algorithms like RSA and AES for data exfiltration is a common tactic to further evade detection and protect stolen data.
   - The related TTPs support the use of encryption and obfuscation for defense evasion, which aligns with the scenario described.
   - Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is plausible that the callCam app would use encryption for exfiltration as part of its operation.

Final Answer: A
