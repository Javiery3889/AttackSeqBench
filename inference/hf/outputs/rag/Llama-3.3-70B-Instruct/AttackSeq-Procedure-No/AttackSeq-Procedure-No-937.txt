To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT gains initial access by disguising malware as legitimate software updates. It then asks if it's likely that they would compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations before performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves adversaries attempting to make their malicious activity appear as normal or benign as possible by matching the name or location of legitimate files, processes, or other system components. This could be relevant to how the malware is disguised.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain initial access. While the question mentions disguising malware as software updates, using valid accounts could be a method to further establish a foothold or move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1591.002-Business Relationships**: This involves gathering information about a target's business relationships, which could include details about travel plans or other sensitive information relevant to the target's operations or personal life.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where initial access is gained through disguising malware as legitimate software updates. This action is aimed at evading defenses and establishing a foothold within the target's network.
   - Compromising trusted commercial network resources to support operations could be a step taken after initial access, as it would provide the adversary with additional capabilities or resources to conduct their operations, such as using compromised networks to gather intelligence or launch further attacks.
   - Reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of victims' whereabouts and travel plans would logically follow the establishment of a secure foothold within the target's network. This is because understanding the target's movements and plans would require access to sensitive information, which the adversary would need to gather after they have secured their access and can operate without immediate detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Darkhotel APT's actions, as described, suggest a sophisticated and targeted approach, focusing on evading detection and gathering specific types of intelligence.
   - Given the techniques mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that after gaining initial access, the next steps would involve securing their position within the network (which could involve compromising trusted resources) and then using that position to gather more specific intelligence about their targets.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Darkhotel APT would compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations before performing detailed reconnaissance, as this would align with a strategy of securing a foothold, expanding their capabilities, and then gathering specific intelligence.

Final Answer: A
