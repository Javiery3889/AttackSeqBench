To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether APT28, after deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C (Command and Control) server, is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward. This implies a sequence of actions where the deployment of modules for data upload precedes the discovery activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery
   These TTPs are related to the discovery phase of an attack, where an adversary seeks to gather information about the target environment, such as identifying remote systems and network services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The question implies a specific sequence of events: first, the deployment of modules for uploading stolen data, and then the performance of discovery activities.
   - The deployment of modules like pr.dll for uploading stolen data suggests that APT28 has already gained access to the target network and is in the process of exfiltrating data.
   - The discovery techniques mentioned (T1018 and T1046) are typically used to gather information about the target environment, which can be done at various stages of an attack, including before, during, and after the deployment of such modules.
   - Given that APT28 has already deployed modules for data upload, it suggests they have some level of access and may have performed initial discovery to reach this point. However, the question asks if they are likely to perform discovery "only afterward," which implies a linear progression that might not accurately reflect real-world attack sequences.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of APT28's actions and the purpose of deploying additional modules.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the role of discovery in the attack lifecycle and how T1018 and T1046 fit into this.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of APT28 performing discovery activities after deploying data upload modules, considering that discovery can occur at multiple stages of an attack.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the nature of APT28's activities and the fact that discovery is an ongoing process throughout an attack, it's unlikely that discovery would only happen after deploying modules for data upload. Discovery is a continuous process that can occur before, during, and after the deployment of such modules to identify new targets, services, or vulnerabilities within the compromised network.

Final Answer: B
