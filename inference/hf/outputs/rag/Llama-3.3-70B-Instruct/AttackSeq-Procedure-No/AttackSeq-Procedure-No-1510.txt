To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that the Carbanak group used specific techniques (LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks) to achieve certain goals within an organization's network, such as mapping the internal network, collecting administrative-level credentials, and compromising additional endpoints.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics and Techniques (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, with the technique **T1557.001 - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**. This indicates that the attackers are using these poisoning and relay techniques to gain access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Collection**, also with the technique **T1557.001 - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**. This shows that the same techniques are used for collecting information, which can include network mapping and gathering credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Carbanak group is known for sophisticated attacks, including those that involve gaining access to sensitive areas of a network.
   - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks are effective methods for gaining unauthorized access to credentials and moving laterally within a network.
   - The use of these techniques aligns with the tactics of Credential Access and Collection, as they can be used to both obtain credentials (e.g., by intercepting and relaying authentication requests) and to collect information about the network structure and available resources.
   - Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator would be a high-priority goal for attackers, as it provides broad access to the network and its resources.
   - Using compromised credentials to compromise additional endpoints is a common tactic for spreading within a network and achieving the attackers' objectives, whether they be data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or other malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Carbanak group's known sophistication and history of complex attacks make it plausible they would use advanced techniques like LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay.
   - **Step 2**: These techniques are directly related to the tactics of Credential Access and Collection, which are essential for network compromise and exploration.
   - **Step 3**: The sequence of events described (using these techniques to map the network, collect administrative credentials, and then compromise additional endpoints) follows a logical and commonly observed pattern in cyber attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the context provided by the related TTPs, it is indeed likely that the Carbanak group would conduct such attacks to achieve their objectives within an organization's network.

Final Answer: A
