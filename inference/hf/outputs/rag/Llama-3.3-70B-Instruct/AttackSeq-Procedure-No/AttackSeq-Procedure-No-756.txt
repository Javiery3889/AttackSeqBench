To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has performed initial reconnaissance. It then asks if it is likely that the implant communicated with its Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. The key elements here are the use of blogs and WordPress as a means of communication between the implant and the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Command and Control and the technique of T1102.002, which is about bidirectional communication. This technique involves the ability of the adversary to communicate with the compromised system and for the compromised system to communicate back to the adversary. The use of blogs and WordPress could potentially fit into this category as an unconventional means of command and control, leveraging existing infrastructure for covert communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after initial reconnaissance is a plausible next step. Given that T1102.002 includes various methods for bidirectional communication and considering the creative ways adversaries use existing infrastructure for C2 communications, this option seems feasible. Adversaries often exploit common services and platforms to blend in with normal traffic, making their communications harder to detect.
    - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that using blogs and WordPress for such communication is unlikely. While traditional C2 communications might involve dedicated servers or more direct methods, the evolving nature of cyber threats and the use of legitimate services for malicious purposes make this option less convincing given the context of T1102.002.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question asks about the likelihood of using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication post-reconnaissance.
    - The related TTPs highlight bidirectional communication as a key aspect of command and control tactics.
    - Adversaries are known to use legitimate platforms and services for covert operations, including C2 communications.
    - Given the context and the nature of modern cyber threats, using blogs and WordPress for such purposes, although unconventional, aligns with the broader tactic of leveraging existing infrastructure for stealthy operations.

Final Answer: A
