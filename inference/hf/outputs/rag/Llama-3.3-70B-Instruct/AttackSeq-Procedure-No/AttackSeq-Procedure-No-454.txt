To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after exhibiting lateral movement within an internal network, APT-TOCS is likely to use removable media for command and control (C2) operations. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT-TOCS, particularly in the context of lateral movement and C2 communications.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to move laterally within a network. It's a method attackers use to spread within a network, especially in environments where network connectivity between systems is limited or segmented.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**: This technique refers to the use of removable media as a means for command and control communication. Instead of relying on network protocols, attackers might use removable media to issue commands or exfiltrate data, especially in air-gapped or highly restricted environments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Lateral Movement via Removable Media (T1091)**: The fact that APT-TOCS exhibits lateral movement through network projection and has a technique like T1091 in its arsenal suggests it can use removable media for spreading within a network.
   - **Command and Control via Removable Media (T1092)**: For C2 operations, using removable media is less common than network-based methods but is plausible, especially in scenarios where network detection would be too risky or impossible due to network restrictions.

Given these points, the question is whether, after moving laterally, APT-TOCS would likely use removable media for C2. The use of removable media for both lateral movement and C2 suggests a scenario where network access might be limited or closely monitored, making removable media an attractive alternative for stealthy operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of APT-TOCS's operations, focusing on lateral movement and C2.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the relevance of T1091 and T1092 in the context of using removable media for both movement and communication.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the plausibility of using removable media for C2 after lateral movement, given the techniques available to APT-TOCS.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the techniques outlined, especially the use of removable media for replication (T1091), it's reasonable to consider that APT-TOCS could use removable media for C2 operations (T1092) as a means to maintain stealth and avoid detection in a network where traditional C2 methods might be heavily monitored.

Final Answer: A
