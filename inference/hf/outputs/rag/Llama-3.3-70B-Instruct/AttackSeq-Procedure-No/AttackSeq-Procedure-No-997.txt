To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a target is infected with Plexor malware via a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document. It then asks if it's likely that Longhorn's tools, which are espionage-focused, will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the "Discovery" tactic. This includes:
   - **T1518.001 - Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to identify what security software is installed on the compromised system, which could help them in evading detection.
   - **T1497.002 - User Activity Based Checks**: This involves checking for signs of user activity that might indicate if a user is currently active on the system or if the system is being used in a way that could interfere with the adversary's goals.
   - **T1083 - File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is about the adversary trying to gather information about the file system and directory structure of the compromised system, which can help in identifying locations of interest for further exploitation or data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the malware used is espionage-focused, the primary goal of the adversary (Longhorn) would likely be to gather as much information as possible from the target system without being detected. The techniques listed under the "Discovery" tactic align perfectly with these goals. Performing system fingerprinting and discovery would provide Longhorn with crucial information about the system's security posture, current user activity, and the layout of the file system. This information is essential for planning subsequent actions, such as where to look for valuable data, how to move laterally within the network, and how to avoid detection by security software.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial infection vector (zero-day exploit in a Word document) suggests a sophisticated attack, likely aimed at espionage given the use of Plexor malware.
   - **Step 2**: The goal of espionage-focused malware is typically to gather information, which requires understanding the target system's environment.
   - **Step 3**: The provided TTPs all support the idea of performing discovery to understand the system better, including its security software, user activity, and file system structure.
   - **Step 4**: Given the importance of discovery in planning and executing a successful espionage operation without being detected, it is logical that Longhorn's tools would perform such actions.

**Final Answer: A**
