To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has deployed DarkComet (a type of malware) along with a credential dumping tool. The goal here is to extract credentials, which aligns with the tactic of Credential Access. The question then asks if it's likely that Elfin (another piece of malware) would bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands before establishing command and control (C2) communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Credential Access. Specifically, they mention:
   - **T1056.001 - Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes to obtain credentials or other sensitive information.
   - **T1552.001 - Credentials In Files**: This technique involves obtaining credentials that are stored in files, which could be achieved through credential dumping tools as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool aligns with the Credential Access tactic, specifically aiming to extract credentials.
   - The use of PowerShell to bypass logging is a common technique (though not explicitly listed in the provided TTPs, it's a known method for attackers to evade detection).
   - The subsequent use of tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for C2 communications is plausible after an attacker has gained access and wants to maintain control over the infected machine.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gains initial access and extracts credentials using DarkComet and a credential dumping tool, fitting the Credential Access tactic.
   - **Step 2**: To maintain stealth, the attacker might use PowerShell to bypass logging, which is a common method to evade detection, even though the specific technique isn't listed among the provided TTPs.
   - **Step 3**: With access secured and logging potentially bypassed, the attacker could then establish C2 communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, which is a logical next step for an attacker looking to exploit the compromised system further.

Given the context and the logical progression of an attack, it seems plausible that after gaining access and extracting credentials, an attacker would take steps to maintain access and control, including bypassing logging mechanisms and establishing C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A**
