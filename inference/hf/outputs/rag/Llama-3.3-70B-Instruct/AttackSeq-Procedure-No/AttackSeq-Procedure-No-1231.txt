To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group uses Hermes ransomware to disrupt a bank's operations. Specifically, it mentions the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, which is a technique used to prevent system recovery. The question asks if the use of backdoor malware for communication with command-and-control servers and execution of remote commands occurred after the deployment of the ransomware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection. In the context of ransomware, deleting files such as Volume Shadow Copies can prevent the system from recovering, which aligns with the use of Hermes ransomware mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**: This technique is about inhibiting system recovery, which directly relates to the action of deleting backup files and Volume Shadow Copies to prevent the bank from easily recovering its systems and data after an attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of events where the initial action is the deployment of ransomware (Hermes) to disrupt operations and prevent recovery by deleting specific files. 
   - The use of backdoor malware for communication with command-and-control servers and executing remote commands is a common tactic in sophisticated attacks to maintain access and control over the compromised system.
   - Given the tactics and techniques mentioned (Defense Evasion and Impact through file deletion and inhibiting system recovery), it's plausible that the Lazarus group would establish a means of persistent access and control (like backdoor malware) either before, during, or after the deployment of the ransomware to manage the attack effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of Hermes ransomware and the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies and backup files are actions aimed at disrupting operations and preventing system recovery.
   - The use of backdoor malware for communication and command execution is a tactic that can be employed at various stages of an attack, including after the initial deployment of ransomware, to maintain control and potentially execute further commands.
   - Considering the tactics of Defense Evasion and Impact, and the techniques of file deletion and inhibiting system recovery, it's reasonable to conclude that the Lazarus group could have used backdoor malware after deploying the ransomware as part of their attack strategy.
   
Final Answer: A
