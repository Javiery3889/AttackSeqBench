To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter. This involves understanding the role of RIG EK, malvertising, and the use of PowerShell in delivering malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.008-Malvertising**: This indicates the use of malicious advertisements to deliver malware. Malvertising can redirect users to exploit kits like RIG EK.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which can be used to fetch and run malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by exploiting vulnerabilities when they visit a compromised website or click on a malicious link, which can lead to the delivery of an exploit kit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where an obfuscated PowerShell script is run to fetch malware, and this is linked to the delivery of exploits through malvertising by RIG EK.
   - The related TTPs provide context: malvertising (T1583.008) can be used to redirect users to RIG EK, which then exploits vulnerabilities (T1189-Drive-by Compromise). The use of PowerShell (T1059.001) to execute scripts and fetch malware aligns with the capability to run obfuscated scripts for malicious purposes.
   - The sequence described in the question suggests a multi-step process where the initial access might be gained through malvertising or drive-by compromise, followed by the execution of PowerShell scripts to further compromise the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the role of RIG EK in delivering exploits and how malvertising can redirect users to such exploit kits.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the use of PowerShell in executing scripts that can fetch and run malware, which aligns with the described sequence of running an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - **Step 3**: Consider how drive-by compromise can lead to the initial infection, which might then be followed by more sophisticated exploitation techniques, including the use of PowerShell for further malicious activity.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the related TTPs, it is plausible that RIG EK could deliver exploits through malvertising and then utilize an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch additional malware, aligning with the tactics and techniques described.

Final Answer: A
