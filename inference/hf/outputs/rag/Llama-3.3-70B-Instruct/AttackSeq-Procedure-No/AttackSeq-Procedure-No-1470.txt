To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has completed reconnaissance activities, including gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. It then asks if it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This indicates that the attackers are interested in understanding user activity to possibly evade detection or to identify vulnerable targets within the network.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This suggests the use of Visual Basic (VBA) macros for execution, which is a common method for delivering malware payloads through documents, especially when employees enable macro execution in their applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of Ruby scripts for executing payloads, but the related TTPs provided focus on the use of Visual Basic (VBA) macros for execution. This discrepancy is crucial because while Ruby can be used for various malicious activities, the specific context provided (employee-enabled macro execution) aligns more closely with the use of VBA macros rather than Ruby scripts.
   - BlackEnergy 3 is known for its versatility in using various components for its operations, including the potential for using different scripting languages. However, the specific method of installation mentioned (through employee-enabled macro execution) is more commonly associated with VBA macros than with Ruby scripts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of the attack, which involves reconnaissance and the use of employee-enabled macro execution for installing malicious implants.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the discrepancy between the question's mention of Ruby scripts and the related TTPs' focus on Visual Basic.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the common methods used by malware like BlackEnergy 3 and the typical use of VBA macros in similar attack scenarios.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the context of employee-enabled macro execution, it seems less likely that Ruby scripts would be the primary method for executing payloads in this specific scenario, especially when the related TTPs highlight the use of Visual Basic.

Final Answer: B
