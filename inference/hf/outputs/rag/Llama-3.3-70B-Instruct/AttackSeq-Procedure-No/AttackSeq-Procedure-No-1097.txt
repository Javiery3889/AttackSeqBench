To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided in the question and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where after exfiltrating data via FTP, the actor (CosmicDuke) is considered likely to use specific tools (keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) for gathering information. This action is mentioned to occur after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection. The question essentially asks if this sequence of actions aligns with the expected behavior of CosmicDuke.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the use of automated techniques to exfiltrate data from a network. The question mentions exfiltration via FTP, which aligns with automated exfiltration methods.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can reveal sensitive information such as passwords or other confidential data.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system, which can include searching for specific files or information on removable drives and the system itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where after exfiltrating data, CosmicDuke uses tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers. This sequence suggests a continued effort to gather more information from the compromised system.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of collecting data through various means (keylogging, collecting data from the local system). However, the specific sequence and tools mentioned (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) after exfiltration and the actions of searching removable drives and skipping file types, need to be evaluated for plausibility.
   - Given that CosmicDuke is known for its capabilities in collecting data through various means, including keylogging and collecting system data, it's plausible that after an initial exfiltration, further collection efforts would focus on gathering more specific or sensitive information that might not have been captured in the initial data transfer.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of CosmicDuke's operations and its known TTPs.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the specific sequence of actions described in the question (exfiltration via FTP, followed by the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer).
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the related TTPs to see if they support the described sequence of actions.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the plausibility of the sequence based on the known behaviors and capabilities of CosmicDuke.
   
Given the information and the steps outlined, the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data and the actions of searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection seems to align with a continued and detailed effort to gather sensitive information. This behavior is consistent with an adversary attempting to maximize the value of the data collected from a compromised system.

Final Answer: A
