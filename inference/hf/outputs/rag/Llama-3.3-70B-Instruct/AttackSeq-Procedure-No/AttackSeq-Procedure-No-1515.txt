To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor installed by attackers is used to shut down a victim's computer, impacting system availability. It then asks if, after this action, it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the Command and Control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This indicates the attackers' goal is to disrupt the system's operation, potentially for sabotage or to create a diversion.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that the attackers are interested in stealing data from the victim's system, using the C2 channel for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of actions starting with system disruption (shutting down the computer) and asks about the likelihood of subsequent data exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs indicate two distinct goals: disrupting the system (Impact) and stealing data (Exfiltration).
   - Typically, exfiltration over a C2 channel, especially when encrypted, is a method used to stealthily remove data from a compromised system without immediate detection.
   - The act of shutting down a system (as per T1529) might seem counterintuitive to the goal of exfiltrating data, as it would terminate any ongoing exfiltration processes. However, if the shutdown is part of a broader strategy (e.g., to cover tracks or as part of a ransomware attack where data exfiltration occurs before shutdown), it's conceivable that exfiltration could occur before or after the shutdown, depending on the attackers' timeline and strategy.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of system shutdown as a tactic for impact.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the potential for data exfiltration over C2 channels as a separate tactic.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the sequence and potential overlap of these tactics in an attack.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of exfiltration after a system shutdown, considering it might be part of a multi-stage attack where exfiltration happens before, during, or after the shutdown, depending on the attackers' goals and strategy.
   
Given the information and the tactics described, while the shutdown might disrupt immediate exfiltration activities, the question's phrasing suggests a consideration of the backdoor's capabilities and the attackers' intentions. If the backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data and the shutdown is part of the attack strategy, it's plausible that exfiltration could occur, potentially even after a restart if the backdoor persists.

**Final Answer: A**
