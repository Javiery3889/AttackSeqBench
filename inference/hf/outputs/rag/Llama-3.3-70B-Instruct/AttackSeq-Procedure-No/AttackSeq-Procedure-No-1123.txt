To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a spear-phishing attack uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access. It then asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in client applications to execute malicious code. The use of a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) falls under this category, as it exploits a client-side application vulnerability.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using malicious files to execute code. The 'show.swf' Flash file mentioned could be an example of a malicious file used for execution.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding payloads within other files (like images) to evade detection. The mention of a payload embedded in a GIF image relates to this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is used for gaining access, which aligns with **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.
   - The use of a malicious Flash file ('show.swf') for execution purposes aligns with **T1204.002-Malicious File**.
   - The embedding of a payload in a GIF image for evasion aligns with **T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**.
   - The question essentially asks if the execution of shellcode for defense evasion (to install a payload) happens after the payload is installed from the GIF image. This seems to imply a sequence where the payload installation and defense evasion are closely linked, potentially in a specific order.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack starts with a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit, which is a method of exploiting client execution vulnerabilities.
   - The 'show.swf' file is a malicious file used for execution, fitting the **T1204.002-Malicious File** technique.
   - The payload is embedded in a GIF image, which is a method of defense evasion (**T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**).
   - The question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence of events where the shellcode execution for defense evasion is contingent upon the installation of the payload from the GIF image. However, typically, the defense evasion techniques (like embedded payloads) are used to facilitate the execution of the malicious code (in this case, the shellcode) rather than the other way around.
   - Given the techniques involved, it seems more plausible that the shellcode would be executed as part of the exploitation process, potentially using defense evasion techniques (like embedded payloads) to avoid detection during or after the payload installation.

Considering the above analysis, the most logical sequence involves the exploitation and execution of malicious code (including any embedded payloads) as part of the initial attack phase, with defense evasion techniques being utilized throughout to avoid detection. Therefore, the notion that the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion **only after** the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image might not accurately reflect the typical sequence of events in such an attack.

**Final Answer: B**
