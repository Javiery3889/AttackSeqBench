To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware uses a Base64-encoded token for communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. It then asks if it's likely for the malware to collect specific information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This indicates the use of standard encoding schemes (like Base64) for C2 communication, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves collecting information about the system, which could include basic system details but might not directly imply the collection of personal data like text messages or contact lists.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the file system and directories on the compromised system, which could potentially include discovering files containing personal data but doesn't directly imply the collection of geo-location data or other specific personal information mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of a Base64-encoded token for C2 communication, which aligns with **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**.
   - The collection of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase seems more invasive and specific than what **T1082-System Information Discovery** and **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** directly imply. However, these techniques could be part of a broader discovery effort that includes gathering sensitive user data, depending on the malware's objectives.
   - Given the context of C2 communication and the potential for malware to gather a wide range of information during the Discovery phase, it's plausible that such specific data could be targeted, especially if the malware is designed for espionage or personal data theft.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of Base64 encoding for C2 communication suggests sophisticated communication tactics.
   - The Discovery phase, while typically focused on system and network reconnaissance, can be broad in scope and may include gathering sensitive user data if the malware is designed to do so.
   - The specific techniques mentioned (T1082 and T1083) don't directly cover the collection of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, but the Discovery phase can encompass a wide range of information gathering activities.
   - Given the potential breadth of the Discovery phase and the capabilities implied by the use of C2 communication with encoded tokens, it's reasonable to consider that the malware could collect such information.

Final Answer: A
