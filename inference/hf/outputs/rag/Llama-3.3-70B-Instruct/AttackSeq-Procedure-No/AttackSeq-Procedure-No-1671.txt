To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where reconnaissance has been conducted to gather various system and network information. It then asks if it's likely that the Dark Seoul attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access only after completing the initial access phase. The key elements here are the use of spear-phishing for initial access and the timing of this action in relation to the initial access phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are all under the tactic of Initial Access. The techniques include:
   - T1566: Phishing, which is a broad technique that involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions.
   - T1566.002: Spearphishing Link, a specific type of phishing that involves sending links to malicious websites.
   - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment, which involves sending emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: The question mentions that reconnaissance has already been conducted, which implies that the attackers have already gained some level of access to the system to gather such detailed information. The use of spear-phishing (either through links or attachments) is typically an initial step in the attack chain, aimed at gaining initial access to a system or network. The question, however, suggests that spear-phishing was used "only after completing the initial access phase," which seems counterintuitive to the typical use of spear-phishing as a means to achieve initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Spear-phishing is commonly used for initial access, not after initial access has been achieved.
   - The reconnaissance activities described suggest that the attackers already have some level of access to the system.
   - Using spear-phishing after initial access does not align with the typical attack sequence where spear-phishing is a precursor to gaining access.

**Final Answer: B**
