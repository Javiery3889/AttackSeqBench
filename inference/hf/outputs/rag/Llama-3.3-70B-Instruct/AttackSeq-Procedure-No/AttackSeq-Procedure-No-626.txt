To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign has established communication with Command and Control (C2) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. It then asks if it's likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This indicates the use of protocol tunneling to bypass security controls and establish C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that data exfiltration can occur over the established C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This implies exfiltration can also happen over non-C2 protocols that are not encrypted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifies the use of protocol tunneling for C2 communication, which aligns with T1572.
   - For exfiltration, the techniques provided suggest two main methods: exfiltration over the established C2 channel (T1041) and exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols (T1048.003).
   - The question asks about exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS, which are encrypted protocols, but specifically mentions using a "non-C2 protocol." This seems to slightly misalign with the provided techniques since T1048.003 refers to unencrypted protocols, not encrypted ones like HTTPS or SMTPS.
   - However, considering the context of using established C2 channels for exfiltration (T1041), and given that HTTPS and SMTPS are secure protocols that could be used for C2 communication or exfiltration, the question's reference to "non-C2 protocol" might be intended to test understanding of typical exfiltration methods beyond the standard C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's use of protocol tunneling for C2 communication suggests a sophisticated approach to evading detection.
   - The SombRAT backdoor, being part of this campaign, likely has the capability to exfiltrate data in a manner that minimizes detection, such as using encrypted channels.
   - Given the techniques provided, exfiltration over the C2 channel (which could include encrypted protocols like HTTPS if used as part of the C2 communication) seems plausible.
   - However, the specific mention of "non-C2 protocol" and the reference to HTTPS or SMTPS (encrypted protocols) introduces a bit of confusion since the related TTPs do not directly address encrypted non-C2 protocols for exfiltration.
   - Considering the intent might be to understand if the backdoor can exfiltrate data using methods that are not the primary C2 channel but are still secure, one could argue that using HTTPS or SMTPS (even if not directly mentioned in the TTPs as non-C2 protocols for exfiltration) could be a plausible method for exfiltration given their encrypted nature and common use in communication.

Given the above analysis and focusing on the question's specifics about using a "non-C2 protocol" for exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS, and considering the provided TTPs, the most direct answer based on typical threat actor behavior and the information given would lean towards the capability of the backdoor to exfiltrate data in various ways, including potentially using secure protocols for exfiltration beyond the primary C2 channel. However, the question's framing around "non-C2 protocol" and the specific techniques listed introduces complexity.

**Final Answer: A**
