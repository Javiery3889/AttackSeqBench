To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware, BlueBravo, uses HTTPS for Command and Control (C2) communication and cloud services like Microsoft OneDrive and potentially DropBox for bidirectional communication. It then asks if, after establishing this communication, it is likely for the malware to gather system information such as username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP is about the adversary gathering information about the system, which could include details like the username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and running processes. This technique is typically used to understand the environment in which the adversary is operating.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This TTP involves using cloud services for bidirectional communication between the adversary and the compromised system. This can be used for sending commands to the malware and receiving data back from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 communication and cloud services for bidirectional communication (T1102.002) suggests that the malware is capable of communicating with its command and control servers and potentially exfiltrating data or receiving further instructions.
   - The gathering of system information (T1082-System Information Discovery) is a common step after initial compromise, as it helps the adversary understand the system's configuration, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan further actions.
   - Given that the malware has established a means of communication, it is logical that the next step would involve gathering more information about the system it has compromised. This information is crucial for deciding the next steps, such as which vulnerabilities to exploit, what data to exfiltrate, or whether to move laterally within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware establishes communication using HTTPS and cloud services, indicating a successful initial compromise.
   - **Step 2**: With communication established, the next logical step for the adversary would be to gather more information about the compromised system to inform further actions.
   - **Step 3**: Given the techniques mentioned (T1082-System Information Discovery and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication), it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing communication, the malware would indeed gather system information.
   
**Final Answer: A**
