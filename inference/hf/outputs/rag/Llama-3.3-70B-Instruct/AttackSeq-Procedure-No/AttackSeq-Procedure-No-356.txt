To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, identified as Suckfly, is engaged in activities within a corporate internal network. The attacker has scanned for hosts with specific open ports (8080, 5900, and 40), which suggests they are looking for potential entry or expansion points within the network. The question then asks if, after this scanning, Suckfly is likely to gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services (like Azure AD Connect) from a local machine and then use hacktools to move laterally within the network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network. It implies the use of shared network resources to access other systems.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves transferring tools within a network to facilitate lateral movement. It suggests the attacker is using tools to expand their access within the network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about discovering services on a network, which aligns with the initial scanning activity described in the question for open ports.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial scanning activity (discovery of open ports) aligns with **T1046-Network Service Discovery**.
   - The subsequent actions described (gathering unsecured credentials for Azure AD services and using hacktools for lateral movement) fit within the context of **Lateral Movement** tactics, specifically techniques like **T1021.002** and **T1570**.
   - Gathering credentials, especially for services like Azure AD Connect, would be a strategic move to facilitate deeper access and control within the network, aligning with the goal of lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker scans the network for potential entry points, which is a common initial step in network exploitation.
   - **Step 2**: Identifying open ports and services (like those for Azure AD) could provide a pathway for gathering credentials, especially if those services are not properly secured.
   - **Step 3**: With credentials in hand, especially for a service like Azure AD Connect, an attacker could leverage these to move laterally within the network, using techniques like SMB/Windows Admin Shares or transferring tools laterally.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after identifying potential expansion points, Suckfly would attempt to gather unsecured credentials to facilitate lateral movement within the network.

Final Answer: A
