To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a specific behavior of the Waterbear backdoor, focusing on its communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server, the use of XOR-encrypted addresses, and the potential use of API hooking techniques for defense evasion. Specifically, it mentions modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' to mask processes and TCP endpoints after loading incoming executables.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This indicates the use of native APIs to execute code, which could be relevant to how the Waterbear backdoor interacts with the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This refers to techniques used to block or modify indicators that might be used to detect the malware, which aligns with the concept of defense evasion through API hooking.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question asks if the Waterbear backdoor would use API hooking to modify specific system calls ('ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable') for defense evasion after loading executables. 
   - The use of API hooking for modifying system calls like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' is a common technique for hiding malicious activity, such as masking processes and network connections, which fits within the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - The mention of loading incoming executables suggests a phase of the attack where the malware is executing code, which aligns with the Execution tactic and the use of Native API (T1106).
   - Given that the Waterbear backdoor is communicating with a C&C server and using XOR-encrypted addresses, it's reasonable to assume it's capable of sophisticated evasion techniques, including API hooking for defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of the Waterbear backdoor's behavior, including its communication methods and potential for defense evasion.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the relevance of the provided TTPs to the behaviors described in the question, specifically the use of Native API for execution and Indicator Blocking for defense evasion.
   - **Step 3**: Analyze how API hooking for modifying system calls like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' fits into the tactics of Defense Evasion and Execution.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication of the Waterbear backdoor in communicating with its C&C server and the relevance of the provided TTPs to the behaviors in question, it is plausible that the Waterbear backdoor would use API hooking techniques for defense evasion after loading incoming executables.

Final Answer: A
