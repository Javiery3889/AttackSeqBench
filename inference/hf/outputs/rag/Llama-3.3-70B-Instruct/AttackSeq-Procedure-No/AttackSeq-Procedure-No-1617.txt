To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether Regin, after engaging in network traffic monitoring and sniffing for collection purposes, is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase. This implies we are looking at the behaviors of Regin malware during its discovery phase, specifically focusing on information gathering activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information about the network and its hosts. This is relevant as it matches the initial behavior described in the question (monitoring network traffic and sniffing).
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include details about the operating system, hardware, and configurations. While not directly mentioned, gathering system information could encompass understanding processes and potentially memory utilization.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique specifically involves identifying the processes running on a system, which directly relates to gathering information on processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions behaviors that align with network sniffing (T1040) and implies further actions that could involve system and process discovery (T1082 and T1057).
   - Scanning for deleted files, while not directly listed in the provided TTPs, can be considered part of a broader discovery effort, potentially aligning with the goals of system information discovery (though it's more specifically related to T1005 - Data from Local System, which is not listed).
   - Given that Regin is known for its sophisticated and modular architecture, allowing it to perform a wide range of surveillance and intelligence gathering tasks, it's plausible that after initial network sniffing, it would proceed to gather more detailed information about the system and its processes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial behavior (network sniffing) and its alignment with T1040.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the subsequent actions described (gathering information on processes and memory utilization) and their potential alignment with T1082 and T1057.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of Regin engaging in these activities during its discovery phase, given its known capabilities and the provided TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Regin, after engaging in initial network monitoring and sniffing, would likely proceed to gather more detailed system and process information as part of its discovery phase.

Final Answer: A
