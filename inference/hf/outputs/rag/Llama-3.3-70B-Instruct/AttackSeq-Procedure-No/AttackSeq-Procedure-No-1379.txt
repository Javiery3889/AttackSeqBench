To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers use Arabic language decoy documents as part of a phishing strategy to gain initial access. After this initial access phase, it mentions the use of Scote malware to provide backdoor access. The malware allegedly collects Command and Control (C2) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves the use of malicious links to execute malicious code. It's part of the execution tactic, which is about executing malicious code on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is about using spearphishing with a link to gain initial access to a system. It's more targeted than regular phishing and is used to trick specific individuals into clicking on links that lead to malicious outcomes.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code through user interaction, such as clicking on a link or opening a malicious document.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial phase described in the question involves phishing with Arabic language decoy documents, which aligns with **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** as it involves using targeted phishing to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the use of Scote malware to collect C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles suggests a method of establishing persistence and possibly further executing malicious code. This could align with **T1204.001-Malicious Link** if the malware uses malicious links to communicate with its C2 servers or to download additional payloads.
   - **T1204-User Execution** is relevant in the context of how the initial phishing might have worked (e.g., users executing malicious code by opening documents or clicking links), but it's more about the initial execution of malicious code rather than the establishment of backdoor access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question essentially asks if it's plausible that after initial access via phishing, the Scote malware would provide backdoor access by collecting C2 information from specified sources.
   - Given the techniques mentioned, the scenario described is plausible because:
     - Initial access via phishing (potentially using **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**) could lead to the execution of the Scote malware.
     - The malware could then use **T1204.001-Malicious Link** to collect C2 information, establishing a backdoor.
   - Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence of events described could occur.

Final Answer: A
