To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker group, TG1021, has established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process. This allows NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality. The question then asks if it's likely that after establishing this backdoor, the attackers accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB (Server Message Block) using compromised domain credentials and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**: This is about moving from one system to another within a network to gain access to more sensitive data or systems.
   - **Technique: T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This involves using SMB to access Windows admin shares, which are network shares that allow administrators to access the file system, registry, and services of a remote computer. This technique is used for lateral movement.
   - **Technique: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves transferring tools or payloads from one system to another within a network, often to avoid detection and to maintain access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The scenario described involves establishing a backdoor (NodeIISWeb) for command and control, which is a common precursor to lateral movement.
   - The use of compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB aligns with the technique T1021.002, which is a method used for lateral movement.
   - Dropping a web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement also aligns with T1570, as it involves transferring a tool (in this case, a web shell loader) across the network for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Establishing a backdoor provides the attackers with a persistent presence in the network.
   - Using compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB is a logical next step for lateral movement, as it leverages existing network shares meant for administration.
   - Dropping a web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement is consistent with the tactics and techniques used by attackers to spread within a network without being detected.

Given the information and the related TTPs, it is logical to conclude that after establishing command and control, the attackers would use compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader for lateral movement. This sequence of actions aligns with known tactics and techniques for lateral movement within a compromised network.

**Final Answer: A**
