To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets before gaining initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers. This implies we are looking at the initial access phase of an attack.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access to a network. Exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability falls under this category.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's device by having them visit a malicious website that exploits a vulnerability in the user's browser or its plugins. Watering hole attacks, which involve compromising a website frequently visited by individuals from a specific organization or sector to infect their devices, also fall under this category.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers, which aligns with **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.
   - Watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits, as an alternative method, would align with **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.
   - The question essentially asks if the group (TG1021) is likely to have used a different initial access technique (watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits) than what is described (exploiting internet-facing applications).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that both techniques (T1190 and T1189) are viable for initial access but involve different approaches.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the question is about the likelihood of using one method over the other based on the context provided.
   - **Step 3**: Since the question specifies the use of deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability against Windows IIS servers, it implies a specific vector of attack that is different from watering hole attacks.
   - **Step 4**: Given that both methods (exploiting public-facing applications and drive-by compromise) are used for initial access and can involve zero-day exploits, the choice between them depends on the attackers' goals, the vulnerabilities available, and the targets' vulnerabilities.
   - **Conclusion**: Without specific information suggesting TG1021's preference for one method over the other in this context, and considering the question's phrasing, it seems to imply that the described action (exploiting IIS servers) is what actually happened, making the use of watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits as an alternative less likely in this specific scenario.

Final Answer: B
