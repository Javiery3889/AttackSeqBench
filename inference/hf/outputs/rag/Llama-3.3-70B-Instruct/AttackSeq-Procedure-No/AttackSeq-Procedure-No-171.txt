To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malware, SkinnyBoy, has communicated with its Command and Control (C2) server, updaterweb[.]com, to exfiltrate data. The question asks if, after this communication, SkinnyBoy is likely to collect specific system information (base64-encoded outputs from the systeminfo and tasklist commands along with enumerated directory content).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This indicates the use of standard encoding schemes (like base64) for communication between the malware and the C2 server. This technique is often used to hide or obscure the data being transmitted.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This refers to the act of transferring data from a compromised system to the attacker's system using the established C2 channel. This can include sensitive information about the system, network, or specific data of interest to the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that SkinnyBoy has already established communication with its C2 server and is using an HTTP POST request for data exfiltration, it suggests that the malware is capable of sending and receiving commands and data.
   - The use of base64 encoding (T1132.001) for systeminfo and tasklist command outputs, as well as directory content enumeration, fits within the context of collecting and preparing system information for exfiltration. This encoding would help in disguising the nature of the data being exfiltrated.
   - The technique of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel (T1041) directly supports the idea that after establishing communication, the next logical step for SkinnyBoy would be to collect and send system information back to the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the established communication between SkinnyBoy and its C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the use of standard encoding for data transmission.
   - **Step 3**: Understand the purpose of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.
   - **Step 4**: Connect the collection of system information (via systeminfo, tasklist, and directory enumeration) with the need to exfiltrate data.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is logical that after communicating with the C2 server, SkinnyBoy would proceed to collect and exfiltrate system information, which would likely include base64-encoded outputs from systeminfo and tasklist commands along with enumerated directory content.

Final Answer: A
