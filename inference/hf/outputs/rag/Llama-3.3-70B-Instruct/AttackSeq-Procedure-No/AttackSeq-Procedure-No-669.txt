To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, adversaries are likely to use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase. This involves understanding the context of both phases and the tools or techniques mentioned, such as DOCKERGEDDON, which is related to scanning and exploiting Docker APIs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This indicates that adversaries are scanning IP blocks, which could be part of their reconnaissance efforts to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding or disguising the infrastructure used for command and control, which might not directly relate to the reconnaissance phase but is relevant for understanding how adversaries might manage their resources and infrastructure.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This involves discovering containers and other resources, which could be relevant to identifying potential targets, such as Docker APIs, for exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, which suggests that adversaries are setting up or identifying infrastructure for their operations.
   - The use of DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase implies scanning for and potentially exploiting Docker APIs. This action aligns with the Discovery tactic, specifically the technique of container and resource discovery (T1613).
   - The related TTPs support the idea that adversaries engage in reconnaissance and discovery activities to identify vulnerable targets, such as Docker APIs, which could be exploited for further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address, indicating infrastructure setup or identification.
   - **Step 2**: The question implies a transition to the Reconnaissance phase, where adversaries would seek to gather more information about potential targets.
   - **Step 3**: The use of DOCKERGEDDON for scanning and potentially exploiting Docker APIs fits within the context of reconnaissance and discovery, aiming to identify vulnerable resources.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the related TTPs, it is plausible that after setting up infrastructure, adversaries would engage in reconnaissance activities, including scanning for vulnerable Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON.

Final Answer: A
