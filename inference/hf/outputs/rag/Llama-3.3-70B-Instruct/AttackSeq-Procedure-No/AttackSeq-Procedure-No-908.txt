To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon, a known threat actor, uses Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement by sending malicious emails to other targets. It then asks if, after this action, it is likely that the group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection**: This indicates that the threat actor is interested in collecting emails, which can be for various purposes such as gathering sensitive information, credentials, or for further social engineering attacks.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This shows the method used by Gamaredon for moving laterally within a network, which involves sending targeted phishing emails to other users within the same organization.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This specifies the collection of emails from local systems, which aligns with the interest in gathering email data from compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Gamaredon uses internal spearphishing for lateral movement, it indicates a level of sophistication and interest in accessing and manipulating email communications within an organization.
   - The techniques related to email collection (T1114 and T1114.001) suggest that collecting emails is a part of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - After gaining access to systems through lateral movement, collecting mail from those systems would be a logical next step for gathering intelligence, maintaining access, or preparing for further attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of Gamaredon's actions and the related TTPs.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the importance of email collection in the threat actor's TTPs.
   - **Step 3**: Connect the lateral movement technique with the potential for email collection as a follow-up action to maximize the benefit from compromised systems.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the emphasis on email as a vector for both lateral movement and collection, it is reasonable to conclude that after using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement, Gamaredon would indeed attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers.

Final Answer: A
