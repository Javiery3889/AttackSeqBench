To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Yellow Garuda, uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect various data from victims' Telegram accounts. It then asks if it's likely that the collected data are divided into fixed-size chunks to evade detection during exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics and Techniques (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, which is the act of transferring data from a system without authorization.
   - **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, which involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This technique is used to maintain stealth and control during data exfiltration.
   - **Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**, which involves limiting the size of data transfers to evade detection. This can include breaking up large files into smaller chunks to avoid triggering detection mechanisms that monitor for large data transfers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, dividing the collected data into fixed-size chunks (as described in T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits) is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection. This method makes it harder for security systems to identify the exfiltration of sensitive data, as smaller data transfers may not trigger the same level of scrutiny as larger, bulk transfers. The use of a C2 channel for exfiltration (T1041) also supports the idea that the attackers are taking steps to maintain stealth, which would include managing how data is transferred to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question implies that Yellow Garuda is taking steps to collect sensitive data from victims, indicating a level of sophistication in their attack methods.
   - The use of a 'grabber' tool for data collection suggests a targeted approach to gathering specific types of data.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques used for stealthy data exfiltration, including managing the size of data transfers to avoid detection.
   - Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that an attacker sophisticated enough to use specific tools for data collection would also take measures to ensure the exfiltration of that data is done in a way that minimizes the risk of detection, such as dividing the data into fixed-size chunks.

Final Answer: A
