To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Sunburst backdoor is delivered through a supply-chain attack, compromising SolarWinds, to achieve initial access. It then asks if it's likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for communication between the compromised system and the C2 server. Web protocols are commonly used for C2 communication due to their ubiquity and the ease with which such traffic can blend in with normal network activity.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This refers to the method used to gain initial access to a network by compromising the software supply chain, as seen in the SolarWinds attack. The Sunburst backdoor was delivered to targets through a software update, allowing the attackers to gain a foothold in the target networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks whether the communication with the C2 server (using a protocol like HTTP/HTTPS) happens before the initial access is achieved. Given the nature of the supply-chain attack and the delivery of the Sunburst backdoor, the backdoor's primary function is to establish a covert channel of communication with the C2 server after it has been installed on the target system. 
   - The initial access is achieved when the backdoor is successfully installed and executed on the target system, which is a result of the supply-chain compromise. The communication with the C2 server for command and control purposes would logically occur after the backdoor has been installed and is running on the compromised system, not before the initial access is achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Sunburst backdoor is delivered through a compromised software update.
   - The backdoor's installation and execution on the target system constitute the initial access.
   - Communication with the C2 server using web protocols (or any protocol) for command and control purposes would occur after the backdoor is installed and running, as this is when it can actually communicate back to the attackers.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved, as the backdoor needs to be installed and running (i.e., after initial access) to establish such communication.

Final Answer: B
