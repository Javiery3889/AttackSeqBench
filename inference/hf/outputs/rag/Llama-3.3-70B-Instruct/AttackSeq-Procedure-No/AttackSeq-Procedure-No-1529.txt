To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a script ('install.vbs') is scheduled for periodic execution, contributing to persistence. Then, it asks if another script ('stopedge.bat') is likely to delete certain files ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') as a means of defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This indicates the use of the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. It's related to how scripts or commands are run on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This involves deleting files to evade detection. An attacker might delete files used in an attack to cover their tracks or to prevent defenders from understanding the full scope of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action (scheduling 'install.vbs' for execution) is about persistence, ensuring the attacker's access to the system is maintained over time.
   - The question then shifts to whether 'stopedge.bat' would delete specific files as a means of defense evasion. Given that defense evasion often involves hiding or removing evidence of an attack, and considering the technique of file deletion (T1070.004) is mentioned, it's plausible that an attacker would delete files used in their attack to avoid detection.
   - The use of the Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) could be relevant for executing the 'stopedge.bat' script, which in turn could be responsible for deleting files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already taken steps to ensure persistence, indicating a desire to maintain access to the system.
   - **Step 2**: The attacker is considering using 'stopedge.bat' for file deletion, which aligns with defense evasion tactics.
   - **Step 3**: The related TTPs support the idea that an attacker would use command shell execution for various tasks, including potentially deleting files to evade defense mechanisms.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of persistence and the tactics of defense evasion through file deletion, it is reasonable to conclude that 'stopedge.bat' could indeed be used to delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
