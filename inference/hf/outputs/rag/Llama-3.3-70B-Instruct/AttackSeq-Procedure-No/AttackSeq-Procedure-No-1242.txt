To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about the behavior of APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, after collecting data. Specifically, it asks whether APT28 would divide files if they exceed a certain size (0x1000000 bytes or more) during the exfiltration process, targeting specific sectors like political figures and the aerospace industry.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates that the threat actor uses automated methods to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. Automated exfiltration can involve various techniques, including the use of crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to a Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves setting limits on the size of data transfers. This could be relevant to the question as it directly pertains to how data is handled based on its size during exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context of APT28's operations and the specific TTPs mentioned, the question essentially asks whether APT28 would employ a tactic to manage large files (0x1000000 bytes or more) by dividing them, facilitating easier exfiltration without detection.
   - The technique T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits suggests that threat actors might indeed consider the size of the data they are exfiltrating and take measures to manage it, such as dividing large files, to avoid detection or to comply with the limitations of their exfiltration method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understanding APT28's goal to exfiltrate data without detection, and their use of automated exfiltration methods.
   - **Step 2**: Recognizing the relevance of data transfer size limits in the exfiltration process, which could necessitate dividing large files.
   - **Step 3**: Considering the targeting of political figures and the aerospace industry, which might involve handling large amounts of sensitive data, making file division a plausible tactic for efficient and stealthy exfiltration.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that APT28 would indeed divide files if they exceed a certain size to facilitate their exfiltration goals, especially when targeting high-value information from political figures and the aerospace industry.

Final Answer: A
