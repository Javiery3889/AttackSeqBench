To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing persistence within a target network, it's likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, specifically those related to lateral movement and internal spearphishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network to gain access to more sensitive data or systems. It's a common step after initial access has been gained and persistence has been established.
   - **Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using social engineering tactics to trick users within the network into performing certain actions that aid the attacker. This could include clicking on links, opening attachments, or executing files that the attacker has placed in a shared location.
   - **Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique specifically refers to the act of moving tools or payloads from one system to another within a network, often to avoid detection or to utilize existing trust between systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions employing internal spearphishing techniques as part of the attack sequence. Internal spearphishing (T1534) can be used to trick users into executing malicious files or transferring tools to other parts of the network.
   - Lateral tool transfer (T1570) is a technique that directly involves moving tools across the network, which could be facilitated by internal spearphishing if the tools are transferred to a network share that the targeted users have access to.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Establishing persistence within a target network is a precursor to further malicious activities, including lateral movement.
   - **Step 2**: Lateral movement can involve transferring tools to other systems within the network to expand access and control.
   - **Step 3**: Internal spearphishing can be an effective method to trick users into executing these transfers, especially if the tools are placed in a shared location.
   - **Step 4**: Given the tactics and techniques involved, it is plausible that after establishing persistence, an attacker would use internal spearphishing to facilitate the lateral movement of tools by transferring files to a network share.

**Final Answer: A**
