To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that FIN13, presumably a threat actor or group, would first retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager (which falls under the tactic of Credential Access) before gathering information on network and host configurations (which falls under the tactic of Discovery) using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system, which could include network settings, firewall rules, and connected devices.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores**: This involves accessing cloud-based secrets management services to obtain sensitive information such as credentials, which could be used for further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This involves exploring the file system of a compromised host to gather information about the system's structure, configuration, and potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if retrieving secrets (Credential Access) would precede gathering network and host configuration information (Discovery) in an attack sequence.
   - Typically, in an attack sequence, an adversary might first attempt to gather information about the network and host configurations to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities. This reconnaissance phase (using techniques like T1016 and T1083) often precedes attempts to access sensitive information like credentials stored in cloud secrets management stores (T1555.006), as knowing the environment helps in identifying where and how to look for valuable secrets.
   - However, the specific actions of a threat actor can vary based on their goals, the information they already possess, and the vulnerabilities they've identified. If a threat actor already has a way to access the AWS Secrets Manager, they might indeed retrieve secrets first, which could then be used to facilitate further discovery and exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the tactics and techniques involved. The question involves Credential Access and Discovery tactics.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the typical sequence of actions in an attack. Usually, discovery precedes credential access as it helps in identifying potential targets.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the specific scenario. If FIN13 has a direct method to access AWS Secrets Manager, it might use this as an initial step to gain an advantage.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the likelihood based on the provided TTPs. Given the information, it seems plausible that FIN13 could retrieve secrets first if they have a viable method to do so, as this could significantly aid in subsequent discovery and exploitation efforts.

**Final Answer: A**
