To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial Access Method**: Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities. This indicates that the attackers are using vulnerabilities in software to gain access, which aligns with the tactic of exploiting vulnerabilities for execution.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution." This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code. The mention of client execution suggests that exploiting client software vulnerabilities is a plausible method for achieving execution.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that exploiting client software vulnerabilities (like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158) could be a likely method for execution after initial access. Given the context of exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access and the related TTP focusing on exploitation for client execution, this seems plausible.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that exploiting client software vulnerabilities would not be a likely method for execution in this scenario. However, the information provided does not strongly support this conclusion, especially considering the attackers' initial method of exploiting vulnerabilities and the relevance of T1203.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis of the related TTPs, it seems more likely that after gaining initial access through exploiting vulnerabilities, the attackers would continue to exploit client software vulnerabilities for execution. This approach aligns with the observed tactics and techniques, particularly the focus on exploiting vulnerabilities for client execution.

Final Answer: A
