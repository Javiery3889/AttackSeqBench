To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by Earth Lusca, starting with exploiting remote services for lateral movement within a network. It then asks if, after this initial step, Earth Lusca would likely target user credentials using specific tools (procdump and Mimikatz) only after scanning the network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to two main tactics:
   - **Lateral Movement (Tactic)**: This involves moving through a network after gaining initial access, often to gain greater access or control. The technique mentioned is **T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.
   - **Credential Access (Tactic)**: This involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. The technique mentioned is **T1003.001 - LSASS Memory**, which involves obtaining credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. Tools like procdump and Mimikatz are commonly used for this purpose.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of exploiting remote services for lateral movement (T1210) sets the stage for further actions within the network.
   - Scanning the network environment (using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan) would logically follow as a means to identify potential targets for further exploitation or to gather information on the network layout and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Targeting user credentials (using tools like procdump and Mimikatz) after scanning would be a plausible next step, as having credentials can facilitate deeper access and control within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Earth Lusca exploits remote services for lateral movement, which is a common initial step for spreading within a network.
   - **Step 2**: Scanning the network environment to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities is a logical next step to understand the network layout and plan further actions.
   - **Step 3**: Targeting user credentials after scanning would provide Earth Lusca with the means to access more systems, data, or services, aligning with the tactics of lateral movement and credential access.
   
Given the logical progression from exploiting remote services, to scanning the network, and then targeting credentials for deeper access, the sequence described in the question aligns with common attack patterns.

**Final Answer: A**
