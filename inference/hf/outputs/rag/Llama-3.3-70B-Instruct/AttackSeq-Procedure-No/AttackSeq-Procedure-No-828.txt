To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably GreyEnergy, uses spearphishing emails and exploits public-facing web servers to gain initial access to a system. After gaining access, the question asks if it is likely that the attacker would inject shellcode into svchost.exe and then run some modules fileless in memory. This behavior is aimed at hindering analysis and detection.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This TTP is about exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain initial access. The question mentions compromising public-facing web servers, which aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: Process injection is a technique used to inject code into running processes to evade detection and possibly escalate privileges. Injecting shellcode into svchost.exe, as mentioned in the question, is a form of process injection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This further supports the use of process injection for evading defenses, which aligns with running modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario that starts with initial access (via spearphishing and exploiting public-facing applications) and then moves towards actions that could be classified under privilege escalation and defense evasion, specifically through process injection.
   - The related TTPs provide context that supports the use of process injection for both escalating privileges and evading defenses, which matches the actions described in the question (injecting shellcode into svchost.exe and running modules fileless in memory).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gains initial access through spearphishing and exploiting public-facing web servers, which aligns with the provided TTPs.
   - **Step 2**: The actions described (injecting shellcode into svchost.exe and running modules fileless in memory) are consistent with the techniques of process injection for both privilege escalation and defense evasion.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access, an attacker like GreyEnergy would likely use such tactics to maintain access and evade detection.
   
**Final Answer: A**
