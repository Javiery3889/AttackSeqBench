To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, referred to as "Dropping Elephant," has evaded defenses and is executing PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. The question then asks if this backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** with **Technique: T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers**. This technique involves obtaining credentials from web browsers, which could include cookies.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** with **Technique: T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie**. This technique specifically involves stealing web session cookies, which are used to authenticate users to websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the backdoor's ability to evade defenses and download additional malware, indicating a sophisticated level of access and capability.
   - The related TTPs (T1555.003 and T1539) are both under the "Credential Access" tactic, which aligns with the goal of stealing browser cookies for the purpose of accessing user credentials or sessions.
   - Stealing browser cookies (especially session cookies) would be a logical next step for an attacker looking to gain unauthorized access to the victim's online accounts or sessions, given the backdoor's demonstrated capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Dropping Elephant backdoor has demonstrated the ability to evade defenses and execute PowerShell scripts, indicating a level of sophistication and intent to compromise the system further.
   - **Step 2**: The related TTPs (T1555.003 and T1539) directly relate to stealing credentials from web browsers and session cookies, respectively, which aligns with the potential actions of a sophisticated backdoor.
   - **Step 3**: Given the backdoor's capabilities and the relevance of the TTPs to credential access, it is plausible that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would attempt to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies as part of its operation.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis of the related TTPs, the most likely answer is that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is indeed capable and likely to steal browser cookies.

Final Answer: A
