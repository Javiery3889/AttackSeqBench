To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether threat actors, after gaining valid credentials for system access, will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms only after they have escalated their privileges to gain administrative control over the target network. This implies a sequence of actions: gaining access, escalating privileges, and then attempting to bypass detection mechanisms.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Privilege Escalation. Specifically:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** indicates the goal of increasing the level of access or authority within a system.
   - **Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** and **Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts** both involve using valid accounts (either domain accounts or other valid accounts) to escalate privileges. This suggests that the threat actors are using legitimate access methods to move laterally or gain higher levels of access within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question implies a specific sequence of events: access, privilege escalation, and then evasion (bypassing detection mechanisms).
   - The related TTPs focus on the use of valid accounts for privilege escalation, which aligns with the initial part of the sequence (access and escalating privileges).
   - However, bypassing detection mechanisms (evasion) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided TTPs but is a common step after gaining higher privileges to maintain access and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Threat actors first need to gain access, which they do by acquiring valid credentials.
   - Next, they escalate their privileges to gain more control, which is directly supported by the TTPs provided (T1078.002 and T1078).
   - After escalating privileges, it is logical that they would attempt to bypass detection mechanisms to avoid being caught and to maintain their access. This step, while not directly mentioned in the TTPs, is a common practice in the attack sequence.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question (access, escalate privileges, and then bypass detection) is a plausible sequence of actions for threat actors.

**Final Answer: A**
