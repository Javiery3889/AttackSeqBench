To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that FamousSparrow, presumably an adversary group, would use a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The sequence in question involves stealing application access tokens via phishing emails with malicious links, followed by collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase. The question essentially inquires about the plausibility of this sequence in the context of FamousSparrow's operations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include a tactic (Initial Access) and a technique (T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link). This technique is a method used by adversaries to gain initial access to a system or network by sending spearphishing emails that contain malicious links. The fact that this technique is highlighted suggests that FamousSparrow is known to use spearphishing as a means of initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the technique T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) is associated with FamousSparrow, it's reasonable to infer that they could use phishing emails with malicious links as a method for initial access. Stealing application access tokens could be a subsequent action after gaining initial access, as it would provide them with the necessary credentials to move laterally within the network or access specific applications. Collecting system information and probing files are actions typically associated with the Discovery phase (as mentioned in the question), which follows initial access in the attack lifecycle. This sequence aligns with common adversary tactics, where after gaining access, the next steps would involve reconnaissance to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information that could be used for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - **Step 1**: FamousSparrow uses spearphishing links for initial access, which aligns with the provided TTP.
    - **Step 2**: The use of phishing emails with malicious links to steal application access tokens is a plausible next step after initial access, as it would facilitate further movement within the targeted network.
    - **Step 3**: Collecting system information and probing files are standard actions during the Discovery phase, which logically follows initial access and aligns with the tactics of understanding the environment to plan subsequent attacks.
    - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the logical sequence of attack phases (Initial Access followed by Discovery), it is plausible that FamousSparrow would engage in the described sequence of actions.

Final Answer: A
