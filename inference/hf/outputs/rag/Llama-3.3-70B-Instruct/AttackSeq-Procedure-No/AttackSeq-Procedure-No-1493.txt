To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether it's likely that Charming Kitten, presumably a threat actor, first created phishing websites to steal credentials by impersonating Instagram and Google, and then used impersonation of well-known researchers or journalists to send socially engineered emails for gaining initial access to targets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This suggests the threat actor uses spearphishing targeted at specific services, which could include impersonating services like Instagram and Google to gather information or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This indicates the use of spearphishing with a link to gain initial access. This could involve sending links to phishing websites impersonating legitimate services.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation**: This involves impersonating someone or something else to evade defenses, which could include impersonating well-known researchers or journalists to build trust with the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The sequence described in the question involves an initial phase of credential theft through phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google, followed by a phase of impersonating well-known individuals to send socially engineered emails. 
   - The related TTPs support the use of spearphishing targeted at services (which could include creating phishing websites for credential theft) and the use of impersonation for defense evasion (which aligns with impersonating researchers or journalists).
   - The initial phase (credential theft via phishing) could be seen as part of the reconnaissance or initial access tactics, setting the stage for further actions like targeted spearphishing.
   - The second phase (impersonating well-known individuals) directly aligns with the impersonation technique for defense evasion, aiming to trick targets into letting their guard down.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the tactics and techniques that align with the initial phase of the attack (phishing for credential theft).
   - **Step 2**: Recognize how these initial actions could facilitate or be followed by the impersonation of well-known individuals for further social engineering.
   - **Step 3**: Consider how these actions fit within the context of the provided TTPs, specifically the use of spearphishing and impersonation.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment of the described actions with the provided TTPs and the logical progression from initial credential theft to more targeted social engineering, it is plausible that Charming Kitten engaged in such a sequence of activities.

Final Answer: A
