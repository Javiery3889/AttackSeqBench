To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically the Sednit group, has already gained execution on a victim's machine using a Delphi downloader. This downloader utilizes the Windows API to execute commands and has sent gathered system information to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question then asks if the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader would perform system service discovery to obtain information about services on the victim's machine.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, **Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to gather information about system services running on the victim's machine. This could include services such as Windows services, network services, or other system-level processes.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which could include hardware, software, configuration, and other system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the Sednit group has already sent system information to the C&C server, the next logical step in the attack sequence, especially considering the use of an AutoIt downloader (which is known for its ability to download and execute additional payloads), would be to gather more specific information about the system services. This is because understanding what services are running can help the attacker identify potential vulnerabilities, understand the system's configuration, and plan further actions such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Sednit group has already demonstrated an interest in gathering system information.
   - The use of an AutoIt downloader suggests the capability to download and execute additional tools or payloads.
   - System service discovery (T1007) is a logical next step after initial system information discovery (T1082) to gather more detailed insights into the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Sednit group would use the AutoIt downloader to perform system service discovery to further understand the victim's machine and plan subsequent actions.

Final Answer: A
