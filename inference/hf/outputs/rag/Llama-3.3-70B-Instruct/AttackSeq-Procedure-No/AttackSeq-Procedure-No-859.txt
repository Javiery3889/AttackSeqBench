To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor program has established communication with a Command and Control (C2) server using DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling is a technique used by attackers to bypass security controls by encapsulating malicious data within DNS queries. The question asks whether, after establishing this communication, the backdoor program is likely to parse the returned data to extract commands from the C2 server before gathering host information during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTP provided is Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004 - DNS. This indicates that the attackers are using DNS for command and control purposes, which aligns with the scenario described in the question. The use of DNS tunneling for C2 communications suggests that the attackers are attempting to hide their communications within legitimate DNS traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Understanding the Purpose of C2 Communications**: The primary purpose of establishing a C2 channel is for the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system and receive data back. This includes receiving instructions on what actions to perform next, such as gathering host information.
    - **Parsing Returned Data for Commands**: After establishing communication, it is logical that the backdoor program would need to parse any returned data to understand what actions the C2 server is instructing it to perform. This could include commands to gather specific host information.
    - **Gathering Host Information**: Gathering host information is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker seeks to understand the environment, network, and system they have compromised. This information is crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - The backdoor program establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.
    - The purpose of this communication is for the C2 server to issue commands and for the backdoor to receive these commands.
    - Before proceeding with specific actions like gathering host information, the backdoor program must understand what it is being instructed to do.
    - Therefore, it is logical that the backdoor program would parse the returned data to extract commands from the C2 server.
    - Only after understanding these commands would the backdoor proceed with actions such as gathering host information, as these actions would be guided by the received commands.

**Final Answer: A**
