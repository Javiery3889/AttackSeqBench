To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether SideCopy, presumably a threat actor or malware, is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems, specifically in the context of targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This suggests that the threat actor is interested in bypassing or compromising multi-factor authentication mechanisms, which aligns with the targeting of Kavach, an MFA app.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This indicates a method used by the threat actor to maintain persistence on a compromised system by loading malicious DLLs.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This shows that the threat actor uses DLL side-loading not just for persistence but also as a means to evade detection, suggesting a sophisticated approach to remaining undetected on victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs suggests an initial infection vector that could be used to gain initial access to a system. 
   - The techniques mentioned (DLL side-loading for persistence and defense evasion, and targeting multi-factor authentication) imply that after initial access, the threat actor focuses on establishing a foothold and evading detection, which would logically follow the initial infection.
   - Given that the question asks if these infection chains are executed "only after establishing initial access," we must consider if the described activities (involving malicious files and DLLs) are part of the initial access phase or subsequent phases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that initial access typically involves gaining an initial foothold into a system or network.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the use of malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs can be part of establishing this initial access, as they can be used to deliver malware that compromises a system.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the tactics and techniques provided, which suggest a focus on persistence and defense evasion post-initial access, but also acknowledge that the initial infection vector (malicious files and DLLs) is indeed a method to gain access.
   - **Step 4**: Determine that the question's phrasing implies a sequence where initial access is a prerequisite for the described infection chains, which aligns with typical attack patterns where initial access is gained before further malicious activities are conducted.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence is that SideCopy would indeed execute these infection chains after establishing initial access, as the activities described (use of malicious files and DLLs for infection) are consistent with methods used to gain initial access to systems before moving on to persistence, credential access, and defense evasion tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
