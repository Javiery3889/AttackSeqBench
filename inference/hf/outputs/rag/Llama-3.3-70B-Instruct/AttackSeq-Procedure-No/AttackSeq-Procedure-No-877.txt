To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands **only before** the Discovery tactic, given that they have used the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic to gather system and network information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control (C2) communications. It implies that attackers use these protocols to send and receive data, including commands and collected information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This is about gathering information about the system, which aligns with the use of the Aria-body backdoor for gathering detailed system and network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifies the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications **only before** the Discovery tactic. However, the provided TTPs suggest that these protocols can be used for C2 purposes, which would logically include both before and after (or during) the Discovery phase, as the attackers would need to maintain communication to receive the collected data and send further commands.
   - The use of the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic implies an ongoing process of information gathering and potentially sending this information back, which would align with using HTTP and TCP protocols during or after the Discovery phase, not strictly before it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Naikon APT group's use of the Aria-body backdoor for system and network information gathering during the Discovery tactic suggests an active engagement phase where they would likely maintain command and control communications.
   - The specified use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for commands is consistent with the Command and Control tactic, which would be necessary during or after the Discovery phase to utilize the gathered information effectively.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Naikon APT group would use these protocols **only before** the Discovery tactic, as the Discovery phase itself would require ongoing communication for the backdoor to be effective.

Final Answer: B
