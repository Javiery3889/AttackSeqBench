To answer this question, let's break down the steps as requested:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system. It then asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process before executing a dropper to enable system compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the initial access tactic, specifically techniques involving phishing (T1566) and more precisely, spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001). These techniques are indeed methods used by threat actors, including APT28, to gain initial access to a target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **Understanding APT28's Modus Operandi**: APT28 is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks. The use of spear phishing with malicious attachments aligns with their known tactics for initial access.
    - **Use of Geographically Distributed Bots**: The use of geographically distributed bots (often referred to as a botnet) to report back to a central server is a common tactic for command and control (C2) communications. This method can help in evading detection by distributing the C2 traffic across multiple IPs and geographies, making it harder to block.
    - **Discovery Process and Dropper Execution**: After initial access, the next steps typically involve some form of discovery to understand the network layout, identify valuable targets, and then execute additional payloads (like a dropper) to establish a foothold and enable further compromise.

Given these points, the question essentially asks if APT28 would use a botnet for C2 communications during the discovery phase before deploying additional malware (a dropper) for system compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - APT28 is known for sophisticated attacks, and using spear phishing with attachments for initial access is consistent with their tactics.
    - The use of geographically distributed bots for C2 communications during the discovery phase is plausible as it aligns with tactics used by advanced threat groups to maintain stealth and flexibility.
    - Executing a dropper to enable system compromise after initial access and discovery is a common next step in the attack chain.

Considering these points, the scenario described in the question aligns with known tactics and techniques used by APT28 and other sophisticated threat actors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that APT28 could indeed use such a method as part of their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
