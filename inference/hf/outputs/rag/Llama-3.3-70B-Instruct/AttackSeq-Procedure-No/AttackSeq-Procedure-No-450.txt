To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Agrius, gains initial access to a system by exploiting public-facing applications using vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379. It then asks if Agrius is likely to use "pass the ticket" for lateral movement before communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates the initial stage of the attack involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access. This matches the initial action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This suggests that the attacker uses web protocols (like HTTP) for communication with C2 servers, which aligns with the latter part of the question regarding communication over HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of actions: initial access via exploiting public-facing applications, followed by lateral movement using "pass the ticket," and then communication with C2 servers.
   - "Pass the ticket" is a technique (T1095) under the Lateral Movement tactic, which involves using a ticket to access a system without needing the password. This technique is plausible for lateral movement after initial access has been gained.
   - The use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP for C2 communication fits with the T1071.001 technique, indicating that after gaining access and possibly moving laterally, the attacker would use web protocols for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access is gained through exploiting public-facing applications, which is a known TTP.
   - **Step 2**: For lateral movement, using "pass the ticket" is a viable method once inside the network, especially if the attacker has obtained sufficient credentials or access.
   - **Step 3**: Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP using a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' aligns with using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - Given the logical progression from initial access, to lateral movement, to C2 communication, and considering the provided TTPs, the sequence described in the question seems plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
