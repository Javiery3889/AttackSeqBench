To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a Command and Control (C2) connection has been established through malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script execution. It then asks if it's likely that adversaries would perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT (Remote Access Trojan) to target systems after this initial step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This indicates the use of malicious files to execute code on a system. Malicious VBA scripts fall under this category as they can be used to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute code. While related to execution, it's not directly mentioned in the question but is relevant to understanding the execution tactics used by adversaries.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing with attachments to gain initial access to a system. This is a common method for delivering malware, including RATs like BlackEnergy 3, to target systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the establishment of a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution, which aligns with the **Execution** tactics (T1204.002).
   - The delivery of a RAT like BlackEnergy 3 often requires initial access to the target system. Given that a C2 connection is already established, the question is whether a phishing campaign (specifically, spearphishing with an attachment, T1566.001) would be a likely next step to deliver the RAT.
   - Phishing campaigns, especially spearphishing, are common initial access vectors for delivering malware. However, the question implies that some level of access (via the C2 connection) has already been achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The establishment of a C2 connection suggests that the adversaries have already gained some level of access to the system.
   - Delivering a RAT like BlackEnergy 3 could be a next step to expand control or capabilities within the compromised system or network.
   - However, the question asks about performing a phishing campaign **after** establishing a C2 connection. Given that phishing is typically used for initial access, and some access has already been gained, it might seem less likely as a next step for delivering the RAT to the **same** systems where the C2 connection has been established.
   - Nevertheless, phishing could still be used to expand the scope of the attack to other systems or users within the same organization that are not yet compromised.

Considering these points, the answer to whether it is likely that adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT **after** establishing a C2 connection is not straightforward. However, given the context that phishing is a common method for delivering malware and the goal of expanding access or control, it's plausible that phishing could be used, either to target additional systems or to ensure persistence and increased control.

**Final Answer: A**
