To answer this question, let's break down the steps as outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if, after collecting email messages, an adversary is likely to identify privileged users during the discovery phase using the PsLogList tool. This involves understanding the context of the discovery phase in an attack sequence and how tools like PsLogList might be used.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the discovery phase. 
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery** involves discovering the system time, which could be useful for synchronizing actions or understanding the system's configuration but doesn't directly relate to identifying users.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** involves techniques used to identify the owners or users of a system, which directly relates to identifying privileged users.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions collecting email messages, which could provide information about users, including potentially privileged ones. However, the specific use of the PsLogList tool in this context needs to be considered. PsLogList is a tool that can be used to list logon sessions, which could indeed help in identifying users, including privileged ones, by analyzing logon events.
   - Given that T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) is a technique aimed at discovering system owners or users, and considering that identifying privileged users is a key part of the discovery phase for an adversary, using a tool like PsLogList aligns with this tactic. It can help in listing logon sessions, thereby aiding in the discovery of users, including those with elevated privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understanding the context of the discovery phase and the goal of identifying privileged users.
   - **Step 2**: Recognizing the relevance of T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) to the task of identifying users.
   - **Step 3**: Considering how a tool like PsLogList could be used to list logon sessions and thereby aid in user discovery.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information and the context provided, it is plausible that an adversary would use the PsLogList tool as part of their discovery activities to identify privileged users after collecting email messages.

Final Answer: A
