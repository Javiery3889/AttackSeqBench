To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul malware exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2017-9841) in PHPUnit systems to gain initial access. Following this, it queries whether the malware would likely use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services and then periodically download a bash script named 'cron' for persistence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is used for initial access, which aligns with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain access to the system.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using legitimate credentials to access systems or services, which could include logging into external remote services.
   - **T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs for persistence, which aligns with the periodic downloading of a bash script named 'cron'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 fits the **Initial Access** tactic via **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.
   - The use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services aligns with the **Persistence** tactic via **T1078-Valid Accounts**. This is plausible as an action following initial access, especially if the goal is to expand access or utilize existing credentials for further malicious activities.
   - The periodic downloading of a bash script named 'cron' directly aligns with **T1053.003-Cron** under the **Persistence** tactic, indicating an attempt to maintain access to the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Tuyul malware gains initial access through exploiting a public-facing application vulnerability.
   - It then leverages legitimate credentials (possibly obtained during initial access or already available) to access external remote services, which is a common tactic to expand the scope of access or control.
   - Finally, to maintain persistence, it utilizes cron jobs by downloading a bash script named 'cron', which is a technique used to ensure continued access to the system without needing constant manual intervention.

Given the logical sequence of exploiting a vulnerability for initial access, using valid accounts for further access, and employing cron jobs for persistence, the scenario described in the question aligns well with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware like Tuyul.

**Final Answer: A**
