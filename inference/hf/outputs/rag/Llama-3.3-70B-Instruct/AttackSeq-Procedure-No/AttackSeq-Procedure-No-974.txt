To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses DLL side-loading for defense evasion to execute an encrypted payload. It then asks if it's likely that the final payload will use secondary C2 (Command and Control) servers before connecting back to the primary C2 server at a specified IP address and port.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple, potentially disparate, communication channels to obscure the command and control channel. This could include using secondary C2 servers as intermediaries.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection, which is relevant to the use of port 9999 (a non-standard port) for C2 communication.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is used for defense evasion, where a legitimate DLL is side-loaded with a malicious one to execute malicious code, which is mentioned in the question as the initial step.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** suggests that an attacker might use secondary C2 servers as part of their communication strategy to obscure the primary C2 channel.
   - The mention of **T1571-Non-Standard Port** indicates that the attacker is already employing evasion techniques, including the use of non-standard ports for communication, which supports the idea of using indirect or secondary channels.
   - The initial use of **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** for defense evasion shows the attacker's intent to avoid detection, which aligns with using complex communication channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker starts by using DLL side-loading, indicating a desire to evade detection.
   - The use of multi-stage channels (T1104) is a common technique to further obscure the C2 communication, making it harder to detect and track the attack.
   - The employment of non-standard ports (T1571) for the final C2 communication adds another layer of evasion.
   - Given these evasion techniques, it's reasonable to assume the attacker would also use secondary C2 servers to further complicate the communication chain before connecting to the primary C2 server.

**Final Answer: A**
