To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the provided Related TTPs.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where recipients are first presented with a document that appears to be a legitimate blog post or report. Following this, they receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF (Rich Text Format) documents. These RTF documents exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2017-8759, but mentioned as CVE-2017-8750 in the question, which seems to be a typo) to deliver QuasarRAT (a type of remote access trojan). The question asks if it's likely that recipients will receive these spear phishing emails only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. The exploitation of CVE-2017-8759 (the correct CVE related to the described exploit) for QuasarRAT delivery fits this technique, as it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (likely Microsoft Office, given the RTF document context) to execute the QuasarRAT malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves using spear phishing with an attachment to gain initial access to a system. The scenario described in the question, where recipients receive spear phishing emails with malicious RTF documents, aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if the spear phishing emails are a consequence of a previous QuasarRAT infection. However, based on the Related TTPs and the typical attack flow, spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (like the RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8759) are usually an initial access vector. They are used to deliver malware (in this case, QuasarRAT) to the victim's system, not as a result of the system already being infected.
   - The correct sequence typically involves the attacker sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access (T1566.001), which then leads to the exploitation of a client application (T1203) to execute the malware (QuasarRAT).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The described attack sequence starts with presenting recipients with a document (which might be part of the social engineering aspect to make the subsequent spear phishing more believable) and then involves sending spear phishing emails with RTF documents that exploit a vulnerability for QuasarRAT delivery.
   - Given the Related TTPs, the spear phishing emails are an initial access tactic, not a consequence of the system already being infected with QuasarRAT.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that recipients will receive these spear phishing emails only after getting infected with QuasarRAT, as the spear phishing is the initial vector for delivering the QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: B
