To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines an attack sequence that starts with the deployment of worms to scan for and exploit misconfigured hosts, specifically targeting exposed Docker API ports for initial access. After gaining access, the attackers aim to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts using command interpreters, with the ultimate goal of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This TTP involves using malicious images (in this context, likely Docker images) to execute malicious code. This technique can be used to gain execution capabilities on a system, potentially leading to further malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1496.001-Compute Resource Hijacking**: This TTP is about hijacking the compute resources of a system, which aligns with the objective of using compromised systems for cryptocurrency mining, a resource-intensive activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if the execution of cryptocurrency mining scripts (which would be a part of the resource hijacking objective) occurs only after achieving the ultimate goal of resource hijacking. However, the execution of such scripts is actually a means to achieve the resource hijacking, not a step that occurs after it.
   - The use of malicious container images (T1204.003) can be a method to initially compromise a system or to maintain access and execute further malicious code, including cryptocurrency mining scripts.
   - The ultimate goal of resource hijacking (T1496.001) is achieved through the execution of these scripts, which consume system resources for cryptocurrency mining.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers' objective is to hijack resources, and executing cryptocurrency mining scripts is a direct method to achieve this.
   - The use of command interpreters to execute these scripts is a step in the process of achieving resource hijacking, not a step that occurs after it.
   - Therefore, the correct sequence involves using malicious means (like malicious images) to gain access and execute scripts that lead to resource hijacking, not waiting until after the hijacking has been achieved.

**Final Answer: B**
