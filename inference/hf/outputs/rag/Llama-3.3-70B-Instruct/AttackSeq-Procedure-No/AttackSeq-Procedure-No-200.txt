To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably the GreyEnergy group, has compromised a computer and is using tools like Nmap (for network mapping) and Mimikatz (for credential collection). The question then asks if the group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker (a type of ransomware) and other tools across the network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This involves the attacker mapping the network to understand its layout and identify potential targets. Tools like Nmap are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves moving tools and payloads laterally within a network, often to expand the attacker's control and prepare for further actions like deploying ransomware.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This involves using software deployment tools to execute payloads on remote systems. PDQ Deploy is a tool that can be used for legitimate software deployment but can also be exploited by attackers for malicious purposes, such as deploying ransomware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of Nmap and Mimikatz aligns with the initial stages of an attack, particularly with the Discovery tactic (T1018) and potentially preparing for Lateral Movement.
   - The question of using PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network directly relates to Lateral Movement (T1570) and using Software Deployment Tools (T1072) for execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have already compromised a system and are in the process of mapping the network and collecting credentials, which is consistent with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Step 2**: The next logical step for the attackers, after understanding the network layout and gaining necessary credentials, would be to move laterally within the network to expand their control and prepare for further malicious activities.
   - **Step 3**: Using a tool like PDQ Deploy for deploying software (in this case, AvosLocker and other malicious tools) across the network fits within the Lateral Movement and Execution tactics, specifically leveraging Software Deployment Tools.

Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is plausible that the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy or similar tools to facilitate the movement of AvosLocker and other tools across the network as part of their lateral movement and execution tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
