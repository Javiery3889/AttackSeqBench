To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after conducting network reconnaissance, uses tainted shared content on network shares for lateral movement and then employs a backdoor for command and control. The specific techniques and tools mentioned (tainting shared content, using a backdoor) are part of a larger attack sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to lateral movement. Specifically:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement** indicates the attacker's goal is to move through the network.
   - **Technique: T1080 - Taint Shared Content** involves modifying shared content to include malicious components, which can be used for lateral movement.
   - **Technique: T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares** refers to using Windows admin shares (a feature of the Server Message Block protocol) to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions using tainted shared content for lateral movement, which aligns with **T1080 - Taint Shared Content**.
   - The use of a backdoor (HyperBro) for command and control after lateral movement is a plausible next step in an attack sequence, as it would allow the attacker to maintain access and issue commands.
   - The mention of network reconnaissance at the beginning fits into the broader context of an attack, where understanding the network layout and vulnerabilities is crucial before attempting lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker conducts network reconnaissance to identify vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 2**: The attacker uses tainted shared content (aligning with T1080) as a method for lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: After successfully moving laterally, the attacker employs a backdoor (HyperBro) for command and control, a common step to maintain access.
   - Given the provided TTPs and the logical progression of an attack, the scenario described in the question is plausible and aligns with known tactics and techniques used by attackers like Emissary Panda.

Final Answer: A
