To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks whether, after exfiltrating data, the Sayad malware is likely to capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host. This implies a sequence of actions: data exfiltration, then possibly discovery, and finally screenshot capture.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data, which could be part of the exfiltration process or a step to organize collected data for further use.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a method of collecting data directly from the user's screen.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence where data exfiltration has already occurred. The next steps in question are whether the malware would perform discovery (collecting system and application details) before capturing screenshots.
   - **Discovery** is a tactic that involves gathering information about the compromised system or network. While not explicitly listed as a related TTP, it's a common step in the attack sequence to understand the environment before deciding what data to collect next.
   - Capturing screenshots (T1113) is a direct method of collecting sensitive information and can be performed at various stages of an attack, depending on the attacker's goals.
   - The sequence of performing discovery before capturing screenshots makes logical sense because understanding the system and applications (discovery) could help in identifying what screenshots would be valuable to capture.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has already exfiltrated data, indicating it has reached a point where it is collecting and sending data back to the attackers.
   - The next logical step in a sophisticated attack would be to gather more specific information about the system (discovery) to maximize the value of subsequent data collection efforts.
   - Capturing screenshots (T1113) as part of the collection tactic aligns with the goal of gathering more specific, potentially sensitive information from the compromised host.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would proceed with capturing screenshots after performing discovery, as this would allow it to target its data collection efforts more effectively.

Final Answer: A
