To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 (Command and Control) server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method. This is after it has used SparrowDoor for communication with the C&C server over HTTPS and for encrypted communications using multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration** - This is the overall goal of stealing data from a network.
   - **Technique: T1029 - Scheduled Transfer** - This involves transferring data in a scheduled manner, which could align with the "every 10 minutes" timeframe mentioned in the question.
   - **Technique: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique involves using the same channel used for command and control to exfiltrate data, which could be relevant given the context of communication with a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifies the use of SparrowDoor for communication and encryption, indicating a level of sophistication in the attack that could support scheduled data transfers.
   - The mention of exfiltrating data "every 10 minutes" strongly suggests a scheduled approach, which aligns with **T1029 - Scheduled Transfer**.
   - The use of the C2 channel for both command and control and potentially for exfiltration (**T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**) is also consistent with the scenario described, as it involves utilizing established communication channels for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question - scheduled data exfiltration, use of SparrowDoor, communication over HTTPS, and encryption with multi-byte XOR keys.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze the related TTPs to understand the tactics and techniques involved, specifically focusing on exfiltration methods.
   - **Step 3**: Match the details of the question with the TTPs, noting that scheduled transfer (T1029) and exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) both support the scenario described.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the specifics about scheduled exfiltration and the use of established C2 channels for communication and potentially exfiltration, it is reasonable to conclude that FamousSparrow could indeed exfiltrate data in the manner described.

Final Answer: A
