To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with reconnaissance activities. These activities include gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods. The question then asks if it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gather information about the target environment. The techniques listed under this tactic are:
     - **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker scanning for open ports and services on remote systems to gather information about the environment.
     - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is used to discover the network connections of a system, which can help in understanding the network topology and identifying potential targets.
     - **T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This involves checking for user activity to determine if and how a system is being used, which can help in planning a more targeted attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions reconnaissance activities followed by the installation of a malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) through employee-enabled macro execution. The establishment of communication with C2 servers is a critical step for the operation of such malware, as it allows the attackers to issue commands and receive stolen data.
   - The related TTPs focus on discovery, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase mentioned in the question. However, the question's focus is on whether the communication with C2 servers happens before the implant is installed.
   - Typically, malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 are designed to establish communication with C2 servers after they have been installed on the target network. This communication is necessary for the malware to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads.
   - Employee-enabled macro execution is a method used to install malware on a system. After the malware is installed, it would then establish communication with C2 servers, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The reconnaissance activities (gathering information and active discovery) are indeed initial steps in an attack sequence.
   - The installation of malware like BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution is a method of gaining access to a network.
   - The establishment of communication with C2 servers is a post-installation step for the malware to operate effectively.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that a malicious implant would establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network.

Final Answer: B
