To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the provided Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via weaponized RTF documents to drop a downloader. This aligns with **T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution**, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

2. **Establishing Command and Control (C2)**: The question mentions the establishment of C2 using a custom TCP protocol. This is relevant to **T1071.001 - Web Protocols** under the Command and Control tactic, although it specifically mentions web protocols, the concept of using a custom protocol for C2 is closely related. Moreover, **T1571 - Non-Standard Port** is directly relevant as it involves using unusual ports for C2 communication, which can include custom TCP protocols on non-standard ports.

3. **Execution and Downloading Additional Malware**: The execution of the MSIL/Crimson malware and the attempt to download the full RAT (Remote Access Trojan) component from a specified IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001) further supports the use of non-standard ports for C2, as indicated by T1571.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the tactics and techniques outlined in the Related TTPs:
- **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)** for initial access.
- **Non-Standard Port (T1571)** and the broader context of **Command and Control** tactics for establishing and maintaining communication.
- The use of a custom protocol, while not a direct match for **Web Protocols (T1071.001)**, fits within the context of establishing command and control, especially when considering the use of non-standard ports.

Therefore, the scenario described in the question, involving the exploitation of a vulnerability for initial access, the establishment of command and control using a custom protocol on a non-standard port, and the execution of malware to download additional components, is plausible and aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries.

Final Answer: A
