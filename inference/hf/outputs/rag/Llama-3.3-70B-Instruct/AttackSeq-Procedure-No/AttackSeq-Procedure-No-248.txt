To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after gathering system information (such as Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, and Proxy Server) from an infected machine, is considering communicating between compromised hosts and their command-and-control (C2) servers. The method of communication in question is via HTTP POST requests, and the action includes uploading encoded system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates the tactic of exfiltrating data from a compromised system back to the attacker's C2 server. The technique specifically mentions using the C2 channel for exfiltration, which aligns with the idea of sending gathered system information back to the attacker.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This tactic and technique are about discovering information about the system, which is what the initial gathering of system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, etc.) is about.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attacker has already gathered system information (aligning with T1082-System Information Discovery), the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this information back to the C2 server. 
   - The use of HTTP POST requests for communication between compromised hosts and C2 servers is a common method for exfiltrating data, as it can be used to send data to a server for collection, which aligns with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - Uploading encoded system information via HTTP POST requests is a plausible method for exfiltrating the gathered data, as encoding the data can help avoid detection by security systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker gathers system information, which matches the Discovery tactic and the System Information Discovery technique.
   - **Step 2**: The attacker needs to exfiltrate this information, which matches the Exfiltration tactic and the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
   - **Step 3**: Using HTTP POST requests for this exfiltration is a common and effective method, especially when the data is encoded to avoid detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is likely that NanHaiShu would communicate between compromised hosts and their C2 servers via HTTP POST requests to upload the encoded system information.

Final Answer: A
