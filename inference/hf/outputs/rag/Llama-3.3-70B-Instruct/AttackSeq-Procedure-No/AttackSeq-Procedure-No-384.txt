To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, specifically APT15, has used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. The question then asks if it is likely that APT15 would retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager before deploying specific backdoors.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**: This is the overarching goal of the attacker, which involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services.
   - **Technique: T1003.004 - LSA Secrets**: This involves accessing Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can include credentials. Mimikatz is a tool often used for this purpose.
   - **Technique: T1555.006 - Cloud Secrets Management Stores**: This technique involves accessing cloud-based secrets management services, such as AWS Secrets Manager, to obtain sensitive information like credentials or encryption keys.
   - **Technique: T1555.004 - Windows Credential Manager**: This technique involves exploiting the Windows Credential Manager to obtain stored credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials aligns with **T1003.004 - LSA Secrets**.
   - The question mentions retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager, which directly aligns with **T1555.006 - Cloud Secrets Management Stores**.
   - Deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution suggests a phase of establishing persistence and possibly lateral movement, which can be facilitated by the credentials and secrets obtained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT15 has already demonstrated the capability to obtain domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, indicating a focus on credential access.
   - The group's interest in retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager would logically follow as an extension of their credential access efforts, especially if they aim to access cloud resources or use those secrets for further malicious activities.
   - The deployment of backdoors suggests a desire to maintain access and potentially use the compromised system as a pivot point for further attacks, which could be facilitated by the secrets and credentials obtained from both on-premises systems and cloud services.

Given the logical progression from obtaining domain administrator credentials to potentially accessing cloud-based secrets for further exploitation, and considering the tactics and techniques provided, it seems plausible that APT15 would indeed attempt to retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager as part of their attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
