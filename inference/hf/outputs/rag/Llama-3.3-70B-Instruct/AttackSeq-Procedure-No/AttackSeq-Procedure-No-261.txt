To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious documents with embedded macros download the Dridex loader. It then inquires about the likelihood of the loader using RC4 encryption for string obfuscation to evade detection and executing the OutputDebugStringW function as an anti-debugging technique.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Defense Evasion. Specifically:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** indicates the attacker's goal is to evade detection by the defenses of the target system.
   - **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** suggests the process of decoding or deobfuscating files or information that has been previously obfuscated, which could be part of the loader's behavior to execute its payload.
   - **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** refers to the use of obfuscation to make files or information less detectable, which aligns with using encryption like RC4 to hide strings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings is a method to hide the loader's intentions and evade detection, fitting the Defense Evasion tactic and specifically aligning with Technique T1027.
   - The execution of the OutputDebugStringW function as part of anti-debugging techniques is a method to detect if the malware is being debugged, which also aligns with Defense Evasion tactics, though it's not directly mentioned in the provided TTPs, it's a known technique used by malware to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The question outlines a specific scenario involving the download of the Dridex loader through malicious documents, which is a known method for distributing malware.
   - **Step 2**: The use of RC4 encryption for obfuscating strings is a plausible step for malware aiming to evade detection, aligning with the provided TTPs related to Defense Evasion.
   - **Step 3**: The execution of the OutputDebugStringW function as an anti-debugging technique further supports the notion that the malware is employing multiple evasion techniques.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the loader would employ such techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
