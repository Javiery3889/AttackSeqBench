To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents. This action is attributed to Gamaredon's malware. The question asks whether, after this action, the malware is likely to search for sensitive documents before moving laterally via compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content (like documents) to include malicious code, which can then be executed when other users access these documents. This is relevant to the action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection**: This involves injecting malicious code into document templates to evade detection. While related to document manipulation, it's more about evasion than the action of searching for sensitive documents.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. It's an initial access method and not directly related to the actions after gaining access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The action described (injecting malicious macros into documents) aligns with **T1080-Taint Shared Content**, which is under the Lateral Movement tactic but also involves modifying shared content to spread malware.
   - The question implies that after injecting malicious macros, the next step would be to search for sensitive documents before moving laterally. However, the provided TTPs do not explicitly mention searching for sensitive documents as a necessary step before lateral movement.
   - **T1221-Template Injection** is about defense evasion through template injection, which doesn't directly imply searching for sensitive documents.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is about initial access and doesn't directly relate to post-compromise actions like searching for documents or lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question's scenario involves injecting malicious code into documents, which could be part of a larger campaign to compromise systems and potentially move laterally.
   - The TTPs provided suggest that the malware is capable of modifying shared content (T1080) and evading defenses (T1221), but they do not explicitly state that searching for sensitive documents is a prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - Given the context, it seems unlikely that the malware's primary next step, as described, would be to search for sensitive documents **only** before lateral movement, as the actions described (injecting macros) are more about spreading the malware and potentially gaining further access rather than specifically targeting sensitive information as a necessary precursor to lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
