To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether the Sednit group, after gaining initial access through email attachments with malicious VBA macros, is likely to use Scheduled Tasks via a Group Policy Object (GPO) to execute malware at a predetermined time. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that the Sednit group might employ.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification**: This indicates that the attackers have the capability to modify Group Policy Objects, which can be used to configure and manage various aspects of the Windows environment, including the execution of tasks.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This shows that the attackers can use Scheduled Tasks for executing malicious code or programs at specific times or intervals, which aligns with the goal of executing malware at a predetermined time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Sednit group's initial access method via email attachments with malicious VBA macros suggests they are capable of sophisticated attacks.
   - The ability to modify Group Policy Objects (as indicated by T1484.001) would allow them to configure systems to execute tasks, including malware, at specific times using Scheduled Tasks (T1053.005).
   - Leveraging Scheduled Tasks through a GPO for malware execution fits within the tactics of both Privilege Escalation (to ensure persistence and control) and Execution (to achieve the goal of running malicious code).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Sednit group gains initial access, which is a common first step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Step 2**: They have the capability to escalate privileges, which could involve modifying Group Policy Objects.
   - **Step 3**: With the ability to modify GPOs, they can configure Scheduled Tasks for execution at specific times.
   - **Step 4**: Executing malware through Scheduled Tasks aligns with their goal of maintaining access and control over the compromised system.
   - Given these steps and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the Sednit group could leverage Scheduled Tasks via a GPO to execute malware at a predetermined time after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: A
