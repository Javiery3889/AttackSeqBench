To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the NewPass implant uses a loader library to decode a configuration file and evade detection. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Encrypted POST requests could be a method used for this purpose, as they can be part of a C2 communication protocol.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection, which aligns with the initial action of the NewPass implant decoding its configuration file.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data using unencrypted, non-C2 protocols. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an example of such a protocol, but it's specified as unencrypted, which contrasts with the encrypted POST requests mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial action of decoding a configuration file for evasion (T1140) is followed by the question of how the malware proceeds with exfiltration.
   - The use of encrypted POST requests for exfiltration aligns with T1041, indicating a preference for encrypted C2 channels for data exfiltration.
   - Initiating a download via FTP (an unencrypted protocol) before exfiltrating via encrypted POST requests seems inconsistent with the tactics typically employed for stealthy and secure data exfiltration. T1048.003 mentions exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols, but the question's context suggests a focus on encrypted methods for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The NewPass implant's initial action of decoding its configuration file is a defense evasion technique.
   - The subsequent actions regarding exfiltration are the focus of the question.
   - Given the emphasis on encrypted POST requests for exfiltration (aligning with T1041), and considering typical malware behaviors aiming for secure and stealthy operations, initiating a download via an unencrypted protocol like FTP before using encrypted POST requests seems less likely as a preferred sequence for a malware aiming to maintain stealth and security in its operations.
   - Therefore, based on the provided TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence does not typically involve using FTP before encrypted POST requests for exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
