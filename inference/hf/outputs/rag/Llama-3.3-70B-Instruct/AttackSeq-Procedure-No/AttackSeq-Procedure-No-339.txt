To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Nemesis bootkit, which evades detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads. This implies the bootkit operates at a pre-OS boot level, bypassing typical operating system integrity checks. The question then asks if, after evading detection in this manner, the Nemesis bootkit will achieve persistence solely by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR) afterward.

2. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**: This indicates that the persistence tactic involves techniques that occur before the operating system boots, which aligns with how bootkits like Nemesis operate.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**: This shows that bootkits are used to evade defenses, specifically by operating at the pre-OS boot level, which is a method to bypass traditional security controls.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit**: This further clarifies that bootkits are not only used for defense evasion but also for achieving persistence. The technique involves modifying boot components, which can include the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR), to ensure the malware loads every time the system boots.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **Answer Choice A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that after evading detection, the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence solely by infecting the VBR. Given the techniques associated with bootkits (T1542.003-Bootkit), it's plausible that infecting the VBR could be a method of achieving persistence. However, the question's phrasing ("will it achieve persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR) only afterward") implies exclusivity to VBR infection for persistence, which might not fully capture the range of persistence methods a bootkit could employ.
   - **Answer Choice B (No)**: This choice implies that the bootkit might achieve persistence through means other than, or in addition to, infecting the VBR. Given the broad capabilities of bootkits to modify boot processes and the fact that persistence can be achieved through various means (not limited to VBR infection), this seems like a more comprehensive understanding of how a bootkit like Nemesis could operate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Nemesis bootkit operates at the pre-OS boot level, evading typical detection methods.
   - Bootkits are known to achieve persistence through modifying boot components, which can include the VBR.
   - However, the exclusivity implied by "only afterward" and "infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR)" might not fully represent the range of persistence techniques available to a bootkit.
   - Considering the tactics and techniques provided, it's reasonable to conclude that while VBR infection could be a method of persistence, it might not be the only method used by the Nemesis bootkit.

Final Answer: B
