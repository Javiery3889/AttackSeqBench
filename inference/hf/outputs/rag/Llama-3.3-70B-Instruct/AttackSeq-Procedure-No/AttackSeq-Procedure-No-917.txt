To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after using a backdoor for discovery (specifically, to list interesting files like Office documents), it queries whether Gamaredon's malware would then scan all drives (including network shared drives) for sensitive data before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This indicates that the adversary is interested in collecting data from network shared drives, which aligns with scanning network shared drives for sensitive data.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This suggests that the adversary is engaged in discovering files and directories, which could include listing interesting files such as Office documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a backdoor for discovery (listing interesting files) followed by scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data fits within the context of the Collection tactic (T1039) and the Discovery tactic (T1083).
   - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence is a plausible next step after discovering and collecting sensitive data, as it would allow the adversary to maintain access to the compromised system and potentially spread laterally within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial action of using a backdoor to list interesting files aligns with the Discovery tactic, specifically T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
   - **Step 2**: The subsequent action of scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data aligns with the Collection tactic, specifically T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive.
   - **Step 3**: Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence is a logical step after collecting sensitive data, as it enables further malicious activities.
   - Given the context provided by the Related TTPs and the logical progression of tactics (from Discovery to Collection and then to persistence mechanisms), it is reasonable to conclude that after discovering interesting files, the malware would indeed scan for sensitive data before taking further actions like inserting malicious macros.

**Final Answer: A**
