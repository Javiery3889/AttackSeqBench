To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of actions attributed to Tropic Trooper, a known threat actor group. The actions include:
   - Exploiting Equation Editor to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
   - Dropping RegAsm.exe onto systems for malicious activity.
   - Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is focused on "Defense Evasion" with a specific technique of "Dynamic-link Library Injection" (T1055.001). This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Exploiting Equation Editor** is a known initial access technique that can lead to various malicious activities, including the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Dropping RegAsm.exe** could be part of the attack for registering malicious assemblies or components, which might be necessary for the subsequent steps of the attack, including defense evasion techniques.
   - **Injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe** directly aligns with the "Dynamic-link Library Injection" technique (T1055.001) under the "Defense Evasion" tactic. This action is plausible as it allows the attackers to hide their malicious code within a legitimate process, making it harder for security software to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial exploitation and execution of malicious payloads set the stage for further malicious activity.
   - The use of RegAsm.exe could be a preparatory step for the injection of the malicious DLL, ensuring that the necessary components are registered and ready for use.
   - The injection of a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe is a technique that aligns with the provided TTP, indicating an attempt to evade defense mechanisms by blending malicious activity with legitimate system processes.

Given the context and the TTPs involved, the sequence of actions described in the question seems plausible for a threat actor like Tropic Trooper aiming to establish a covert presence within a compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
