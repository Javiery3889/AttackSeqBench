To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably PKPLUG, uses legitimate signed applications to evade defenses and deliver malicious payloads. The delivery method mentioned involves spear-phishing emails that exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications. The question then asks if, after this initial delivery, PKPLUG is likely to achieve persistence solely through DLL side-loading.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTP provided is T1574.002, which refers to DLL side-loading. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, typically by placing the malicious DLL in a location where the legitimate application will load it. This can be used for persistence, among other goals, as it allows the malicious code to run under the context of a trusted process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Initial Delivery**: The use of spear-phishing emails to exploit Microsoft Office vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment, T1204 - User Execution). This method can successfully deliver a payload to a victim's system.
    - **Evading Defenses**: Using legitimate signed applications to launch malicious payloads is a technique to evade defenses, possibly referring to T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) or similar techniques that leverage trusted processes to execute malicious code.
    - **Persistence via DLL Side-Loading**: After the initial compromise, achieving persistence is a key goal for attackers. DLL side-loading (T1574.002) is a technique that can be used for persistence by ensuring the malicious code is loaded every time the legitimate application is run.

Given the context, the question essentially asks if DLL side-loading is a plausible method for achieving persistence after the initial delivery and execution of the payload. 

- **DLL side-loading** can indeed be used for persistence, as it allows malicious code to be executed every time a legitimate application is launched, without the need for continuous exploitation of the initial vulnerability.
- The scenario described (delivery via spear-phishing and exploitation of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, followed by evasion techniques) is a common pattern in cyber attacks, and using DLL side-loading for persistence aligns with known tactics used by various threat actors.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The initial delivery method (spear-phishing exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities) is plausible and common.
    - The use of legitimate signed applications to evade defenses is also a known tactic.
    - DLL side-loading is a recognized technique for achieving persistence.
    - Given the context, it is reasonable to conclude that after delivering a payload and evading defenses, an attacker like PKPLUG could indeed use DLL side-loading as a method to achieve persistence on a compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
