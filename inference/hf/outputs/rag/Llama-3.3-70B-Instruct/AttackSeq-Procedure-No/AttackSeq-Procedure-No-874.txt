To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained initial access to a system by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows. The attacker then escalates privileges using specific CVEs (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956). After these steps, the question asks whether it's likely that the Stager module would encode its Command and Control (C2) traffic using Base64 before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This TTP involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access. The scenario described fits this technique, as it involves exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome (a public-facing application) and Microsoft Windows.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This TTP involves using standard encoding schemes (like Base64) to encode C2 communications. This makes the communication less suspicious and helps evade detection by security systems that do not decode or inspect encoded traffic.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This TTP is about exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, which aligns with the use of CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 for privilege escalation in the scenario.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario starts with initial access through exploitation (T1190), followed by privilege escalation (T1068), which are both described in the question.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of the Stager module encoding its C2 traffic using Base64 (T1132.001) before further actions. Encoding C2 traffic is a common technique used by attackers to hide their communications from security monitoring tools. Given that the attacker has already demonstrated sophistication by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and using specific CVEs for privilege escalation, it's reasonable to assume they would also use standard encoding techniques to hide their C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker gains initial access through exploiting public-facing applications (Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows).
   - The attacker escalates privileges using specific CVEs, indicating a level of sophistication.
   - To maintain stealth, encoding C2 traffic using standard encoding (like Base64) is a common practice among attackers.
   - Therefore, given the context and the TTPs involved, it is plausible that the Stager module would encode its C2 traffic using Base64 before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

Final Answer: A
