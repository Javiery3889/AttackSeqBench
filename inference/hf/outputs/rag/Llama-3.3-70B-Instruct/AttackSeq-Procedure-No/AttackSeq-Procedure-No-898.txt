To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about the likelihood of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack occurring during the Impact phase, immediately after data exfiltration, as opposed to deploying RYUK ransomware a week later. The context involves an attack sequence where data has already been exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client, indicating the attacker has already gained access to the network and has begun the Collection phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all categorized under the "Impact" tactic, which is the final stage of the MITRE ATT&CK framework where the adversary attempts to disrupt or destroy systems and data. The techniques mentioned include:
   - **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This involves encrypting data to disrupt access or render it useless, which aligns with the deployment of ransomware like RYUK.
   - **T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique involves disrupting network services, which could be achieved through a DDoS attack.
   - **T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**: Similar to network denial of service but focused on endpoints, making them unavailable for use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context that data has been exfiltrated and considering the techniques under the Impact tactic, both DDoS (T1498) and ransomware deployment (T1486) are plausible actions for the Impact phase. However, the question is about the likelihood of a DDoS attack happening immediately after data exfiltration instead of deploying ransomware a week later.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already exfiltrated data, which suggests they have achieved part of their objectives.
   - Deploying ransomware like RYUK is a common method to monetize access to a network by encrypting data and demanding payment for the decryption key.
   - A DDoS attack, on the other hand, could serve to further disrupt the victim's operations or could be used as a smokescreen for other malicious activities.
   - Given that ransomware deployment is mentioned as a future action (a week later), it suggests a planned sequence of events where the immediate focus might not be on causing widespread disruption through a DDoS but rather setting the stage for ransom demands.
   - However, the use of DDoS as an immediate follow-up to data exfiltration could be a tactic to apply additional pressure or create a diversion, but it doesn't necessarily align with the typical sequence of ransomware attacks where the focus is on encrypting data and then demanding ransom.

**Final Answer: B**
