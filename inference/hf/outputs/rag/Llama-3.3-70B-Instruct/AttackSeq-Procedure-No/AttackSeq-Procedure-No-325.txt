To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app, after collecting a list of processes for discovery, potentially hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7 devices. This action is considered after the app sends the gathered information, including processes data, to a Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the use of automated techniques to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. Sending gathered information to a C2 server via HTTP fits this description, as it involves the automatic transfer of data from the victim's device to the attackers' server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This involves the collection of information about running processes on a system. The XAgent app's action of collecting a list of processes aligns with this technique, as it is used for discovering and potentially exploiting the system's current state.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where the XAgent app first collects process information (Discovery), then sends this information to the C2 server (Exfiltration), and finally, it is suggested that the app hides its icon and runs in the background.
   - The provided TTPs support the initial actions (process discovery and data exfiltration) as part of a plausible attack sequence.
   - Hiding the app's icon and running in the background could be part of evasion techniques (not explicitly listed among the provided TTPs but relevant to maintaining persistence and stealth).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The XAgent app collects process information, which aligns with T1057-Process Discovery.
   - **Step 2**: The app sends the collected information to the C2 server via HTTP, fitting T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
   - **Step 3**: After exfiltrating the data, for the app to remain stealthy and continue its operations without detection, it would logically attempt to hide its presence by hiding its icon and running in the background, especially if it's designed to operate on a specific platform like iOS 7.
   - Given the context and the TTPs provided, the sequence described in the question seems plausible as it combines discovery, exfiltration, and potential evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
