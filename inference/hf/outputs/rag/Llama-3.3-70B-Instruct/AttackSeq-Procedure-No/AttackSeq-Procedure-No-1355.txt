To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SideWinder APT group uses an exploit (CVE-2019-2215) to gain initial access to devices through malicious apps on Google Play. It then asks if it's likely that the group would use techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before exploiting other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU) from a Command and Control (C&C) server to root devices for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates the use of exploits against publicly facing applications to gain initial access. The use of CVE-2019-2215 to exploit malicious apps on Google Play fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**, **Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges on a system. The mention of using exploits like CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU to root devices aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access is gained through exploiting a public-facing application (malicious apps on Google Play), which matches the first TTP.
   - To evade detection and successfully exploit further vulnerabilities for privilege escalation, using techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation would be plausible. These techniques help in hiding malicious activities from security software and making the detection of the malware more difficult.
   - The exploitation of vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU) for privilege escalation matches the second TTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The SideWinder APT group gains initial access via exploiting public-facing applications, which is a known TTP.
   - **Step 2**: To maintain access and evade detection, employing evasion techniques is a common practice among APT groups.
   - **Step 3**: The use of exploits for privilege escalation is consistent with the provided TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is likely that the SideWinder APT group would employ techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before using exploits for privilege escalation.

Final Answer: A
