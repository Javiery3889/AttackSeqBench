To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the provided Related TTPs.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions that an adversary, Earth Lusca, might take to gain access to a network and then move malware or tools across it. The steps include gathering network configurations and domain information, using spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites for initial access, and then using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The Related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This indicates the use of software deployment tools to deploy malware or tools within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This refers to the use of spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes an initial step of gathering network information, which isn't directly mentioned in the Related TTPs but is a common precursor to using software deployment tools effectively.
   - The use of spear phishing emails with malicious links (T1566.002) is directly mentioned as a method for initial access, aligning with one of the options described in the question for achieving initial access.
   - The deployment of malware or tools using software deployment tools (T1072) is also mentioned, which aligns with the latter part of the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access**: The question mentions using spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites. The Related TTPs specifically mention spear phishing link (T1566.002) as a technique for initial access, supporting this part of the question.
   - **Gathering Information**: While not directly mentioned in the Related TTPs, gathering network configurations and domain information is a plausible step before using software deployment tools to ensure the adversary understands the network layout and can effectively deploy malware or tools.
   - **Using Software Deployment Tools**: The question and the Related TTPs (T1072) both mention the use of software deployment tools, indicating this is a likely step after initial access has been achieved.

Given the information provided and the alignment of the question's steps with the Related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
