To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described order of events based on the provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and the context of the attack.

1. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)**: The attackers started by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute malicious code on the client's system. This is a common initial access technique where attackers use vulnerabilities in software to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Use of PowerShell (T1059.001)**: After gaining initial access, the attackers used PowerShell to execute the Empire stager. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including executing malicious scripts and payloads. The Empire stager is a part of the Empire framework, which is a post-exploitation framework used for establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and executing further malicious actions on a compromised system.

Given these steps, the question asks if it's likely that the attackers acquired domains for command and control (C2) servers and developed malicious components, including the Graphite malware, only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

**Analysis**:
- The exploitation of a vulnerability for client execution (T1203) and the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) for executing the Empire stager are initial steps in establishing a foothold within a network.
- Acquiring domains for C2 servers and developing or deploying additional malware like Graphite would typically follow the initial compromise, as these actions are part of establishing command and control and potentially moving laterally within the network or maintaining persistence.

**Likelihood of the Sequence**:
Given the nature of the TTPs involved, it is plausible that the attackers would first establish a foothold in the network through exploitation and initial execution of malicious code (like the Empire stager via PowerShell). The subsequent actions of acquiring C2 domains and developing/deploying additional malware would logically follow as the attackers seek to consolidate their access, gather intelligence, and potentially move towards their ultimate objectives (which could include data exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious activities).

**Conclusion**:
Based on the provided TTPs and the typical flow of a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the acquisition of domains for C2 servers and the development or deployment of additional malicious components like the Graphite malware could indeed occur after the initial exploitation and execution of the Empire stager via PowerShell.

**Final Answer: A**
