To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if it's likely that after a malware uses HTTPS for command and control (C2) operations, it would then discover system information and process lists using a specific command. This implies we're looking at the behavior of malware post-establishment of C2, focusing on its potential actions to gather more information about the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This is about the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or environment they are operating in. It's a common post-compromise tactic aimed at understanding the layout, defenses, and potential targets within the compromised environment.
   - **Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the system, which could include details like the operating system version, architecture, and other system-specific details. The command 'systeminfo' is a direct way to achieve this on Windows systems.
   - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique is used by the adversary to gather information about running processes on the system. This could help in identifying potential security software, running applications that might be targeted, or processes that could be hijacked or used for further malicious activities. The command 'tasklist' is commonly used for this purpose.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the malware has already established a C2 channel using HTTPS, it indicates the malware is operational and likely looking to expand its control or gather more information about the system.
   - The use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' directly aligns with the techniques T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery), which are both under the Discovery tactic. This command would provide the malware with a list of running processes and detailed system information, respectively.
   - The context of using HTTPS for C2 suggests the malware is capable of executing commands on the compromised system, which supports the plausibility of it executing a command like 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to gather more information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has established a C2 channel, indicating it can execute commands on the system.
   - The techniques T1057 and T1082 are directly related to the actions the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' would perform.
   - The use of such a command would be a logical next step for an adversary looking to understand the system better after establishing C2.
