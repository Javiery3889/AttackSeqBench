To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether an attack likely evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations before initiating by sending a PDF attachment that appeared benign. This implies a sequence of actions where the attacker first uses a seemingly harmless method (like sending a PDF) to gain initial access, and then utilizes legitimate tools to avoid detection during the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Defense Evasion and Technique: T1036-Masquerading. 
   - **Defense Evasion** is a tactic used by attackers to avoid being detected by security controls and monitoring. 
   - **T1036-Masquerading** refers to the technique of disguising malicious activity or files as legitimate processes or tools to avoid detection. This can include using legitimate system tools or files to carry out malicious activities, making it harder for defenders to distinguish between legitimate and malicious actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate the answer choices.
   - **A: Yes** suggests that the attack did indeed evade detection by first sending a benign-appearing PDF (which could be a phishing attempt or contain a malicious payload) and then using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations. This aligns with the concept of masquerading (T1036) as part of a defense evasion tactic, where the attacker blends malicious activities with legitimate ones to avoid detection.
   - **B: No** implies that the attack did not evade detection through these means, which contradicts the information provided about the use of legitimate tools and a benign-appearing initial vector (the PDF attachment).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with a potentially malicious PDF attachment that is designed to appear benign, aiming to bypass security filters.
   - The use of legitimate tools and scripts for the attack's operations after the initial phase is a clear indicator of the masquerading technique (T1036), which is a method of defense evasion.
   - Given the tactic of defense evasion and the specific technique of masquerading, it is reasonable to conclude that the attack was designed to evade detection by blending in with normal system activity.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, as described, aligns with answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
