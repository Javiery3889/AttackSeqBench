To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question discusses a scenario where FireEye observed the use of single-byte XOR keys for encoding configuration files by DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) C2 (Command and Control) servers. It then asks whether, after completing various wiping processes, it is likely that attackers rebooted the target system instead of proceeding with DDOS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, which led to a significant disruption of Next Media's network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File**: This TTP indicates that attackers are using encryption or encoding to evade detection. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files falls under this category, as it's a method to hide or obscure the content of these files from security tools and analysts.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service**: This TTP is about causing a denial of service at the endpoint level, which could result from various actions, including wiping processes that lead to system crashes or reboots, or direct DDOS attacks that overwhelm a system, making it unavailable.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question contrasts two possible actions after the wiping processes were complete: rebooting the target system versus launching DDOS attacks. 
   - The use of encoded configuration files (T1027.013) suggests an attempt to evade detection, which is a common precursor to more disruptive actions like data wiping or DDOS attacks.
   - The mention of "various wiping processes" implies that the attackers were engaged in activities aimed at causing damage or disruption to the target systems, which aligns with the Impact tactic, particularly T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers' use of encoded files and engagement in wiping processes indicates a pattern of behavior focused on evading detection and causing impact.
   - Given the context of a campaign that includes DDOS C2 servers and the goal of promoting disruption (as evidenced by targeting websites related to democracy in Hong Kong), it's reasonable to infer that the primary objective was to cause significant disruption.
   - Rebooting the target system after wiping could be part of the disruption process, especially if the wiping was designed to cause system failure or data loss. However, the question's framing suggests a choice between rebooting and launching DDOS attacks, with the latter being more directly aligned with the described campaign's objectives and the observed TTPs.

**Final Answer: B**
