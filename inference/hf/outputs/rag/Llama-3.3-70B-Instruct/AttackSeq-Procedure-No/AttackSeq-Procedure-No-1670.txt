To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after performing discovery activities, the TDrop2 malware is considered for its potential use of Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications. Specifically, it mentions the use of encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet for communicating with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (like base64) to hide or obscure data in command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding schemes, which could include customizing standard encoding methods (like using a custom base64 alphabet), to hide or obscure data in command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication channels that allow for both sending and receiving data between the malware and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of a custom base64 alphabet for encoding commands, which aligns with **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** because it involves modifying the standard base64 encoding scheme.
   - The use of Google Drive for C2 and the communication with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands (with a custom alphabet) suggests a level of complexity and customization in the communication method, which is plausible given the techniques mentioned.
   - **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** supports the idea of communicating with C2 servers, as it implies a two-way communication channel, which is necessary for sending commands and receiving data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The TDrop2 malware's use of custom encoding (custom base64 alphabet) for C2 communications matches the description of **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**.
   - The scenario involves bidirectional communication with C2 servers, which is consistent with **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**.
   - Given the context and the techniques described, it is plausible that TDrop2 malware could use Google Drive as part of its C2 infrastructure before communicating with C2 servers using the described methods.

**Final Answer: A**
