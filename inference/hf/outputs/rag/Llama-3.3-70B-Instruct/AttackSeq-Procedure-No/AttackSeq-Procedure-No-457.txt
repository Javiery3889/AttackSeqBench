To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by attackers. First, they target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection. Then, it asks if it's likely that attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware or malicious activity to evade detection. Using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files could be a method of masquerading, as it might make the malicious files appear less suspicious or evade detection by traditional security software.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email to gain initial access to a system. The use of impersonated documents, especially when combined with exploiting vulnerabilities like the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files, fits within the realm of spearphishing with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where attackers first engage in activities that could be considered reconnaissance or preparation (targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents). 
   - Then, it mentions the use of simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion. This action suggests an attempt to avoid detection, possibly as part of an initial intrusion or during the exploitation phase.
   - Finally, it questions the likelihood of exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access after the mentioned defense evasion tactic.

Given the tactics and techniques provided:
- **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading)** could indeed be used in conjunction with exploiting vulnerabilities for **Initial Access**. 
- The use of **spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001)** is a common method for initial access, and exploiting vulnerabilities in files (like HWP files exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability) could be part of this technique.

However, the question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence and limitation ("only after" and "for initial access only"), which might not always align with the fluid and adaptive nature of real-world attacks. Attackers might use these techniques in various combinations and at different stages of their operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the tactics and techniques mentioned and their potential roles in an attack sequence.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that defense evasion techniques can be used at multiple stages of an attack, not just after initial access.
   - **Step 3**: Acknowledge that initial access techniques, such as spearphishing with malicious attachments, can involve exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 4**: Consider the likelihood of the specific sequence described, given the adaptability of attackers and the potential for these techniques to be used in various contexts.

Given the information and the nature of cyber attacks, it's plausible that attackers could use these techniques in the described sequence as part of a more complex operation. However, the question's constraints ("only after" and "for initial access only") might not fully capture the variability of real-world attack sequences.

**Final Answer: A**
