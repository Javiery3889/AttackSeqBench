To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group uses the Responder tool for credential harvesting during the credential access phase. It then inquires whether the group would likely collect password policy information before achieving lateral movement using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) and compromised routers to bypass network segmentation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**: This involves accessing credential material stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. The Responder tool is often used for this purpose, as it can capture hashes or clear text credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1201-Password Policy Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information on the password policies in place on the target system, which could include password length, complexity, expiration, and more. Knowing the password policy can help attackers create more effective passwords or understand how to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**: This involves techniques used to bypass network segmentation, which could include using compromised routers or other network devices to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where the Lazarus group is in the process of credential access and plans to achieve lateral movement. 
   - Collecting password policy information (T1201) before attempting lateral movement could provide valuable insights into how to create credentials that are more likely to succeed in the target environment, thus aiding in evasion techniques.
   - The use of WMIC for lateral movement and compromised routers for bypassing network segmentation indicates a sophisticated approach to navigating the target network, suggesting that the group would likely take steps to understand the environment thoroughly, including its password policies.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The Lazarus group is engaged in credential access using the Responder tool, indicating a focus on gaining credentials.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively use these credentials for lateral movement, understanding the password policy (T1201) could be beneficial for creating or guessing valid credentials.
   - **Step 3**: The planned use of WMIC and compromised routers for lateral movement and network boundary bridging (T1599) suggests a strategic approach to network navigation, which would be enhanced by prior knowledge of the target's password policies.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is reasonable to assume that the Lazarus group would collect password policy information to facilitate more effective lateral movement and defense evasion.

Final Answer: A
