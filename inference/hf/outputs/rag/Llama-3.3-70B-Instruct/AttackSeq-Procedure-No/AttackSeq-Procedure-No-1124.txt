To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a spear-phishing attack uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access. It then asks if it's likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This involves exploiting a vulnerability in client applications to execute malicious code. The use of a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) falls under this category, as it exploits a client-side application vulnerability for execution.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**: This technique involves downgrading a security protocol or mechanism to a less secure version to evade detection or to make exploitation easier. Downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes is an example of this, as it involves reducing the security of the NTLM protocol to obtain authentication credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves sending malicious attachments via email to gain initial access to a system. The spear-phishing attack mentioned in the question aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access is gained through a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit, which aligns with T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - The question then asks about downgrading NTLM to capture hashes before installing a payload. This action is related to T1562.010 (Downgrade Attack), which is a defense evasion technique. It's plausible that after gaining initial access, an attacker might attempt to downgrade NTLM to capture hashes for further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
   - The installation of a payload embedded in a GIF image suggests a multi-stage attack where the initial exploit (Flash) leads to further malicious activities, potentially including the evasion techniques like downgrading NTLM.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Flash file, which is a common vector for exploiting client-side vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 2**: The exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 allows the attacker to execute malicious code on the client's system.
   - **Step 3**: As part of the attack, downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes (a defense evasion technique) could be a logical step to facilitate further access or lateral movement within the network.
   - **Step 4**: The final step involves the installation of a payload, which could be embedded in a seemingly innocuous file like a GIF image, furthering the attacker's goals within the compromised system.

Given the logical progression of the attack and the techniques involved, it's reasonable to conclude that downgrading NTLM to capture hashes could indeed be part of the attack sequence before the payload installation.

**Final Answer: A**
