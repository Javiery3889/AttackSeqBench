To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that involve network service discovery using specific tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, fscan) during the discovery phase. It then asks if it's likely that Earth Lusca would deploy the Cobalt Strike loader, disguised as a system update service, after gaining initial access through spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTP (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery) indicates that the initial step involves discovering services on a network, which aligns with the use of network scanning tools mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - The initial action of network service discovery (using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, fscan) is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack, aiming to identify open ports and services on a target network.
    - The question then jumps to the execution phase, where the attacker (Earth Lusca) is considering deploying the Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service.
    - The initial access is gained through spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks, which are common tactics for gaining initial access to a network.
    - The deployment of the Cobalt Strike loader as a disguised system update service after gaining initial access is a plausible next step, as Cobalt Strike is a tool often used by attackers for post-exploitation activities, including establishing persistence and moving laterally within a network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - **Step 1**: The initial network service discovery aligns with the discovery phase and the related TTP (T1046-Network Service Discovery).
    - **Step 2**: Gaining initial access through spear phishing and malicious JavaScript is a common and effective method used by attackers.
    - **Step 3**: Deploying the Cobalt Strike loader as part of post-exploitation activities, disguised as a system update, is consistent with tactics used by sophisticated attackers to maintain access and evade detection.
    - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the tactics described, it is plausible that Earth Lusca would follow this sequence of actions, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A
