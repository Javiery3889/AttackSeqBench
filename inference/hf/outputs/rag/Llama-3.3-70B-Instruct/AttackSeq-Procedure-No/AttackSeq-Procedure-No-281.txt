To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after establishing command and control (C2) communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode, the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer. This involves gathering details such as the victim's name and system information to transmit to its server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP indicates that an adversary is likely to gather information about the system they have compromised. System Information Discovery includes gathering details about the system's configuration, architecture, and other relevant details that could be useful for further exploitation or for exfiltrating specific data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This TTP involves using symmetric encryption (like AES) for communication between the compromised system and the command and control server. Symmetric cryptography is often used for encrypting data in transit due to its efficiency and speed, ensuring that communications remain confidential.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode for C2 communication (related to T1573.001) suggests that the adversary is taking steps to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the communication channel. This is a common practice among sophisticated threats to evade detection.
   - The technique T1082 (System Information Discovery) is a common follow-up action after establishing a foothold in a system. Knowing the system's details helps in planning the next steps, whether it's lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The OceanLotus backdoor has established a secure communication channel, which is a typical initial step in a cyber attack to maintain command and control over the compromised system.
   - **Step 2**: Given that system information discovery (T1082) is a common tactic used by adversaries to understand the environment they are operating in, it is reasonable to assume that after establishing C2, the next logical step would involve gathering system information.
   - **Step 3**: The use of symmetric cryptography for C2 communication supports the notion that the adversary is interested in maintaining a covert presence, which aligns with the goal of surveying the system without immediate detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the provided TTPs and the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like the OceanLotus backdoor, it is plausible that after initiating command and control communication, the malware would survey the victim's computer to gather system information.

Final Answer: A
