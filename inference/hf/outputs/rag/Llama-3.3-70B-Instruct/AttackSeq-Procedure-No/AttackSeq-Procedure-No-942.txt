To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where SLUB malware has already collected system information and captured screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server. This activity is categorized under the Discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker gathers information about the target system or network. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the Command and Control (C2) server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041). This technique involves transferring data from a compromised system to a C2 server controlled by the attacker. The fact that exfiltration over a C2 channel is mentioned suggests that the attackers have the capability and intention to move data from the compromised system to their controlled servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the malware has already collected sensitive information (system information and screenshots) and considering the provided TTPs, it is logical to assume that the next step in the attack sequence would involve exfiltrating this collected data. The technique of exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041) directly supports this assumption, as it is a common method used by attackers to transfer stolen data from a compromised system to their C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The malware has collected system information and screenshots, which is valuable for the attackers.
    - The Exfiltration tactic and the specific technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) are relevant to the scenario, indicating a method by which collected data can be transferred to the attackers' C2 server.
    - Given the context and the TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed exfiltrate the collected data as part of the Exfiltration phase.
    - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that after collecting data, the malware would automatically exfiltrate this data to the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
