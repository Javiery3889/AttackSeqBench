To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attack group has attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. It then asks if it's likely that the group would send spearphishing emails with hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold into victim networks before securing alternative means of persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access
   - Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link: This involves sending spearphishing emails that contain links to malicious files or websites.
   - Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment: This involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the attack group is trying to gain a foothold into victim networks, the techniques mentioned (T1566.002 and T1566.001) are both relevant methods for achieving initial access. The question specifically mentions sending spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files, which aligns with T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link. This technique is a common method used by attackers to trick victims into clicking on links that lead to malicious downloads or credential harvesting sites, thereby gaining initial access to the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack group has already attempted phishing, indicating they are looking for ways to trick users into divulging credentials or installing malware.
   - Spearphishing with links (T1566.002) is a direct method to achieve initial access by either leading victims to download malware or to credential harvesting sites.
   - Securing alternative means of persistence after initial access is a common next step for attackers to maintain access to the network even if the initial entry point is discovered and closed.
   - The provided TTPs support the use of spearphishing as a method for initial access, and the scenario described fits within the tactics and techniques outlined.

**Final Answer: A**
