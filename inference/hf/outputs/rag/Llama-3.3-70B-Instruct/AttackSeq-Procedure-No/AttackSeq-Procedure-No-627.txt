To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor, which has established a Command and Control (C2) channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The question asks whether, after establishing this C2 channel, it is likely that the malware performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Command and Control (Tactic) and include techniques such as protocol tunneling (T1572) and using DNS for C2 (T1071.004). Additionally, there's a mention of process discovery (T1057) under the Discovery Tactic. These TTPs indicate methods used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and gather information about the system and its processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - Establishing a C2 channel is a critical step for attackers to issue commands to compromised systems. The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP (T1572 and T1071.004) suggests an attempt to evade detection while maintaining control.
    - After establishing a C2 channel, the next logical steps for an attacker would involve gathering information about the compromised system to understand its capabilities, vulnerabilities, and potential valuable data. Process discovery (T1057) is a technique used to gather information about the running processes on a system, which can help in identifying potential security software, system configuration, and running applications that could be exploited or used for further malicious activities.
    - System information discovery, while not explicitly listed in the provided TTPs, is a common follow-up action to process discovery, as it helps in gathering more detailed information about the system, such as its operating system version, network configuration, and installed software.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The establishment of a C2 channel indicates the attacker's interest in controlling and potentially exploiting the compromised system.
    - Process discovery (T1057) is a logical next step after establishing control, as it provides valuable insights into the system's current state and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Although system information discovery is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is a complementary action to process discovery and aligns with the goals of the Discovery phase.
    - Therefore, given the context and the typical progression of attack tactics, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing a C2 channel, the malware would likely perform process discovery and potentially system information discovery.

Final Answer: A
