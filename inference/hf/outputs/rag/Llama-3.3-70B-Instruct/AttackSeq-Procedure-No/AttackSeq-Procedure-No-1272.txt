To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec for Defense Evasion, specifically to stop services and disable Windows Defender. It then asks if, in the Impact phase, the ransomware is likely to delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Impact" and the technique "T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery". This technique involves actions taken by an adversary to inhibit system recovery. Deleting system volume shadow copies is a method used to prevent a system from recovering from a previous state, thereby inhibiting system recovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The use of PsExec for Defense Evasion indicates the adversary is taking steps to evade detection and maintain access/control.
   - The specific mention of stopping services and disabling Windows Defender suggests the adversary is clearing a path for the ransomware to operate without interference.
   - The technique T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery) directly relates to actions that would prevent the system from being restored to a previous, uninfected state. Deleting system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands is a common method associated with this technique, as it removes the ability to restore the system from a shadow copy, thus amplifying the impact of the ransomware by making recovery more difficult.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The adversary has already demonstrated an intent to evade defenses and ensure the ransomware's effectiveness by stopping services and disabling Windows Defender.
   - **Step 2**: The technique of inhibiting system recovery (T1490) is directly relevant to the actions typically taken by ransomware to maximize the impact of the attack.
   - **Step 3**: Deleting system volume shadow copies is a known method used to inhibit system recovery, aligning with the described tactic and technique.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack and the specific TTPs mentioned, it is logical to conclude that the ransomware would indeed attempt to delete system volume shadow copies to prevent system recovery, which aligns with the Impact phase's goals.

Final Answer: A
