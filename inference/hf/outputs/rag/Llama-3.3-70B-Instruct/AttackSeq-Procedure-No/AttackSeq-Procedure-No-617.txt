To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Hidden Cobra, presumably a threat actor, has developed implants (Bankshot) that can give them full control over victim systems and wipe files. This capability is mentioned under the tactic of Resource Development. The question then asks if it's likely that Hidden Cobra will use spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability in client applications to execute malicious code. The exploitation of CVE-2018-4878, a vulnerability that can be used to execute arbitrary code, fits into this category.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves sending spear phishing emails with attachments that contain malicious content to gain initial access to a system. The scenario described in the question, where a malicious Word document is sent via spear phishing to exploit CVE-2018-4878, aligns with this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The development of implants like Bankshot under the Resource Development tactic indicates that Hidden Cobra has the capability and interest in developing tools for exploiting and controlling systems.
   - The use of spear phishing with malicious attachments (T1566.001) is a common method for gaining initial access to systems, especially when combined with the exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-4878 (T1203).
   - Given that the question specifies targeting Turkish financial organizations, it suggests a focused effort by Hidden Cobra, which could be plausible given the group's demonstrated capabilities and interests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Hidden Cobra has developed capabilities (Bankshot implants) that suggest an interest in controlling and manipulating victim systems.
   - **Step 2**: The TTPs provided (T1203 for exploitation and T1566.001 for spear phishing) align with the methods described in the question for gaining initial access.
   - **Step 3**: The targeting of specific sectors (like financial organizations in Turkey) via spear phishing and exploitation of known vulnerabilities is a plausible attack vector given the described capabilities and TTPs.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the alignment of the described attack methods with known TTPs and the capabilities demonstrated by Hidden Cobra, it is reasonable to conclude that such an attack is likely.

Final Answer: A
