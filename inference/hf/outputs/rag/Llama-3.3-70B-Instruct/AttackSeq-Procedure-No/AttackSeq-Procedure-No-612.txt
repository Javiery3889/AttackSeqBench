To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with spear phishing emails that contain an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This exploit is used to gain initial access to the target system.

2. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)**: The exploit is specifically used for client execution, meaning the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (in this case, Adobe Flash) to execute malicious code on the client-side. The malicious Word document "Agreement.docx" is the vehicle for this exploitation.

3. **Bankshot Implant**: After the initial exploitation, the Bankshot implant is executed. The Bankshot implant is known for its ability to gather system information among other capabilities.

4. **Use of a COM Object**: The question asks whether it is likely that the Bankshot implant will use a COM (Component Object Model) object to execute queries to gather system information.

Given the context and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved:

- **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)** indicates that the attacker is leveraging vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. This technique is often followed by establishing a foothold, gathering information, and potentially moving laterally within a network.
  
- The use of a **COM object** to execute queries for gathering system information is a plausible next step after initial exploitation. COM objects can be used to interact with the operating system and other applications, allowing the implant to gather detailed system information without being overly suspicious.

- The **Bankshot implant** being executed via the exploitation in the malicious Word document aligns with the scenario where an attacker would want to gather system information as part of the post-exploitation phase.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access and executing the Bankshot implant through the exploitation of a client-side vulnerability, using a COM object to gather system information is a likely next step in the attack sequence.
