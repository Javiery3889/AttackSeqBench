To answer this question, let's break down the steps as instructed:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware is involved in communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration. It specifically mentions avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals. The question then asks if the malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for Command and Control (C&C) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related Tactics and Techniques (TTPs) provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control communications. Given that HTTPS is a web protocol, this TTP supports the idea of using HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, **Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This suggests that data exfiltration is scheduled, which aligns with the "scheduled exfiltration" mentioned in the question. Scheduled transfers can help avoid detection by spreading out the data transfer over time, potentially avoiding upload limits and using randomized intervals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions scheduled exfiltration and the use of HTTPS for C&C communication, which aligns with the TTPs provided (T1071.001 for web protocols and T1029 for scheduled transfer).
   - The use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS for C&C communication per target suggests a sophisticated method to maintain stealth and ensure the integrity of the communication between the malware and its C&C servers.
   - Given the context of avoiding detection and the specific mention of using HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol, it suggests a level of sophistication that would likely involve configuring specific domain and IP address combinations per target to further evade detection and ensure reliable communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario involving scheduled exfiltration and sophisticated C&C communication methods.
   - The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for C&C and scheduled data transfers for exfiltration.
   - The scenario's details about avoiding detection and using custom cryptographic protocols over HTTPS suggest a tailored approach per target.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Longhorn's malware would indeed configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to maintain stealth and ensure effective command and control.

Final Answer: A
