To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by SunBird and Hornbill, which include collecting data, compressing it, and storing it in hidden folders. The key part of the question is about the exfiltration of this data over C2 (Command and Control) channels and the condition that this happens after the C2 infrastructure is used to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This indicates that the attackers are collecting data and archiving it, which aligns with the initial steps described in the question (collecting data, compressing it into ZIP files, and storing it in hidden folders).
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This TTP is about exfiltrating data over command and control channels, which directly relates to the latter part of the question regarding the exfiltration of the collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if the exfiltration of data (using T1041) is contingent upon the C2 infrastructure being used for storing or exposing the exfiltrated data. 
   - Typically, the use of C2 channels for exfiltration (T1041) is a method to transfer stolen data from the victim's network to the attacker's servers. The condition mentioned (using C2 infrastructure to store or expose the data after exfiltration) seems to imply a specific sequence or dependency in the attack workflow.
   - However, the standard understanding of exfiltration over C2 channels does not inherently require the C2 infrastructure to first be used for storing or exposing the data as a prerequisite for exfiltration itself. Exfiltration is often a step that precedes the storage or exposure of the data on the attacker's infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question's premise seems to misunderstand or misrepresent the typical sequence of operations in a cyber attack, particularly regarding how and when data is exfiltrated over C2 channels.
   - The exfiltration of data (T1041) is generally a step that occurs to transfer data from the compromised system to the attacker's control, not necessarily after the data is stored or exposed by the C2 infrastructure.
   - Therefore, based on the standard understanding of these TTPs and the typical workflow of cyber attacks, it is unlikely that the exfiltration would be contingent on the C2 infrastructure being used in such a manner as described in the question.

Final Answer: B
