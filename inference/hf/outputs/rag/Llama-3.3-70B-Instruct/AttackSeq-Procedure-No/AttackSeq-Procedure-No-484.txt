To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker gains initial access to a system by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. After gaining access, the attacker executes SparrowDoor, which is a piece of malware, using cmd.exe commands. The question then asks if it's likely that SparrowDoor will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to control its activation or deactivation based on the user agent for Command and Control purposes.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a network. This aligns with the initial part of the question where the attacker exploits remote code execution vulnerabilities.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using signals or patterns in network traffic to communicate with compromised systems, which could include modifying traffic based on specific conditions like user agents.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to initially access a network, which could be related to exploiting vulnerabilities in external applications or services.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a specific scenario of exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) for initial access and then executing malware (SparrowDoor) for further malicious activities.
   - The modification of the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent suggests a level of customization and control over Command and Control (C2) communications, which aligns with the concept of traffic signaling (T1205).
   - Given that SparrowDoor is executed for malicious purposes and considering the techniques related to Command and Control, it's plausible that such malware could be designed to interact with or modify existing infrastructure (like VPN modules) to facilitate its C2 communications in a stealthy or controlled manner.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access is gained through exploiting public-facing applications, which matches T1190.
   - The execution of SparrowDoor for malicious purposes could involve establishing a Command and Control channel, potentially utilizing techniques like traffic signaling (T1205) to manage communications.
   - Modifying a VPN module based on user agents could be a sophisticated way to control the malware's communication, fitting within the realm of traffic signaling for C2 purposes.
   - Therefore, considering the context and the related TTPs, it seems plausible that SparrowDoor could modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module for Command and Control purposes.

Final Answer: A
