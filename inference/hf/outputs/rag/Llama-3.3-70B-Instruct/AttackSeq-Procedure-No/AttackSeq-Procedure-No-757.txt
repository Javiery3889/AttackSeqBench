To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where data is exfiltrated using Base64 encoding, and then it queries whether the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel (using RC4) before performing initial reconnaissance. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to command and control (C2) communications, data encoding, and system reconnaissance.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This indicates the use of standard encoding schemes for C2 communications, which could include Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This suggests the use of encryption or encoding to evade detection, which aligns with using RC4 for encrypting C2 communications.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This implies the ability to decode or deobfuscate files or information, which would be necessary for the implant to understand and act on the exfiltrated data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of Base64 encoding for data exfiltration (as mentioned in the question) aligns with **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**.
   - The encryption of C2 communications using RC4 (as queried in the question) can be seen as a method to evade detection, aligning with **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**.
   - The initial reconnaissance activities (gathering system and network information) are not directly mentioned in the provided TTPs but are common initial steps for an implant to understand its environment before further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question essentially asks if the implant's communication with control servers via an encrypted channel (RC4) before performing initial reconnaissance is likely, given the context of data exfiltration using Base64 encoding.
   - The provided TTPs support the use of encoding and encryption for C2 communications and data exfiltration, which are tactics used to maintain stealth and evade detection.
   - Given that the implant has already exfiltrated data, it is reasonable to assume it would use secure communication methods (like RC4 encryption) to communicate with its control servers.
   - The initial reconnaissance activities, while not directly addressed by the TTPs provided, are a plausible next step after establishing secure communication, as they would provide necessary information for further operations.

**Final Answer: A**
