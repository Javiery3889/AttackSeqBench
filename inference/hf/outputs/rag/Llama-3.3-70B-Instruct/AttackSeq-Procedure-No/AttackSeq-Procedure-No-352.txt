To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial access vector where a weaponized RTF document exploits a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to drop a downloader. This downloader is associated with the MSIL/Crimson malware. The question asks whether it's likely that this malware would execute native Windows functions (like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before establishing command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to execute system commands or functions. The use of GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo fits within this technique as both are native Windows functions that can be used to gather system information.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the rundll32.exe utility to execute malicious code, which can be a part of defense evasion tactics but is not directly related to the execution of native Windows functions for system information gathering.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code, which aligns with the initial access vector described (exploiting CVE-2012-0158).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question focuses on the behavior of the MSIL/Crimson malware post-exploitation. The exploitation (T1203) is the initial step, which aligns with the described scenario of using a weaponized RTF document to exploit CVE-2012-0158.
   - The use of native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before establishing C2 is a plausible step for malware to understand its environment and potentially prepare for further malicious activities. This aligns with T1106-Native API, which is about executing system commands or functions.
   - Establishing C2 using a custom TCP protocol is a common step for malware to communicate with its command and control servers, which would logically follow initial system reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware gains initial access through exploitation (T1203).
   - **Step 2**: It's reasonable for the malware to use native APIs (T1106) to gather system information (using functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) to assess its environment.
   - **Step 3**: After gathering necessary information, the malware would likely establish C2 for further instructions, which involves communication protocols not explicitly listed in the TTPs but is a common next step.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the provided TTPs and the typical behavior of malware post-exploitation, it is plausible that the MSIL/Crimson malware would execute native Windows functions before establishing command and control.

Final Answer: A
