To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if it's likely that adversaries compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor before exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) via spear phishing emails for initial access. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries might use to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic, which is about how attackers gain their initial foothold into a system or network. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems or applications to gain access. While this could potentially include exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications or services, it doesn't directly imply compromising updates.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending phishing emails with malicious links to gain access. This is relevant to the spear phishing part of the question but doesn't directly relate to compromising updates.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: Similar to the previous technique, this involves sending phishing emails with malicious attachments. Again, this is relevant to the spear phishing aspect but doesn't directly involve compromising updates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: The question specifically asks about compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor before using spear phishing with a Microsoft Office vulnerability exploit. The provided TTPs focus on exploiting public-facing applications and spear phishing, which are methods of gaining initial access but do not directly address the compromise of updates for delivering backdoors.

   Given the information and the TTPs provided, compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor is not directly mentioned or implied by the techniques T1190, T1566.002, or T1566.001. These techniques are more about direct exploitation or deception to gain access rather than manipulating updates.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question implies a multi-step attack process starting with compromising updates, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
   - The TTPs focus on exploiting vulnerabilities and using spear phishing, which are direct methods of gaining access.
   - There's no direct evidence or implication in the provided TTPs that suggests compromising legitimate web browser updates is a likely precursor to the described spear phishing attack using a Microsoft Office vulnerability.

**Final Answer: B**
