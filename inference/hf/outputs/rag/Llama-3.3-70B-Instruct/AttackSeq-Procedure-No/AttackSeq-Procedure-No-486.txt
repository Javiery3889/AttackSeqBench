To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, FamousSparrow, has already gained credential access using a custom version of Mimikatz. The question then asks if it's likely for the attacker to perform certain actions during the Discovery phase before exfiltrating files. The actions in question are retrieving metadata for files on disk, listing the current working directory, reading file contents, and exfiltrating them to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This suggests an action that could be taken by an attacker to disrupt or destroy data, but it doesn't directly relate to the discovery or exfiltration process.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This directly relates to the actions described in the question, such as retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory, which are typical steps in the discovery phase of an attack.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a sequence of actions that starts with credential access (already achieved) and moves towards discovery and potentially exfiltration.
   - The technique T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) aligns with the actions of retrieving metadata and listing directories, which are common steps for an attacker to understand the layout and content of a compromised system before deciding what to exfiltrate.
   - While T1485 (Data Destruction) is mentioned, it doesn't directly pertain to the sequence of discovering and exfiltrating data but rather to a potential later stage of an attack where an attacker might seek to cover their tracks or cause harm.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already gained credential access, which is a prerequisite for further actions like discovery and exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: During the discovery phase, it's logical for an attacker to want to understand what files are available and their locations, which aligns with T1083 (File and Directory Discovery).
   - **Step 3**: After identifying files of interest, reading their contents and exfiltrating them to a C&C server would be a natural next step for an attacker aiming to steal sensitive information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs provided, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would engage in these actions as part of a coherent attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
