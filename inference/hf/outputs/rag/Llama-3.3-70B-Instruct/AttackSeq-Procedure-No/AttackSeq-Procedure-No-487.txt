To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of actions attributed to FamousSparrow, a threat actor. The sequence starts with gaining initial access through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in specific software (Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera). Following this initial access, the question posits the use of cmd.exe for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor. Finally, it mentions acquiring infrastructure from several companies for resource development.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application, which falls under the tactic of Initial Access. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access to a network. The exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera, as mentioned in the question, aligns with this technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: 
    - The initial action described (exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access) matches the related TTP (T1190).
    - The use of cmd.exe to download and install a backdoor (SparrowDoor) after gaining initial access is a plausible next step for establishing persistence and maintaining access, which is a common goal after initial access is achieved.
    - Acquiring infrastructure for resource development could be part of the threat actor's efforts to expand their capabilities, host command and control (C2) servers, or conduct other malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - **Initial Access**: The question starts with FamousSparrow exploiting public-facing applications, which aligns with T1190.
    - **Establishing Persistence**: Using cmd.exe to download and install a backdoor is a method to ensure continued access to the compromised system.
    - **Resource Development**: Acquiring infrastructure can support various malicious activities, including hosting backdoor C2 channels.

Given the logical progression from initial access, to establishing a persistent presence through a backdoor, and then acquiring resources to support further operations, the sequence described in the question seems plausible based on the provided TTP.

**Final Answer: A**
