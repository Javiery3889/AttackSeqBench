To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether attackers will ensure persistence within the target network only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system, following the use of increased privileges to spread or gain access to strategic goals. This implies a sequence of actions where attackers first gain privileges, then possibly execute malicious code, and finally ensure persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users within an organization into performing certain actions that aid in the lateral movement of the attacker within the network. It's about spreading within the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to maintain persistence within a network. Attackers create or modify accounts to ensure they can regain access to a system even if their initial entry point is closed.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account**: Similar to the previous technique, this involves creating or modifying local accounts for persistence, focusing on creating a new local account or modifying an existing one to maintain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if persistence is ensured after executing malicious code, as part of the attack sequence that includes lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - The related TTPs indicate that after moving laterally (spreading to other systems) and possibly using techniques like internal spearphishing, attackers would indeed want to ensure they can maintain access (persistence) to the network.
   - Executing malicious code can be a part of the process to establish persistence, as it can be used to create backdoors, modify system settings, or create new accounts for future access.
   - However, the question's phrasing suggests a linear sequence that might oversimplify the complex and dynamic nature of real-world attacks. In practice, ensuring persistence can happen concurrently with or even before the execution of malicious code, depending on the attackers' goals and the network's defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Attackers use increased privileges to spread or gain access to strategic goals.
   - As part of their tactics, they might execute malicious code to facilitate further movement or to establish a foothold.
   - Ensuring persistence is a key goal, which can be achieved through various techniques, including the creation or modification of local accounts.
   - Given the related TTPs, it seems plausible that attackers would ensure persistence as part of their strategy, potentially after or concurrently with executing malicious code, depending on their strategy.
   - However, the question's framing as "only after executing malicious code" might not fully capture the complexity of real attack sequences.

Given the above analysis, the most straightforward interpretation of the question suggests that persistence is indeed a goal that follows the initial stages of an attack, which can include the execution of malicious code. However, the "only after" part of the question might not fully align with the dynamic nature of cyber attacks. 

**Final Answer: B**
