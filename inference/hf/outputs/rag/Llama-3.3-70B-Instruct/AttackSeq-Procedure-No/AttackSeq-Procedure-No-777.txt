To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an MSI (Microsoft Installer) package has already achieved persistence by installing an LNK (shortcut) file set to autorun at Windows startup. This implies that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system and has established a method for their malware to run automatically upon system startup. The question then asks if it's likely that a malicious XLS (Excel) attachment would use a VB (Visual Basic) macro to silently download and execute a malicious MSI package.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves using malicious files to execute malicious code. The use of a malicious XLS file with a VB macro to download and execute an MSI package falls under this category, as it involves executing code through a file that is not typically considered executable.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.007-Msiexec**: This technique involves using the Windows Installer (msiexec) to execute malicious code, potentially evading defenses that do not monitor or block msiexec executions. The initial part of the question mentions an MSI package achieving persistence, which could be related to this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the MSI package has already achieved persistence, the question seems to imply a sequence of events where the initial infection vector might not be the XLS attachment but rather the MSI package itself or another vector that led to the MSI package being installed.
   - The use of a VB macro in an XLS file to download and execute an MSI package is a plausible method for initial infection or for downloading additional payloads. However, the question's context suggests that the system is already compromised to some extent (with the MSI package achieving persistence).
   - The related TTPs support the idea that malicious files (including office documents with macros) can be used for execution, and msiexec can be used for defense evasion. However, the specific sequence of using an XLS file to download an MSI package after an MSI package has already been used to achieve persistence might not be the most direct or necessary step in an attack sequence, unless the attackers are downloading an updated or different MSI package for further exploitation or evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already established persistence with an MSI package.
   - The use of an XLS file with a VB macro to download and execute an MSI package is a known tactic for initial infection or for downloading additional payloads.
   - Given the context that the system is already compromised, the question's scenario seems plausible as a method for either initial infection (if the XLS is the initial vector) or for further exploitation (if the system is already compromised and the attackers are updating their tools).
   - However, the question asks if it is "likely" that the malicious XLS attachment would be used in this manner after the MSI package has achieved persistence. Given the attackers have already compromised the system, using another vector like an XLS to download an MSI might not be necessary unless it serves a specific purpose (like updating malware or evading defenses).

Considering these points, the scenario described is technically possible and aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. Therefore, the answer to whether it is likely that the malicious XLS attachment would use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution, given the context provided, leans towards affirming the plausibility of such an action within the broader context of cyber attacks.
