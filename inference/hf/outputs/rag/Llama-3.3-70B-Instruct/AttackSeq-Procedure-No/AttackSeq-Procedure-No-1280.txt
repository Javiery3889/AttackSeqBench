To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT10 uses DLL Side-Loading to load malicious DLLs during initial access. It then asks if it's likely that APT10 will connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Persistence and the technique of T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading. DLL Side-Loading is a technique used by attackers to load malicious DLLs by hijacking legitimate executables. This technique is often used for initial access or execution but can also be part of establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
    - **DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002)** is used for initial access, which aligns with the first part of the question.
    - Connecting to the IPC$ (Inter-Process Communication) share is a method that can be used for lateral movement (T1021 - Remote Services) or for establishing a foothold within a network. It allows attackers to access remote machines without being detected easily.
    - Establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key are techniques (T1543 - Create or Modify System Process and T1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, respectively) that attackers use to maintain access to a system over time.

Given the context, after using DLL Side-Loading for initial access, an attacker like APT10 might attempt to move laterally within the network or establish persistence. Connecting to the IPC$ share could be a step in lateral movement or in preparing for persistence by accessing remote systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The initial access is achieved through DLL Side-Loading.
    - The next logical steps for an attacker would be to either move laterally or establish persistence.
    - Connecting to the IPC$ share can facilitate both lateral movement and the preparation for establishing persistence by allowing access to remote systems.
    - Therefore, it is plausible that after initial access, APT10 would connect to the IPC$ share as part of their tactics to either move laterally or prepare for persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
