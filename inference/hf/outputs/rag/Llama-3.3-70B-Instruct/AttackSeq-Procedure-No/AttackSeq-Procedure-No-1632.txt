To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary is in the process of collecting data, specifically from Microsoft SharePoint Online, as part of the collection phase. The data is being prepared for exfiltration by compressing and encrypting it, and the question asks whether the adversary is likely to divide files if they exceed a certain size (0x1000000 bytes or more) before collecting them.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint**: This indicates the adversary is targeting SharePoint for data collection, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves the adversary considering the size limits of data transfers to avoid detection. Dividing large files could be a method to stay under these limits, making exfiltration less detectable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question is about the collection phase but involves preparing data for exfiltration, which includes considering data transfer size limits to avoid detection.
   - The technique T1030 (Data Transfer Size Limits) suggests that adversaries are aware of and try to work around size limits to exfiltrate data without being detected. Dividing large files into smaller chunks would be a plausible strategy to achieve this, especially when dealing with large datasets that exceed specific size thresholds (like 0x1000000 bytes or more).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary is preparing data for exfiltration by compressing and encrypting it, indicating a desire to avoid detection.
   - The specific mention of a size threshold (0x1000000 bytes or more) suggests that file size is a consideration for the adversary.
   - The related TTPs indicate that both collection from SharePoint and considerations for data transfer size limits are relevant to the adversary's tactics.
   - Given these points, dividing files to avoid exceeding size limits would be a logical step for an adversary trying to exfiltrate large amounts of data without being detected.

Final Answer: A
