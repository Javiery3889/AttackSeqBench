To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether, after using web session cookies for credential access to cloud resources, the StellarParticle campaign would likely steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the StellarParticle campaign, specifically how it uses web session cookies, credential hopping, and malware for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.004-Web Session Cookie**: This indicates the use of web session cookies to facilitate movement within a network, potentially to access cloud resources or other systems.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This involves stealing web session cookies as a means to gain access to credentials or to maintain access to systems or resources without needing the actual credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question implies a sequence of actions: accessing cloud resources using web session cookies, then potentially stealing more web session cookies after using credential hopping and setting up persistence mechanisms.
   - Credential hopping (not explicitly listed as a TTP but implied in the context of lateral movement and accessing different systems) and configuring malware for persistence (like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence) suggest a sophisticated campaign aimed at deepening access and control within a network.
   - Stealing web session cookies (T1539) can be a part of both initial access and lateral movement tactics, depending on the context. If the campaign has already used web session cookies for credential access, stealing more could be a way to expand access or maintain it without relying on the initial entry point.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the initial use of web session cookies for accessing cloud resources, which aligns with credential access techniques.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the potential for lateral movement and the expansion of access within the network, which could involve stealing more web session cookies.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the role of credential hopping and malware configuration for persistence, which suggests a campaign focused on establishing a strong foothold within the network.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the likelihood of stealing web session cookies after these actions, considering it as a plausible next step for maintaining or expanding access.

Given the information and the context of the StellarParticle campaign's tactics, it seems plausible that after initial access and establishing persistence, the campaign would continue to steal web session cookies as part of its efforts to maintain and expand access within the network. Therefore, the answer to whether it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
