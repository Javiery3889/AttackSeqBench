To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro is used for initial access. The macro then uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. The question asks if it's likely that the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours before the VBA macro executes its commands.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates the use of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on a compromised system. Scheduled tasks can be used to execute malicious programs or scripts at specific times or intervals, which aligns with the concept of creating a task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This refers to the use of Visual Basic (VB) scripts for execution. VBA macros, like the one described in the phishing document, fall under this category. The use of 'mshta.exe' by the VBA macro to download and execute additional malware is a method of executing malicious code.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question outlines a specific sequence of events: initial access via a phishing email with a malicious document, followed by the execution of a VBA macro that uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper. The establishment of persistence through creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' every two hours is a plausible next step for maintaining access to the compromised system.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence. The use of scheduled tasks for persistence (T1053.005) and the execution via Visual Basic (T1059.005) are both relevant to the actions described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial access vector involves a phishing email with a malicious document, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a VBA macro to execute 'mshta.exe' for downloading and executing a dropper is a known technique for executing malicious code.
   - **Step 3**: Establishing persistence is a logical next step after initial access and execution of malicious code. Creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' at regular intervals (every two hours) aligns with the T1053.005 technique for persistence.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that after gaining initial access and executing malicious code, the malware would establish persistence by creating a scheduled task. The sequence of events described in the question aligns with known TTPs used by adversaries.

Final Answer: A
