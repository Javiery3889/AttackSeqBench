To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that after APT10 used DLL sideloading for defense evasion, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gain initial access to the networks. DLL sideloading is a technique used for defense evasion, indicating the attackers were already inside the network or had some level of access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic of Defense Evasion and a technique of T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which helps in evading defenses. However, the question asks about gaining initial access, not about the evasion tactic itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1552.001 - Credentials In Files**: This involves obtaining credentials from files. While it could be a method for gaining access, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access vector after DLL sideloading has been used for evasion.
   - **T1078 - Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a network. Given that DLL sideloading is used for defense evasion, it's plausible that the attackers first gained access using valid accounts (which could have been compromised or obtained through other means) and then used DLL sideloading to maintain access or evade detection.
   - **T1078 - Valid Accounts (Duplicate)**: This is a duplicate of the previous option, indicating a potential error in the question formatting.
   - **T1530 - Data from Cloud Storage**: This involves obtaining data from cloud storage services. While it could be relevant in certain contexts, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access method after using DLL sideloading for evasion.

Given the context that DLL sideloading is used for defense evasion and considering the need for an initial access technique, using valid accounts (which could be stolen, default, or otherwise compromised) is a common method for attackers to gain initial access to a network before employing evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to gain initial access after DLL sideloading was used for defense evasion.
   - DLL sideloading indicates the attackers were past initial access and focusing on evasion.
   - The most common and logical initial access technique that would precede such evasion tactics, especially when considering APT groups like APT10, involves using valid accounts.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred to gain initial access, given the context provided, is using valid accounts.

Final Answer: B
