To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where 'Enigma Protector' is used for defense evasion, and then the malware gathers detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this information gathering phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Discovery) and a technique (T1049-System Network Connections Discovery). This indicates that the attack is in the discovery phase, where the adversary is trying to gather information about the system and its network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. It does not directly relate to gathering system information like network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network connections, which aligns with the scenario described in the question. It is directly related to discovering network configurations and active connections.
   - **C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This technique is about discovering cloud infrastructure, which does not match the scenario of gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections on a local system.
   - **D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves discovering autostart entries, which is more related to persistence and execution rather than gathering network information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, indicating the malware is trying to hide its presence.
   - The next step mentioned is the gathering of detailed system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - The related TTPs point towards the discovery tactic, with a specific technique being T1049-System Network Connections Discovery.
   - Among the answer choices, **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** is the only one that directly aligns with the action of gathering network configurations and active TCP connections.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves using 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion followed by the adversary using **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** to gather system information.

Final Answer: B
