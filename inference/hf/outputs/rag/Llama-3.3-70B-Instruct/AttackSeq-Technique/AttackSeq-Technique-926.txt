To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Explosive Trojan leveraged its capabilities to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan has already been used to move laterally through a network. This lateral movement was achieved through manual methods and USB infection. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after such an action.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement** with **Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**. This indicates that the malware is capable of spreading through removable media, which aligns with the USB infection method mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** with the same **Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**. This suggests that the initial entry into the network could also have been facilitated by removable media.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or to exfiltrate data. While it's a plausible action after establishing a foothold, it doesn't directly relate to the lateral movement or USB infection described.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing input (e.g., keystrokes, mouse movements) from a user. It's more related to gathering information or credentials rather than the direct result of lateral movement via USB infection.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) to access resources without needing the user's password. It's a method of credential manipulation that could be used after gaining access to a system, potentially as a result of lateral movement.
   - **D: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat applications for command and control. While it's a method of communication, it doesn't directly follow from the actions of moving laterally and infecting via USB.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question emphasizes lateral movement and USB infection, which suggests the attacker is looking to expand their access within the network.
   - Given the context of lateral movement and the use of removable media (USB infection), the next logical step would involve consolidating access or escalating privileges.
   - Among the provided options, **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** is closely related to the concept of moving laterally and potentially escalating privileges within a network, as it involves using obtained credentials to access more resources.

**Final Answer: C**
