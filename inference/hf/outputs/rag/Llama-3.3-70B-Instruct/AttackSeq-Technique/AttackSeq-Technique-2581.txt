To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware evaded detection, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker. It uses InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute its payload via proxy execution. This indicates a specific technique where a trusted utility is leveraged to execute malicious code, avoiding traditional detection methods.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Defense Evasion" tactic, which involves techniques an adversary uses to evade detection and bypass security controls. Specifically:
   - **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution** involves using trusted utilities to execute malicious code, which aligns with the use of InstallUtil.exe described in the question.
   - **T1220-XSL Script Processing** and **T1218.004-InstallUtil** are also defense evasion techniques but are more specific to using XSL scripts for evasion and the use of InstallUtil for evasion, respectively.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** is related to obtaining and manipulating information, which does not directly relate to the evasion technique described.
   - **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space** is related to password attacks, which does not fit the context of the question.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** involves encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection, which, while related to evasion, does not directly match the scenario of using a trusted utility for proxy execution.
   - **D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution** directly matches the scenario described, where InstallUtil.exe (a trusted .NET utility) is used for proxy execution to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of InstallUtil.exe for proxy execution to evade detection.
   - The related TTPs highlight defense evasion techniques, with T1127 being directly relevant to the use of trusted utilities for proxy execution.
   - Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of a trusted developer utility (InstallUtil.exe) for proxy execution, which is a direct match for T1127.

Final Answer: D
