To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper, a known threat actor, gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). After gaining access, the execution of a backdoor's installer is triggered, leveraging users' actions or interactions. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that best describes this action of leveraging user interaction for the deployment of the backdoor.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are under the "Execution" tactic, which involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution**, which involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code.
   - **T1204.002: Malicious File**, a sub-technique of **T1204: User Execution**, which involves executing malicious files that can be triggered by users.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** refers to the use of encryption to hide command and control (C2) communications, which doesn't directly relate to the initial execution or deployment of malware through user interaction.
   - **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking** is not directly related to the execution of code through user interaction but rather involves creating a fork of a process to hide malicious activity.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution** involves executing code in existing cloud services without deploying a remote server, which doesn't directly match the scenario of leveraging user interaction for malware deployment.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution** involves executing malicious code by tricking a user into running it, which aligns with the scenario of leveraging users' actions or interactions to trigger the deployment of a backdoor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the backdoor's installer execution was triggered by users' actions or interactions.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under the "Execution" tactic, focusing on exploiting client applications and user execution of malicious files.
   - Given the emphasis on user interaction for triggering the backdoor's deployment, **T1204: User Execution** is the most relevant technique, as it directly involves executing malicious code through user actions.

Final Answer: D
