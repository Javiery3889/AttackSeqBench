To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Explosive Trojan leveraged its keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords and before the attackers employed a Command and Control (C2) framework involving multi-tiered servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan uses keylogging to obtain administrator passwords. This action is associated with the Collection tactic and the Credential Access tactic, specifically through keylogging (T1056.001). After gaining these credentials, the attackers set up a C2 framework with multi-tiered servers. We need to find the technique that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are focused on Collection and Credential Access, with the technique being keylogging (T1056.001). This indicates the initial step of the attack involves gathering credentials, which is crucial for further actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining credentials and then setting up a C2 framework.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is about using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which could be relevant to setting up a C2 framework but doesn't directly follow the action of keylogging in terms of establishing a connection or utilizing gained credentials for network access.
   - **C: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This is a technique used for defense evasion, where the malware spoofs its parent process ID to hide its malicious activity. While useful after initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the setup of a C2 framework or the immediate actions following credential acquisition.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to access a network, which aligns well with the scenario of using gained administrator passwords to access the network remotely before setting up a more complex C2 framework.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first used keylogging to gain administrator passwords, which is a method of credential access.
   - The next logical step would involve using these credentials to access the network or systems remotely.
   - Setting up a C2 framework with multi-tiered servers would be a subsequent step to maintain control and execute further malicious activities.
   - Given these steps, **T1021-Remote Services** is the most plausible technique that occurred after gaining credentials and before setting up the C2 framework, as it directly utilizes the gained credentials for remote access.

Final Answer: D
