To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used by Suckfly during its attempt to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after scanning the corporate internal network for open ports, Suckfly attempted to move laterally. This implies that Suckfly is looking to expand its access within the network, likely exploiting vulnerabilities or using existing network services to its advantage.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This involves targeting individuals within the network to gain access to additional systems or data.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves moving tools within the network to facilitate further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves scanning for open ports and services, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves taking control of existing sessions to move laterally, which could be a possibility but doesn't directly relate to the initial step of scanning for open ports.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique directly involves exploiting services that are accessible over the network, which could be discovered through scanning for open ports. This seems like a strong candidate given the context.
   - **C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This technique involves exploiting Kerberos tickets, which is more specific to Active Directory environments and not directly related to scanning for open ports.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting applications that are internet-facing, which does not align with the scenario of moving laterally within an internal network after scanning for open ports.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that Suckfly scanned the internal network for open ports, the most logical next step in attempting to move laterally would involve exploiting those discovered services.
   - The related TTPs support the idea of lateral movement and network discovery, which aligns with exploiting remote services found to be open.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred during Suckfly's attempt to move laterally is the exploitation of remote services discovered through network scanning.

Final Answer: B
