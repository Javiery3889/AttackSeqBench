To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint to install the AntSword webshell. This action suggests they have gained initial access to the system. Following this, they used Mimikatz to dump credentials, which indicates they have achieved credential access. The next step in the attack sequence involves assessing the content of the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Lateral Movement with the technique T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, and the tactic of Credential Access with the technique T1003.001-LSASS Memory. These are relevant because they show how attackers might move laterally within a network (using exploited services) and gain access to credentials (by accessing LSASS memory), which aligns with the use of Mimikatz.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary enumerating files and directories on the compromised system, which would be a logical step after gaining access and dumping credentials. It helps in understanding the system's layout, finding sensitive data, and planning further actions.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: While process injection is a technique used by attackers to evade detection and execute malicious code within legitimate processes, it doesn't directly relate to assessing the content of the compromised system in the context provided.
   - **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique is specific to discovering cloud account information, which doesn't directly follow from the actions described (exploiting SharePoint, installing a webshell, and dumping credentials).
   - **D: T1036.006-Space after Filename**: This technique is related to a specific method of hiding malicious files or scripts, which doesn't fit the scenario of assessing system content after gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained access to the system and obtained credentials.
   - The next logical step would be to understand the system's layout and content to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence.
   - Among the given options, **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is the technique that most closely aligns with assessing the content of the compromised system after initial access and credential dumping have been achieved.

Final Answer: A
