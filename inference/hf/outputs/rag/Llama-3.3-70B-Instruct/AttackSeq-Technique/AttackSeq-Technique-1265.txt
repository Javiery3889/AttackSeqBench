To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the PowerShell script decrypted the registry contents and executed a new script leading to the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a PowerShell script is used to decrypt registry contents and then execute a new script. This execution leads to the establishment of njRAT, a known remote access tool (RAT), suggesting a sequence of actions aimed at gaining and maintaining unauthorized access to a system. The use of PowerShell for execution and the involvement of decryption indicate techniques related to execution and possibly defense evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which aligns with the initial part of the scenario described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This suggests that the attacker is using methods to decode or deobfuscate files or information, which could relate to the decryption of registry contents mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves the use of fallback or alternate communication channels in case the primary channel is compromised. Given that njRAT has been established, this could be a plausible next step for maintaining persistence and ensuring continued communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While possible, it's more about the method of communication rather than a direct consequence of establishing a RAT.
   - **C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography for obfuscation or encryption. While cryptography is mentioned in the context of decrypting registry contents, this choice seems more related to the initial steps rather than what happens after njRAT is established.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared modules for malicious purposes. While possible in a broader campaign, it doesn't directly follow from the establishment of a RAT like njRAT.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes the establishment of njRAT, a remote access tool, after a series of execution and potential defense evasion techniques.
   - The focus is on what happens after njRAT is established, implying the need for maintaining access or communication.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1008-Fallback Channels** is the most directly related to ensuring continued access and communication after a RAT is established, as it involves setting up alternative communication channels.
   - This would be a logical next step for an attacker to ensure persistence and reliability of their access to the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
