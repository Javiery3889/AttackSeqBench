To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives before exfiltrating data through an established Command and Control (C&C) channel. This implies we are looking for a technique related to collecting information, specifically screenshots, from the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, which is about exfiltrating data from a compromised system using an established C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1113-Screen Capture**, which involves capturing screenshots to gather information about the system or the user's activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot** is related to shutting down or rebooting a system, which does not align with the objective of gathering screenshots.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay** is a technique used for credential harvesting and lateral movement, not directly related to gathering screenshots.
   - **C: T1555.002-Securityd Memory** involves accessing sensitive information from the memory of a security-related process, which, while related to information gathering, is not specifically about capturing screenshots.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture** directly involves capturing screenshots, which aligns with the objective of gathering information through screenshots as part of surveillance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions gathering screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives.
   - The related TTPs highlight the tactic of Collection and the technique of Screen Capture (T1113) as relevant to the context.
   - Among the answer choices, only **D: T1113-Screen Capture** directly corresponds to the action of gathering screenshots.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before exfiltrating data through the established C&C channel, given the objective of gathering screenshots, involves using the Screen Capture technique.

Final Answer: D
