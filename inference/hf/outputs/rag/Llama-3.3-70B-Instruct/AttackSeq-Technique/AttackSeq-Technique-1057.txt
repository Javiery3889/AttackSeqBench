To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, known as Darkhotel, uses advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details. It then asks which ATT&CK technique would most likely be used to enable the maintenance of a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This involves collecting network information about the victim.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique is used for establishing command and control channels, specifically through dynamic DNS or other methods that allow for flexible and changing communication channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1608.001-Upload Malware**: While uploading malware is a common tactic, it doesn't directly relate to maintaining a dynamic network infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is crucial for secure communication but doesn't directly address the dynamic nature of the infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1584.002-DNS Server**: This involves using a DNS server for command and control, which could be part of maintaining a dynamic infrastructure but is more specific to the use of DNS.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure that can be used for command and control or other malicious purposes, which aligns with maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question emphasizes the maintenance of a "global and dynamic network infrastructure" which includes "compromised commercial resources." This suggests the need for a technique that allows for the control and utilization of various infrastructure components for malicious purposes.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of reconnaissance and command and control, indicating that the chosen technique should facilitate these aspects.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** directly addresses the need to compromise and utilize infrastructure for malicious purposes, fitting the description of maintaining a dynamic network infrastructure.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for enabling the Darkhotel APT to maintain its infrastructure would involve compromising infrastructure.

Final Answer: D
