To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion and before it discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after encoding its configuration files for defense evasion, WinDealer needs to perform an action that leads to discovering network configuration and SNS application details. This implies the malware is trying to gather information about the system or network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Defense Evasion" and "Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File." This indicates the malware is using encryption or encoding to evade detection, which aligns with the use of XOR encoding mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. While it could be used for various purposes, including information gathering, it's not directly related to the discovery of network configuration and SNS application details in a manner that suggests it's the most direct next step after encoding files for defense evasion.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and gather information. Given that the malware is looking to discover network configuration and SNS application details, using native APIs could be a plausible method for achieving this, as it allows the malware to query the system directly for such information.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising the malware as a legitimate file or process. While it's a defense evasion technique, it doesn't directly relate to the action of discovering system or network information.
   - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for encryption. Given that the question mentions XOR encoding (a form of symmetric encryption) for defense evasion, moving to asymmetric cryptography doesn't directly align with the next logical step of discovering network and application details.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has already used XOR encoding for defense evasion.
   - The next step involves discovering more about the system or network, specifically network configuration and SNS application details.
   - Among the given options, using **Native API (T1106)** seems the most direct method for achieving this goal, as it allows the malware to directly query the system for the desired information.

Final Answer: B
