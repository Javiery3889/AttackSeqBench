To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain a Poison Ivy server process. The focus is on securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are under the tactic of Command and Control, with techniques including T1571 (Non-Standard Port) and T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol). These techniques suggest the use of unconventional methods for communication to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique involves generating requests to bypass multi-factor authentication, which does not directly relate to securing communication using a custom network protocol.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to indirect command and control traffic, which could be part of securing communication but doesn't directly imply the use of a custom protocol.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique is about executing a process in response to a specific event, which doesn't directly relate to securing or customizing network communication protocols.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves creating an encrypted channel for command and control communications, which aligns with securing communication. Given the context of using a custom network protocol over TCP, creating an encrypted channel would be a logical step to secure this communication, especially when combined with the related TTPs that suggest unconventional communication methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP after establishing persistence.
   - The related TTPs suggest the use of non-standard methods for communication (T1571 and T1095), indicating an effort to evade detection.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant to securing communication, especially when considering the use of a custom protocol which might already be leveraging non-standard ports or protocols (as hinted by the related TTPs).
   - Therefore, securing this custom communication channel with encryption would be a logical step for an attacker to maintain stealthy command and control.

Final Answer: D
