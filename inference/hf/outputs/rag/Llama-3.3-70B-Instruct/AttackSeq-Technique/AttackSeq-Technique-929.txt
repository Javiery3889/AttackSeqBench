To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Volatile Cedar, presumably a threat actor, exploits server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code. This action is followed by using compromised web servers to gain initial access to internal networks. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates that the initial access to the network was gained by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet.
   - **Tactic: Persistence**, **Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This shows that once access was gained, web shells were used as a means to maintain persistence within the compromised environment.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of server vulnerabilities or the use of web shells for initial access.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and could be a precursor to exploiting public-facing applications. It aligns with the reconnaissance phase that typically precedes exploitation.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of exploiting vulnerabilities and using web shells for initial access.
   - **D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**: A subset of active scanning that involves using wordlists to guess passwords, which could be part of the reconnaissance but is more specific to credential guessing rather than vulnerability exploitation.

Given the context that the threat actor exploited server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code and then used compromised web servers for gaining initial access, the most logical precursor to this action would be some form of reconnaissance or scanning to identify vulnerable servers. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The threat actor needs to identify vulnerable servers before exploiting them.
2. Exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) is a technique used for initial access, which aligns with the scenario.
3. Before exploiting these applications, the actor would likely engage in some form of scanning to identify vulnerabilities.
4. Active scanning (T1595) is a broader technique that includes scanning for vulnerabilities, which would precede the exploitation.

**Final Answer**: B
