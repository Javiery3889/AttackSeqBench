To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Lazarus group executed a credential harvesting tool named Responder, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The Lazarus group used a credential harvesting tool named Responder. This tool is associated with LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay (T1557.001), which is a technique used for credential access. The goal here is to acquire login credentials, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gain information about the network or to extract sensitive data. While it can be used for credential access, it's not directly related to the use of Responder.
   - **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is directly related to the use of Responder, as it involves poisoning the LLMNR or NBT-NS protocol to redirect traffic and capture credentials. This is how Responder works, making it highly relevant to the initial action described.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding to evade detection. While encoding could be used at some point in an attack, it doesn't directly follow the execution of a credential harvesting tool.
   - **B & D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the target system. After acquiring credentials, an attacker might use these credentials to explore the system, making this a plausible next step.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**: This involves disguising as a legitimate process or user to evade detection. While masquerading could be a tactic used after credential acquisition, it's not as directly related to the next logical step of exploring the system as file and directory discovery is.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the Lazarus group has acquired login credentials using Responder, the next logical step would be to use those credentials to explore the system, which aligns with **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**. This technique would allow the attackers to understand the layout of the system, find valuable data, and plan their next moves.

**Final Answer: B**
