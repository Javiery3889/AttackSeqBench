To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred after Regin gathered information on processes and memory utilization and monitored network traffic for IIS web servers, before utilizing its RAT features for collection. This implies we are looking for a technique that fits within the context of discovery and preparation for further malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking indicators that might be used to detect the adversary, which doesn't directly relate to the initial stages of gathering information about the system or network.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, which could include details about the operating system, hardware, and configurations. This is relevant to understanding the environment.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique is about identifying the processes running on a system, which aligns with gathering information on processes and could be part of understanding what's running and how to proceed with further exploitation or evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the true source of traffic, which is more related to command and control (C2) communication rather than the initial information gathering phase.
   - **B: T1112-Modify Registry**: Modifying the registry can be used for persistence or to disable security features but doesn't directly relate to the initial phase of gathering system and network information.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture**: This involves capturing input (like keystrokes) from the user, which is more related to collecting specific data rather than the initial system and network reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the network connections and could logically follow the initial system and process discovery, as it helps in understanding the network layout and potential targets or paths for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that Regin has already gathered information on processes and memory utilization and monitored network traffic, the next logical step in its operation before utilizing its RAT features would be to understand the network connections available. This would help in planning the next stages of the attack, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** fits well as a follow-up action to the initial discovery of system information and process details, as it provides insight into how the system connects to the network and potentially to other systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context provided, would involve discovering system network connections after initial system and process discovery.

Final Answer: D
