To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for the technique that occurred before the initial access, which was achieved through spear-phishing. This implies we are looking for a preparatory or enabling technique that would facilitate or precede the spear-phishing attack.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are all under the "Initial Access" tactic, focusing on phishing techniques, including spear-phishing with links and attachments. This context suggests that the correct answer should be related to the preparation or execution of phishing attacks but does not directly involve the act of phishing itself since we're looking for something that happens before the initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1218.013-Mavinject**: This technique involves injecting code into a running process, which is more related to the execution or persistence phase rather than preparation for initial access.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the general technique of phishing, which includes the methods used for initial access but does not specify a preparatory step before phishing.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities that could be used in a cyber operation, such as creating or obtaining exploits, which could be a precursor to a phishing campaign by developing the necessary tools or infrastructure.
   - **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**: Obtaining digital certificates could be part of developing capabilities, especially for making phishing sites or emails appear more legitimate, but it's more specific and might not encompass the broader preparation needed before a phishing campaign.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique that precedes the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - The related TTPs focus on phishing for initial access.
   - The correct answer must be a technique that logically precedes or enables the phishing campaign.
   - **T1587-Develop Capabilities** fits this requirement as it involves the development or acquisition of tools, techniques, or infrastructure that could be used to support a phishing campaign, including creating weaponized documents or setting up malicious sites.

**Final Answer: C**
