To answer this question, let's break down the key elements described and match them with the provided ATT&CK techniques and related TTPs.

1. **Establishing persistence using a shortcut in the Windows startup folder**: This points towards the technique of achieving persistence, which is related to `T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder`. This is mentioned in the Related TTPs under the Persistence tactic.

2. **Evading defenses by detecting traces of virtualization or malware analysis tools**: This action is related to defense evasion, which is a tactic that includes techniques for evading detection. However, the specific technique mentioned in the Related TTPs under Defense Evasion is `T1218.010-Regsvr32`, but the description provided in the question more closely aligns with anti-analysis techniques, which are not directly listed but are a part of defense evasion tactics.

3. **Communication with the C&C server involving JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers**: This part of the question is crucial. The use of "dead drop resolvers" directly points to a technique under the Command and Control tactic. Specifically, `T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver` is mentioned in the Related TTPs, which involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. The mention of JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services further supports this, as it describes a method of hiding C2 communication within seemingly legitimate traffic.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's desktop. It does not relate to the communication methods or evasion techniques described in the question.

- **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This involves using DNS queries to perform calculations, which could be a part of C2 communication but does not directly match the description of using dead drop resolvers and JSON-encoded objects.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**: While this technique involves using web services for C2 communication, it's broader than what's described. The specific use of dead drop resolvers points to a more specific technique under this category.

- **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names for C2 communication. While it's related to C2, the specific mention of dead drop resolvers in the question aligns more closely with `T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver`, but since this exact technique is not listed as an answer choice, we must choose the closest match based on the provided options.

Given the emphasis on dead drop resolvers and the context provided by the Related TTPs, the closest match in the answer choices that aligns with the use of dead drop resolvers for C2 communication is not directly listed, but `T1102-Web Service` is the closest in terms of C2 communication techniques provided in the options. However, the question's description most closely aligns with the concept of using dead drop resolvers as described in `T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver`, which is a sub-technique of `T1102-Web Service`. Since `T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver` is not an option but is closely related to `T1102-Web Service`, and considering the provided options:

Final Answer: C
