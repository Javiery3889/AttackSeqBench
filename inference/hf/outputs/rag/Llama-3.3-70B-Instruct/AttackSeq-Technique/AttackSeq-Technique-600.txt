To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and sets up legitimate external websites as Command and Control (C2) servers. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that would most likely occur to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point and establish contact with the C2 servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Command and Control, specifically techniques T1090 (Proxy) and T1090.002 (External Proxy). These techniques are about using proxies to hide the true source of traffic, which aligns with the use of Ngrok and external websites as C2 servers mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**: This technique involves reducing the key space to make it easier to guess or crack passwords, which doesn't directly relate to compiling binary files or establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Using non-standard ports could be a part of evading detection, but it doesn't directly address compiling binary files from decoded snippets.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to hide its content, which could be relevant to decoding snippets and could be part of the process of communicating with C2 servers, especially if the communication involves encoded commands or data.
   - **D: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: Modifying the authentication process is more about altering how users are authenticated, which doesn't directly relate to compiling binary files or establishing contact with C2 servers.

Given the context of compiling binary files from decoded snippets and establishing contact with C2 servers, the most relevant technique seems to be **C: T1132-Data Encoding**. This is because data encoding can be used to hide the true nature of the communication (including commands or data sent to or from the C2 server) and could be involved in the process of decoding snippets to compile binary files.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the goal: Determine the ATT&CK technique for compiling binary files and establishing C2 contact.
2. Analyze the use of proxy tools and external C2 servers.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the context of compiling binary files and C2 communication.
4. Select the technique that best aligns with encoding and decoding data for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: C**
