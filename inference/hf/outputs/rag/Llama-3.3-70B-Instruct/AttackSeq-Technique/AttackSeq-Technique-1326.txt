To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after CosmicDuke utilized a keylogger and a screenshotter for gathering user activity information, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of a keylogger and a screenshotter by CosmicDuke for gathering user activity information. This implies that the attacker is in the phase of collecting data from the compromised system. Keyloggers and screenshotters are typically used to capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other confidential data that a user might type or view on their computer.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This indicates that the attacker is using keylogging as a method to collect data. Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can reveal sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This shows that keylogging is also used for credential access, implying that the attacker is interested in obtaining login credentials or other sensitive information that can be used to access systems or data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. Given that the attacker has already collected data using keyloggers and screenshotters, the next logical step could be to exfiltrate this collected data.
   - **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves modifying or extending the functionality of a network provider to intercept or modify network traffic. While this could be a part of an attack, it doesn't directly follow the collection of user activity information as closely as exfiltration does.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: Archiving collected data is a plausible step after collection, as it involves organizing the data for potential future use or exfiltration. However, the question seems to imply a step that follows the collection and potentially prepares the data for removal from the system.
   - **D: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard. While it's another form of data collection, it doesn't necessarily follow the use of keyloggers and screenshotters in a sequence aimed at exfiltrating collected data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of keyloggers and screenshotters indicates the attacker is collecting sensitive information.
   - The next logical step after collecting this information would be to either store it for later use, exfiltrate it, or use it for further malicious activities.
   - Among the given options, **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** directly follows the collection of data as it involves the automatic transfer of the collected data from the victim's system to the attacker's system or a controlled server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after utilizing a keylogger and a screenshotter for gathering user activity information would involve exfiltrating the collected data.

Final Answer: A
