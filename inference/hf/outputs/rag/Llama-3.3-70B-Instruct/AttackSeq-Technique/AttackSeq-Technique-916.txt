To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Tuyul malware executed Perl scripts and shell commands, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exploitation of a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) and the subsequent execution of Perl scripts and shell commands by the Tuyul malware. This indicates a sequence of actions where an initial exploitation is followed by the execution of commands or scripts on the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Given that the Tuyul malware executed Perl scripts and shell commands, this technique is directly relevant to the actions described after the exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges. While relevant to post-exploitation activities, it's more about escalating privileges rather than the initial exploitation or execution of scripts.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is the technique used by the Tuyul malware after the exploitation. It doesn't describe the action before the execution of scripts.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. It's not directly related to the exploitation or the execution of scripts as described.
   - **C: T1587.004-Exploits**: This sub-technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software. Given that the Tuyul malware exploited a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841), this technique directly precedes the execution of Perl scripts and shell commands.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This sub-technique involves using systemd timers for persistence. It's not directly related to the initial exploitation or the execution of scripts as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the Tuyul malware executed scripts and commands.
   - The exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2017-9841) is a clear precursor to the execution of scripts and commands.
   - **T1587.004-Exploits** directly relates to exploiting vulnerabilities, which is what happened before the execution of scripts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with exploiting a vulnerability, which aligns with **C: T1587.004-Exploits**.

Final Answer: C
