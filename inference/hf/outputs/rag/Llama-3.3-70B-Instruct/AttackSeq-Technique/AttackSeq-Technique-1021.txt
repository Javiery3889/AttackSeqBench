To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents on a compromised system. Following this, Gamaredon sends emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. The focus here is on the action of sending emails with malicious attachments to compromise other targets internally.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTP provided is T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment, which is categorized under the Initial Access tactic. This technique involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content to gain initial access to a system. However, the question specifically mentions sending emails to "other targets within the same organization," which suggests an internal targeting effort after initial access has been gained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver**: This technique involves using a screensaver to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code. While it could be related to the broader context of exploiting user interaction, it doesn't specifically match the action of sending internal emails with malicious attachments.
   - **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**: This technique involves using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute code. It doesn't directly relate to the scenario of sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique specifically involves sending spearphishing emails to targets within the same organization, aiming to trick them into performing certain actions or gaining access to their systems. Given that the initial access has been achieved and the focus is on targeting other internal targets via email, this technique aligns closely with the described scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now attempting to expand their reach within the organization.
   - The action of sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization is a form of spearphishing targeted internally.
   - T1534-Internal Spearphishing directly addresses this tactic of targeting internal users via spearphishing emails.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is internal spearphishing.

Final Answer: D
