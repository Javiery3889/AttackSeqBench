To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used to establish communication with the command and control (C2) server at 160.20.147.254 after concealing malware, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions concealing malware through defense evasion methods and then establishing communication with a C2 server. This implies the attacker has already evaded detection and is now looking to communicate with the C2 server, possibly using methods that avoid common detection mechanisms.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This involves using DNS as a means of communication with the C2 server. However, the question does not specifically mention DNS.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves using a series of packets sent to specific closed ports to trigger a response, which could be a way to evade detection but is more about evading detection rather than establishing C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection, which aligns with the goal of establishing C2 communication without being detected.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This involves disguising the communication to look like it's coming from a legitimate protocol or service, which could be a method to evade detection but doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 communication as described.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique is about using shared modules of code across different tools, which doesn't directly relate to the act of establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1505.002-Transport Agent**: This involves using a transport agent to relay communications, which could be relevant but is less directly related to the specific action of communicating with a C2 server at a specified IP address.
   - **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Given the context of trying to establish communication with a C2 server without being detected, using a non-standard port is a plausible method to achieve this, especially considering the provided related TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on establishing communication with a C2 server after evading detection.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques related to command and control and defense evasion.
   - Among the answer choices, using a non-standard port (T1571) is a common method for establishing C2 communication while trying to avoid detection, aligning with the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D
