To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after T9000 executed malicious functionality through DLL sideloading using igfxtray.exe but before it customized its installation to evade 24 identified security products, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already used DLL sideloading (a technique associated with Defense Evasion) to execute malicious functionality. This is followed by an action to customize the installation to evade a significant number of security products. We need to find the technique that most likely fits between these two actions in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to identify what security software is installed on the system. This could be a precursor to evading those security products.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is the technique already used by the attacker to execute malicious code, as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attacker has already used DLL sideloading (T1574.002) and is looking to customize the installation to evade security products, the next logical step would involve understanding what security products are present on the system to effectively evade them.
   - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery** fits this scenario perfectly because it involves identifying security software, which would be necessary before customizing the installation to evade those products.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules** (Answer Choice A) is about using shared modules, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of evading security products.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** (Answer Choice B) involves hiding artifacts, which could be part of evasion but doesn't directly relate to discovering security software before evasion.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection** (Answer Choice C) is about collecting data automatically, which doesn't fit the context of evading security products.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** (Answer Choice D) involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is specific and doesn't directly relate to the broad evasion of 24 identified security products mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has used DLL sideloading to execute malicious code.
   - The next logical step before customizing the installation to evade security products would be to identify what security products are present.
   - **T1518.001-Security Software Discovery** is the technique that aligns with this step.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after DLL sideloading, the attacker would engage in security software discovery to inform how to evade those products.

Final Answer: B
