To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the SLUB backdoor was used to collect data from the victim's system, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after performing discovery and gathering system information, the SLUB backdoor was used. This implies that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now in the phase of collecting more specific data or maintaining access.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics and techniques used are focused on discovery. Specifically, T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery) are mentioned. These techniques are about gathering information on the system's network configuration and general system information, respectively.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. While it's a method for collecting sensitive data, it's more focused on credential theft rather than the broad collection of data that might be implied by the use of a backdoor like SLUB.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is related to network attacks aimed at capturing hashes or authenticating to a system. It doesn't directly relate to the use of a backdoor for data collection.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves disabling or impairing security controls to make the system more vulnerable. While using a backdoor could be part of impairing defenses, the question seems to focus on the action taken after the backdoor is used, rather than the act of using the backdoor itself to impair defenses.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system, which could be a method for collecting data once access has been gained, such as through a backdoor.

Given the context that the SLUB backdoor is being used to collect data and considering the discovery phase has already occurred (as indicated by the related TTPs), the most plausible next step in terms of collecting specific, potentially sensitive data from the victim's system would be to capture the screen. This directly aligns with the goal of collecting data and fits the scenario of using a backdoor for malicious purposes beyond just initial system discovery.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attacker has already performed discovery.
2. The SLUB backdoor is used for further malicious activity.
3. The goal is to collect data from the victim's system.
4. Among the options, screen capture directly relates to collecting data that could be of interest to an attacker.

**Final Answer**: D
