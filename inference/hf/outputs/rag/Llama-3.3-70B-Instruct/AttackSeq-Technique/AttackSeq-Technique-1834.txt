To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using obfuscation and dynamic code invocation to evade detection, the callCam app collected extensive data. This implies that the attacker had already gained access to the system or device and was now in the phase of gathering information.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This suggests that the attacker is interested in automatically exfiltrating data from the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This indicates the attacker's use of obfuscation to evade detection, which aligns with the mention of obfuscation and dynamic code invocation in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique involves using cloud accounts for persistence or other malicious purposes. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the collection of device and application information.
   - **B: T1564.003-Hidden Window**: This technique involves hiding windows to conceal malicious activity, which could be related to evading detection but doesn't directly precede data collection in a logical attack sequence.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, which aligns with the collection of device information, location, and application data mentioned in the question. It's a logical step before exfiltrating data, as understanding the system and its components is crucial for targeted data collection.
   - **D: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique is about exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges, which might be necessary for certain types of data collection but doesn't directly relate to the act of collecting system and application information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after evading detection, collects extensive data from a device.
   - The related TTPs suggest a focus on evading detection and exfiltrating data automatically.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1082-System Information Discovery** is the most directly related to the action of collecting device information, location, and application data.
   - Therefore, it is logical that before the callCam app collected this data, the attacker would first need to discover what information is available on the system, making **C: T1082-System Information Discovery** the most plausible technique to have occurred before the data collection.

Final Answer: C
