To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an obfuscated JavaScript payload, executed by VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro functions, communicates with a specific IP address. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the adversary's entry into the target system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Execution) and a technique (T1059.005-Visual Basic), which is a subset of the "Execution" tactic. This indicates that the initial compromise likely involved executing malicious code, potentially through Office applications like Microsoft Excel or Word, which support VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common initial access technique where adversaries trick users into performing certain actions or revealing sensitive information. Given that the scenario involves VBA macros (which are often distributed through phishing emails as malicious document attachments), this seems like a plausible entry point.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This involves compromising a supplier or third-party vendor to gain access to a target organization. While possible, there's no direct indication in the scenario that the compromise was through a supply chain attack.
   - **C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order of DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) to load malicious code. While it's an execution technique, it doesn't directly relate to the initial entry method described.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to detect. While the payload is obfuscated, this technique doesn't describe how the adversary initially gained access to the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves an obfuscated JavaScript payload executed by VBA macro functions, indicating the malicious code was likely delivered through a document that the user opened.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of VBA, which is commonly exploited through phishing emails containing malicious Office documents.
   - Given these points, the most likely initial access technique is phishing, as it aligns with the common distribution method of VBA macro-enabled documents.

Final Answer: A
