To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described for Regin, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers for managing payloads. This indicates a method used by the attackers to hide or protect their tools and data, which falls under defense evasion tactics. After this, the attackers steal credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings, which is a credential access tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes**: This technique involves modifying file attributes to hide files, which is a method of defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This involves stealing credentials from web browsers, aligning with the action of stealing credentials from Internet Explorer.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves using encryption or encoding to hide or protect files, which aligns with the use of EVFS containers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering files and directories on the system. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions described (using EVFS and stealing credentials).
   - **B: T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique is about using a hidden file system, which could be related to the use of EVFS containers but doesn't directly fit the sequence of using EVFS and then stealing credentials.
   - **C: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the Rundll32 utility to execute malicious code. It's a method of executing payloads, which could fit between the deployment of EVFS containers and the act of stealing credentials, as it involves executing code that could be used for various purposes, including credential theft.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This is a broader technique that involves hiding artifacts, which could include files, directories, or network activity. While related to defense evasion, it's too broad and doesn't specifically fit the sequence as well as another option might.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the use of EVFS containers, which is a method of defense evasion, specifically to manage payloads.
   - The next action is stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings, which is a credential access tactic.
   - Given the related TTPs and the need for a technique that could plausibly occur after deploying EVFS containers and before stealing credentials, **T1218.011-Rundll32** stands out. This is because executing code (potentially to prepare for or facilitate credential theft) using Rundll32 could logically follow the deployment of EVFS containers and precede the actual act of stealing credentials.

**Final Answer: C**
