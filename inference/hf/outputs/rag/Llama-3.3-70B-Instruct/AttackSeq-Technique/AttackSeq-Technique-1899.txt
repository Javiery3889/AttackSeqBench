To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after TeamTNT compromised the exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access and led to the deployment and execution of the coin miner payload, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, TeamTNT, gains initial access through an exposed Weave Scope service. This initial access leads to the deployment and execution of a coin miner payload. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this initial access and resulted in the execution of the payload.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1569-System Services**: This suggests that system services are being utilized for execution, which could be relevant after initial access for running the coin miner.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This indicates that external remote services are used for gaining initial access, which aligns with the exposed Weave Scope service being exploited.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This shows that the same technique used for initial access is also considered for persistence, implying ongoing access and potential for further malicious activity like deploying payloads.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1648-Serverless Execution**: While serverless execution could be a method for executing payloads, there's no direct indication in the related TTPs that this is the primary method used after initial access for deploying and executing the coin miner.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. Given that the attackers have gained initial access and are looking to deploy and execute a payload, using a command and scripting interpreter is a plausible next step for executing the coin miner.
   - **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This technique involves executing code in the memory of a process. While it's a method for executing payloads, the question and related TTPs do not specifically suggest memory-based execution as the immediate next step after initial access.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**: Active scanning is more related to reconnaissance and does not directly relate to the execution of a payload after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers gained initial access through an exposed service (T1133-External Remote Services).
   - The goal is to execute a coin miner payload, which requires some form of execution technique post-access.
   - Among the provided options, **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is the most directly related to executing scripts or commands, which could include deploying and running a coin miner payload.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after initial access, given the goal of executing a payload, involves using a command and scripting interpreter.

Final Answer: B
