To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have used keylogging to gain administrator passwords and are now using writable mass storage devices (like USB drives) for infection to spread across the network. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers utilized this method of spreading.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Lateral Movement" and "Initial Access" tactics, both of which involve the technique T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media. This technique is directly related to the use of USB drives for spreading malware. Additionally, there's a mention of "Exfiltration" using T1052.001 - Exfiltration over USB, which, while relevant to USB usage, is more about data exfiltration than the initial spread of malware.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions, which could be a method for lateral movement but doesn't directly relate to the initial use of keylogging and subsequent USB-based spreading.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2), which could be part of the attack but doesn't directly precede the use of USB for spreading.
   - **C: T1216.001-PubPrn**: This technique is not directly related to the described scenario of using keylogging and then spreading via USB.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting services to gain access or move laterally within a network. Given that the attackers have gained administrator passwords via keylogging, exploiting remote services could be a plausible step before using those credentials to spread malware via USB drives, as it aligns with using gained credentials for further network access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first gained administrator passwords through keylogging.
   - With these credentials, they would need a method to access the network or systems to then use the USB drives for spreading malware.
   - Exploiting remote services (T1210) with the gained credentials would provide them the necessary access to the network, allowing them to then use USB drives for malware spread.
   - Therefore, exploiting remote services is the most logical step before utilizing USB infection for network spread.

Final Answer: D
