To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Regin utilized its collection capabilities, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions Regin, a sophisticated malware known for its espionage capabilities, including capturing screenshots, stealing passwords, and crawling the file system. These activities are all part of the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the target.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the "Collection" tactic and the technique "T1113-Screen Capture." This technique is directly related to one of the capabilities mentioned for Regin (capturing screenshots), reinforcing that the context is about collecting data from the target system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to indirect command and control (C2) communications. After collecting data, an attacker might need to exfiltrate the data or maintain access, which could involve setting up a proxy for C2 communications to avoid detection.
   - **B: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This is a sub-technique of proxying where the attacker uses different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS handshake and the HTTP Host header to disguise the true destination of the C2 traffic. While related to proxying, it's more specific to evading detection by domain name inspection.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules of code across different malware tools or campaigns. While it could be relevant in the broader context of malware operations, it doesn't directly follow from the collection activities described.
   - **D: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**: This involves duplicating network traffic to make it appear as though the traffic is coming from a different source. It's not directly related to the typical next steps after data collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on what happens after data collection.
   - The collection capabilities of Regin (e.g., screen capture, password stealing, file system crawling) are aimed at gathering sensitive information.
   - After collecting data, the next logical step for an attacker would be to exfiltrate the data or maintain access for further collection, which often involves establishing or utilizing command and control channels.
   - Among the provided options, setting up a proxy (T1090) is a common method for hiding the C2 channel, making it a plausible next step after collection.

**Final Answer: A**
