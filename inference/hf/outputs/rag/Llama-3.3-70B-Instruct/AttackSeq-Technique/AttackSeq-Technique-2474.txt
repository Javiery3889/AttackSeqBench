To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attack remains undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts to exfiltrate stolen credentials to an FTP server. This implies the attacker is trying to blend in with normal network activity to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique involves using code signing to make malicious code appear legitimate.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data over non-command and control (C2) protocols that are not encrypted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which doesn't directly relate to evading detection by using legitimate tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising tools, scripts, or other artifacts to make them appear as something else, which aligns with using legitimate tools to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053.002-At**: This is a scheduled task/command technique, which doesn't directly relate to the use of legitimate tools for evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts to access systems, which, while relevant to the use of legitimate means, doesn't directly address the evasion aspect through masquerading as legitimate activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the attacker's ability to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under Defense Evasion and Exfiltration, indicating the importance of evading detection during the exfiltration process.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1036-Masquerading** is the technique that most directly enables an attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors. This is because masquerading involves making malicious activity appear as legitimate, which aligns with the scenario described.

Final Answer: B
