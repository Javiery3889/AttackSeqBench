To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique likely used by the Lazarus group to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. This implies we are looking for a technique related to gathering information about the targets before the phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Initial Access and include techniques T1566 (Phishing) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment). These are directly related to the method of initial access mentioned in the question (spear-phishing emails). However, the question asks about the preparation phase before the phishing attack, indicating we need to look for a technique that involves gathering information or preparing the ground for the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from files. While credential gathering is a crucial aspect of many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to preparing or targeting specific individuals before a phishing campaign.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the intended victims, which could include names, positions, contact information, etc. This would be highly relevant for crafting targeted spear-phishing emails, as it allows the attackers to personalize the emails, increasing the likelihood of success.
   - **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique is about scanning IP blocks to gather information about the target's network infrastructure. While useful for some types of attacks, it doesn't directly contribute to targeting specific individuals within an organization.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malware or other tools. It's more related to the post-exploitation phase rather than the preparation phase for targeting individuals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about preparing and targeting specific individuals before a spear-phishing attack.
   - The most relevant technique to this preparation phase, especially for targeting, involves gathering information about the victims.
   - Among the provided options, **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the technique that best aligns with the preparation needed for a targeted spear-phishing campaign.

Final Answer: B
