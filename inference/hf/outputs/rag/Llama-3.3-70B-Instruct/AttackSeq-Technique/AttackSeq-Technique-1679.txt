To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already used Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping and have cleared log files to conceal their activity. They then execute processes on remote computers to propagate across the network. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this propagation phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This indicates the movement from one system to another within the network, often involving the transfer of tools to facilitate further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This is about evading detection by clearing logs, which aligns with the "clearing log files" part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which aligns with the "credential dumping" part of the question using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question specifically mentions executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network. This action is directly related to moving laterally within the network.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** (Answer Choice C) involves using remote services to execute commands on remote systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** (Related TTP) supports the idea of moving tools or payloads across the network, which could be part of the lateral movement but is more specific to transferring tools.
   - **T1583.004-Server** does not directly relate to the execution of processes on remote computers for propagation.
   - **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact** and **T1080-Taint Shared Content** do not directly relate to the execution of processes for network propagation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already performed credential dumping and log clearing, indicating they are past the initial access and defense evasion stages.
   - They are now executing processes on remote computers, which is a clear indication of lateral movement.
   - The most relevant technique for executing processes on remote computers as part of lateral movement is **T1021-Remote Services**.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the attackers executed processes on remote computers to propagate across the network is **T1021-Remote Services**.

Final Answer: C
