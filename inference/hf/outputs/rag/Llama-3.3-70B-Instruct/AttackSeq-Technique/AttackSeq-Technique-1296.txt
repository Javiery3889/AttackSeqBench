To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises were used to gain access, resulting in customized Poison Ivy server code being executed on the target system, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial access vector involving spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises, leading to the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code on the target system. This implies that the initial access tactic has already been successful, and the attacker has managed to execute malicious code on the target system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic "Initial Access" and include techniques T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. These are methods used by attackers to initially gain access to a system, which aligns with the initial phase described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**: This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for lateral movement or to establish a foothold within a network. While it could be a subsequent action after initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the execution of customized malware like Poison Ivy.
   - **B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship between the victim and a third party to gain access or influence. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of malware on a system after initial access.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code in response to specific events or conditions. Given that Poison Ivy is a type of remote access tool (RAT) that can be customized and executed on a compromised system, the execution of such malware could indeed be triggered by specific events or conditions, making this a plausible next step after initial access.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for the initial access as described in the question and related TTPs. It's not what happens after the initial access but rather the method of gaining that initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely to occur after initial access has been gained through methods like spear-phishing, resulting in the execution of customized malware.
   - The execution of customized Poison Ivy server code indicates that the attacker has already gained access and is now looking to establish a persistent presence or execute further malicious actions.
   - Among the provided options, **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** is the most relevant to the scenario where customized malware (like Poison Ivy) is executed on the target system as a result of specific conditions or events, which could be part of establishing a foothold or maintaining persistence.

Final Answer: C
