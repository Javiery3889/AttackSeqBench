To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Babar's dropper reduces forensic artifacts, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a dropper, after executing, attempts to reduce forensic artifacts by deleting its own binary from the disk. This action is specifically aimed at evasion, making it harder for defenders to detect or analyze the malware.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Defense Evasion) and a technique (T1070.004-File Deletion). This indicates that the focus is on the malware's attempt to evade detection, specifically through the deletion of files.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1555.001-Keychain**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from keychain. It doesn't directly relate to the action of deleting files or reducing forensic artifacts as described.
   - **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing a process in response to an event. While it could be related to the execution of the cmd.exe process, it doesn't directly address the reduction of forensic artifacts.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding artifacts, which aligns with the action of deleting the dropper binary to reduce forensic evidence. However, the specific action described (deleting a file) is more closely related to file deletion.
   - **D: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves smuggling malicious code through HTML files. It doesn't directly relate to the deletion of files or the specific action of reducing forensic artifacts by executing a command line to delete the dropper binary.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action described involves a dropper taking steps to reduce its visibility on the system by deleting its own binary.
   - The related TTPs highlight Defense Evasion and file deletion, indicating the focus is on evading detection.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1564-Hide Artifacts** is the most relevant to the tactic of reducing forensic artifacts, even though the specific technique of file deletion (T1070.004) is mentioned as a related TTP. The question asks for the technique that "most likely occurred before" the file deletion, suggesting we're looking for an action that precedes the deletion in the context of evasion.

**Final Answer: C**
