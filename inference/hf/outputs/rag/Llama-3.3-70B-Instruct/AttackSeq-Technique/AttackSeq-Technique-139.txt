To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically APT-TOCS, has already downloaded Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell. This indicates the attacker is using scripting for their operations, possibly for command and control (C2) purposes. The mention of maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion suggests the attacker is using techniques to avoid detection, possibly by varying their communication patterns. The goal is to establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Command and Control, which aligns with the context of establishing communication for C2 purposes. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communications, which fits the description of using HTTP GET requests.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the C2 channel, which aligns with the mention of multi-beacon communication for evasion.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves collecting log data from various sources, which does not directly relate to establishing secure communication.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: While PowerShell is a scripting interpreter and its use is mentioned, this choice doesn't directly address the establishment of secure communication via HTTP GET requests.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This involves using symmetric encryption, which could be part of securing communication but doesn't directly relate to the use of HTTP GET requests for C2.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel could involve using HTTPS (a form of encrypted web protocol) for secure communication, which aligns with using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs for C2 purposes, especially in the context of T1071.001 and the goal of secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario focused on establishing secure communication for command and control purposes.
   - The use of HTTP GET requests to specific URLs suggests the involvement of web protocols for C2.
   - Given the context of secure communication and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique is one that involves securing the communication channel.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly addresses the need for secure communication, which can be achieved through encrypted web protocols (like HTTPS), fitting the scenario described.

Final Answer: D
