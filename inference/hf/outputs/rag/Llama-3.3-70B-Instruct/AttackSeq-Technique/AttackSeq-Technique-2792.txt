To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already compromised an iOS device and is now looking to facilitate communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. The communication involves using POST and GET requests, which are common HTTP methods used for sending and receiving data over the internet. The goal here is to identify the ATT&CK technique that best aligns with this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates the attacker's interest in exfiltrating (transferring out) data from the compromised device to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**: This suggests the attacker is gathering information about the Wi-Fi environment, which could be part of the initial compromise or for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. While it could be used in the context of network exploitation, it doesn't directly relate to communicating with a C2 server using HTTP requests.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication. Given the context of using POST and GET requests, which are standard methods for interacting with web services, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique is about discovering software on a system. While discovery is part of the attack process, it doesn't directly relate to the communication method described.
   - **D: T1001.001-Junk Data**: This involves inserting junk data to hinder analysis. It doesn't fit the scenario of communicating with a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used for communication with a C2 server after compromising a device.
   - The use of POST and GET requests points towards web-based communication.
   - Among the given options, **T1102-Web Service** is the technique that directly involves using web services, which aligns with the use of HTTP requests for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using web services for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
