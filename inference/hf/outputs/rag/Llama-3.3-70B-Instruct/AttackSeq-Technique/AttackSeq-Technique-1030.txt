To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after establishing command and control (C2) using HTTP and HTTPS, Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server. The focus here is on the action of uploading harvested documents back to the C2 server, which is a key aspect of data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
   These TTPs indicate that the attack involves exfiltrating data and that this exfiltration is automated and occurs over the established C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves restricting the size of data transfers to avoid detection, which doesn't directly relate to the action of uploading harvested documents.
   - **B: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This involves using add-ins (like Microsoft Office add-ins) for persistence or execution, not directly related to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario of uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be part of the process but doesn't specifically describe exfiltration over a C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server, which is a clear indication of exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration tactics and techniques, particularly focusing on automated exfiltration and exfiltration over C2 channels.
   - Given the context, the most relevant technique to the described action is exfiltrating data over the established command and control channel.
   
Final Answer: C
