To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control server after NewsBeef used obfuscated JavaScript injection, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of obfuscated JavaScript injection for evasion and maintaining server persistence. It specifically asks about the technique that facilitated communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control server. This implies we are looking for a technique related to command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the destination of the C2 traffic. It's relevant to hiding the communication paths.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This involves making data unreadable to prevent detection. It's about hiding the content of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This is about disguising files or information to avoid detection, which aligns with the initial obfuscated JavaScript injection mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This is a specific protocol used for transferring files, which might not directly relate to the general communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This involves compromising the supply chain to gain access to a target, which doesn't directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which could be relevant as it encompasses a broad range of protocols that could be used for communication between a backdoor and a C2 server, including potentially those that are obfuscated or multi-staged.
   - **D: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**: This is a technique related to hijacking dynamic libraries on macOS systems, which doesn't directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique to facilitating communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control server, especially considering the use of obfuscation and the need for command and control, would be **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This is because it directly relates to the use of protocols for C2 communication, which can include obfuscated or multi-staged channels as hinted at by the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: C**
