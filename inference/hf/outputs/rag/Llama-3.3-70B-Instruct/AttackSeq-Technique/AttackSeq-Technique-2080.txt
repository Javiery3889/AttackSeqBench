To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial access vector through Drive-by Compromise, which leads to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script for fetching malware. The focus here is on the technique used to execute the PowerShell script after the initial access has been gained.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. This indicates the use of PowerShell for executing commands or scripts.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise. This is the method by which initial access to the system is gained, through compromising a user's system by exploiting a vulnerability when they visit a compromised website or click on a malicious ad.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute scripts during PowerShell initialization. While it's a method to execute PowerShell scripts, it's more about persistence and not directly related to the immediate execution of a script post-initial access.
   - **B: T1053.003-Cron**: This involves using cron jobs for scheduled execution of commands, which is not directly related to the immediate execution of PowerShell scripts in the context provided.
   - **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique is about obtaining software or tools that can be used to support operations. While relevant in a broader context of an attack, it doesn't directly address the execution of a PowerShell script.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Given that T1059.001-PowerShell is a sub-technique under this category, it directly relates to executing PowerShell scripts, which aligns with the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script post-initial access.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of PowerShell for execution.
   - Among the answer choices, **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is the most relevant because it directly pertains to the use of PowerShell (or any command and scripting interpreter) to execute scripts, which is what's described in the scenario.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique to execute the PowerShell script after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: D
