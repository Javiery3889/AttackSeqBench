To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has performed DLL sideloading using `igfxtray.exe` and is looking to ensure that T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned after a system reboot. DLL sideloading is a technique used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, and in this context, it's used to execute a payload.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Persistence**, **Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves loading a DLL into all processes that are user-mode by adding it to the list of AppInit DLLs. This would allow the malicious DLL to be loaded into every user-mode process.
   - **Tactic: Persistence**, **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is the technique used in the initial step of the attack, where a malicious DLL is loaded into a legitimate process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is used to evade detection in virtualized or sandbox environments, which doesn't directly relate to ensuring components run with every user mode process after reboot.
   - **B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This involves renaming system utilities to evade detection or to make them seem legitimate, which doesn't directly ensure persistence across reboots for all user-mode processes.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon. While it does relate to persistence, it's broader and doesn't specifically ensure loading with every user-mode process.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be used for persistence but doesn't specifically address loading a DLL into every user-mode process.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique for ensuring T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot, after performing DLL sideloading, is related to persistence mechanisms that specifically target user-mode processes. The technique of using **AppInit DLLs (T1546.010)** is directly relevant as it allows a DLL to be loaded into all user-mode processes, which aligns with the goal described in the question.

However, since **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs** is not listed as an answer choice, we need to select the answer that best aligns with the goal of achieving persistence across all user-mode processes after a reboot. Among the provided choices, **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the closest in terms of achieving persistence, as it involves executing code at boot or logon, which could potentially include mechanisms to load a DLL into all user-mode processes, even though it's not as specific as AppInit DLLs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
1. The question asks for a technique to ensure T9000's components run with every user-mode process after a reboot.
2. DLL sideloading is used initially, indicating a need for persistence.
3. Related TTPs highlight persistence techniques, specifically mentioning AppInit DLLs, which directly achieves the desired outcome but isn't an answer choice.
4. Among the answer choices, the one that best aligns with persistence across all user-mode processes after reboot, considering typical attack sequences, is **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**, as it can encompass mechanisms for loading DLLs into all user-mode processes at system start or user logon.

**Final Answer: C**
