To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and ensured detection was evaded by deleting itself post-execution, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an obfuscated VBS script is executed using 'wscript.exe', and to evade detection, the script deletes itself after execution. This indicates a focus on evasion techniques to avoid being detected by security measures.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the "Defense Evasion" tactic, which aligns with the script's behavior of deleting itself to avoid detection. Specifically, T1070.004 (File Deletion) is mentioned, which directly relates to the action of deleting files (in this case, the script itself) to evade detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to establish a command and control channel, which does not directly relate to the evasion technique described.
   - **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This involves using a combination of identities to authenticate, which does not align with the scenario of a script deleting itself.
   - **C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**: This technique is about re-opening applications to maintain access, not directly related to evading detection through file deletion.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which can include file deletion as a means to hide evidence of malicious activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the deletion of the script post-execution to evade detection, which points towards techniques under the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - T1070.004 (File Deletion) is directly related to the action described, but we need to choose the best answer from the provided options.
   - Among the options, **T1564-Hide Artifacts** is the most relevant because it encompasses the broader tactic of hiding evidence (including file deletion) to avoid detection, which aligns with the script's behavior.

**Final Answer: D**
