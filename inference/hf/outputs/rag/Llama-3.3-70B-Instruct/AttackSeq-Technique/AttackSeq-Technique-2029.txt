To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files for operational control, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Duke group's actions, which include collecting detailed bot/system information and using Seaduke for updating bot configurations and uploading files. This implies that the group is in the phase of establishing or maintaining control over compromised systems and possibly preparing for further malicious activities such as data exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This suggests the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial actions of the Duke group in collecting bot/system information.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools or files into the compromised system, which is consistent with the group's use of Seaduke to upload files for operational control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**: This technique involves using TFTP to boot a system, which doesn't directly follow from the described actions focused on data collection and system control.
   - **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**: This involves collecting data from a configuration repository, which could be a step after establishing control but doesn't directly relate to the use of Seaduke for updating configurations and uploading files.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique is about using a multi-hop proxy for command and control, which could be a method used after establishing initial control to maintain stealth and operational security.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**: This involves encoding data to avoid detection, which could be a step in preparing data for exfiltration after it has been collected and the system is under control.

Given the context of the Duke group's actions (collecting information, updating configurations, and uploading files for operational control), the next logical step would involve either further consolidating control, exfiltrating data, or maintaining stealth. Among the provided options, **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** seems the most plausible as a next step for maintaining command and control while avoiding detection, especially since the group has already established a means of operational control through Seaduke.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The Duke group has established control and is likely looking to maintain or expand this control.
2. The use of Seaduke for updating configurations and uploading files indicates a need for reliable and potentially stealthy command and control.
3. Among the provided options, the technique that best aligns with maintaining stealthy command and control is the use of a multi-hop proxy.

**Final Answer**: C
