To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary copied results from the discovery phase. This phase includes gathering information such as file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes. The adversary is preparing to exfiltrate data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
   These TTPs indicate that the adversary is in the process of collecting data and has already performed discovery activities to understand the target environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email from a mailbox or email server. While it could be part of the collection process, it's not directly implied as the next step after copying results from the discovery phase, which includes a broader range of information than just emails.
   - **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique is not directly related to the collection of data for exfiltration but rather involves modifying shared content to compromise systems or data.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from a network shared drive, which aligns with the discovery of remote system shares mentioned in the question. It's a plausible next step after the discovery phase, especially since the adversary has identified shared drives and is preparing for data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service to gain access or control, which doesn't directly relate to the act of collecting data after the discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after the discovery phase, which includes copying file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.
   - The related TTPs highlight the tactics of collection and discovery, with a specific technique (T1083) related to file and directory discovery.
   - Given the context, the most relevant technique that would occur after the discovery phase, especially considering the preparation for data exfiltration, is collecting data from identified sources such as network shared drives.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after copying results from the discovery phase is related to collecting data from network shared drives.

Final Answer: C
