To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Carbanak conducted reconnaissance but before they downloaded and executed new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by Carbanak, starting with reconnaissance focused on banking applications and internal procedures. This is followed by an unspecified action, and then the downloading and execution of new payloads for lateral movement. The question asks us to identify the technique that most likely occurred between these two phases.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This indicates the initial phase of gathering information about the victim's network, which aligns with the reconnaissance mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This is related to the later phase of moving laterally within the infrastructure, which involves transferring tools to facilitate movement.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system, which could be part of the reconnaissance or preparation for further actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of a target organization, which doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to gain initial access or gather credentials but doesn't directly relate to the actions described after reconnaissance and before lateral movement.
   - **C: T1584.005-Botnet**: This involves using a botnet, which is not directly implied in the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which could be a logical step after reconnaissance to prepare for lateral movement. It would provide the necessary credentials to move laterally within the infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance (gathering information about banking applications and internal procedures), which aligns with **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**.
   - Before moving laterally and downloading/executing new payloads (**T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**), the attackers would likely need to gain appropriate credentials to facilitate this movement.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** fits as a logical step after reconnaissance and before lateral movement, as it would provide the necessary credentials for such movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves credential dumping to facilitate the subsequent lateral movement.

Final Answer: D
