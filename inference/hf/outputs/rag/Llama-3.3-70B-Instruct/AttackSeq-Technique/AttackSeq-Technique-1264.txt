To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already used an AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) bypass method involving a DLL in PowerShell. This action is part of the Defense Evasion tactic, aiming to evade detection by security products. After this step, the attacker plans to establish command and control (C2) using njRAT, a remote access trojan. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between these two actions, still within the context of Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the Defense Evasion tactic. Specifically, they mention:
   - **T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to evade detection or bypass security controls.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded by a legitimate program, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code under the guise of a trusted process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying data to evade detection or create a false narrative. While it's a part of Defense Evasion, it doesn't directly relate to the context of evading security controls after an AMSI bypass and before establishing C2.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding or disguising artifacts of an intrusion to avoid detection. Given the context, hiding artifacts could be a logical step after bypassing AMSI to maintain stealth before establishing a C2 channel.
   - **C: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This involves renaming system utilities to blend in with legitimate system files, which could be a form of defense evasion but seems less directly related to the immediate need to evade detection after an AMSI bypass.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is a technique used for initial access, not typically for defense evasion after an attacker has already gained access and is looking to establish C2.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves an AMSI bypass, indicating the attacker is already focused on evading security controls.
   - The goal is to establish C2, which requires maintaining stealth to avoid detection.
   - Among the provided options, **T1564-Hide Artifacts** is the most relevant technique for maintaining stealth after an AMSI bypass and before establishing a C2 channel, as it directly contributes to evading detection.

Final Answer: B
