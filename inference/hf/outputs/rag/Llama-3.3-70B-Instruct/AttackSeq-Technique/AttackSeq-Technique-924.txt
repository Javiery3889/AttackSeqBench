To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during its runtime. The focus is on maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots, specifically under paths like %systemroot%\system32 or %programfiles%. This implies we're looking for a technique related to persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves manipulating the search order used by the system to find DLLs, allowing an adversary to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This can be used for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This involves injecting a DLL into a process to evade detection, which is more about defense evasion than persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be related to persistence but doesn't directly relate to the dynamic loading of DLLs for maintaining presence across reboots.
   - **B: T1110-Brute Force**: This is a technique used for gaining access through guessing passwords and is not relevant to the scenario described.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules (like DLLs) to execute code in another process's memory space. While related to DLLs, it's more about code execution than persistence across reboots.
   - **D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique is not directly related to the persistence of a Trojan through DLL loading in the context provided.

Given the context of maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots and the mention of loading a DLL, the most relevant technique from the provided options that aligns with the described scenario is not explicitly listed but can be inferred through the understanding of persistence and DLL manipulation. However, based on the closest match and the context of persistence and DLL manipulation, **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** (from the Related TTPs) seems to be what the question hints at, but since it's not an answer choice, we must select the closest related option from the provided choices.

Given the options and understanding that the question seems to point towards a persistence technique involving DLLs, but not perfectly matching any provided answer choice, the closest in terms of system modification for persistence (though not a perfect match) could be interpreted as **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**, considering the broader context of persistence and system modification. However, it's crucial to note this doesn't perfectly align with the expected answer based on the provided Related TTPs, which more directly point towards DLL hijacking for persistence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
- The question describes a scenario of a Trojan maintaining presence through DLL loading.
- The Related TTPs point towards persistence and defense evasion techniques involving DLLs.
- The closest technique related to the scenario described (persistence through DLL manipulation) is not directly listed among the answer choices but is hinted at through the Related TTPs.
- Given the options, **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process** seems the closest in terms of system modification for persistence, though it doesn't perfectly match the expected technique of DLL search order hijacking.

**Final Answer: A**
