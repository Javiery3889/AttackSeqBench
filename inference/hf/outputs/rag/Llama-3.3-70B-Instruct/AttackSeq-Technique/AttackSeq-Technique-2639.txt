To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather files from local systems and removable media before the data was exfiltrated using encryption and compression over Command and Control (C&C) channels. This implies we are looking for a technique related to data collection rather than exfiltration itself.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with gathering files from local systems and removable media.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique is about automatically exfiltrating data, which is what happens after the data collection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is also related to the exfiltration phase, not the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique directly involves collecting data from removable media and could logically extend to local systems, fitting the context of gathering files before exfiltration.
   - **B: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**: This technique is not directly related to collecting files from systems or removable media; it's more about manipulating system logs.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is an exfiltration technique, not a collection technique, and thus does not fit the action of gathering files before exfiltration.
   - **D: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting emails, which is a specific type of data collection but does not directly relate to gathering files from local systems and removable media in a general sense.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used to gather files before exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs provide a context that includes collection and exfiltration techniques.
   - T1025-Data from Removable Media is the only option directly related to collecting data from systems and removable media.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with collecting data, which aligns with option A.

Final Answer: A
