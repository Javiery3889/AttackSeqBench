To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious actor has renamed `rundll32.exe` to `ActiveFlash.exe` to execute malicious actions. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that would most likely be used to ensure the malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This suggests a method to gain higher privileges by ensuring malware execution at boot or logon.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This indicates the use of `rundll32.exe` for defense evasion, which aligns with the renaming of `rundll32.exe` to `ActiveFlash.exe` in the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This directly points to achieving persistence by ensuring the malware starts at boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring the malware's automatic startup, which directly relates to persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is mentioned twice under different tactics (Privilege Escalation and Persistence), emphasizing its relevance to both gaining persistence and potentially escalating privileges by executing at startup or logon.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** (options A and C) is about hijacking the execution flow of a process, which, while relevant to defense evasion, does not directly address the automatic startup of malware.
   - **T1546.002-Screensaver** (option B) is specific to using a screensaver to execute malware, which does not fit the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves renaming `rundll32.exe` to evade defenses and execute malicious actions.
   - The primary goal is to ensure the malware starts automatically, which is a persistence tactic.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is directly related to achieving persistence by executing at boot or logon, making it the most relevant technique for ensuring the malware's automatic startup.

Final Answer: D
