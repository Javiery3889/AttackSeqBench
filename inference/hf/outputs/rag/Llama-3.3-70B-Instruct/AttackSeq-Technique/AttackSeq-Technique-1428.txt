To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 during the strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where exploits (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) were used on Internet Explorer users as part of a strategic web compromise. This action is followed by an unspecified technique and then the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware. We need to identify the technique that most likely occurred after the exploitation but before the command and control phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access to a network. This is directly related to the initial exploitation described in the question.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in client applications to execute code. Given that the question mentions exploiting Internet Explorer users, this technique aligns closely with the described initial access method.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by exploiting vulnerabilities when they visit a malicious website or a website that has been compromised. This is also relevant to the strategic web compromise mentioned.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**: This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to proxy execution, which doesn't directly follow the exploitation of public-facing applications or drive-by compromise in the context provided.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This has already occurred as part of the initial access (exploiting Internet Explorer users), so it's not what we're looking for as the next step.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: After gaining initial access through exploitation, an attacker might attempt to hide their artifacts to avoid detection. This could plausibly occur after the initial exploitation and before establishing a more persistent command and control channel.
   - **D: T1003.003-NTDS**: This involves accessing or modifying the NTDS (NT Directory Service) database, which is more related to actions taken after establishing a foothold within a network, possibly not directly related to the immediate post-exploitation actions described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The exploitation of Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 aligns with **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** and **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**, indicating an initial access tactic.
   - After gaining access, the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish a presence that is not easily detectable, which involves hiding artifacts or establishing a covert channel for command and control.
   - Given the options and the context that the question provides, **hiding artifacts (T1564-Hide Artifacts)** seems like a plausible next step after the initial exploitation and before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control, as it would help in maintaining stealth and avoiding detection.

Final Answer: C
