To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes the Lazarus Group's actions, which include using system utilities like `net user` and `systeminfo.exe`, and the SMBMap utility to collect user and network information. The focus is on discovering shared resources within the network after these initial steps.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are categorized under the "Discovery" tactic, which involves gathering information about the target system or network. Specifically, the techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1082: System Information Discovery**: This involves collecting information about the system, which aligns with the use of `systeminfo.exe` and `net user`.
   - **T1135: Network Share Discovery**: This technique is about identifying shared resources on the network, which could be the next logical step after gathering system and user information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1021.005-VNC**: This involves using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote access, which doesn't directly relate to discovering shared resources.
   - **B: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**: This technique is about discovering device drivers, which doesn't directly follow the context of discovering shared network resources.
   - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**: Given the context of using SMBMap and the goal of discovering shared resources, this technique directly aligns with the next logical step after system and user information collection.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: While related to information gathering, this is more focused on victim identity rather than network resources.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lazarus Group starts by collecting system and user information using specific utilities.
   - The next logical step, given the use of SMBMap and the interest in network information, would be to discover shared resources within the network.
   - **T1135: Network Share Discovery** is the technique that directly corresponds to this action, as it involves identifying shared drives, directories, and other resources on the network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial information collection would involve discovering these shared resources.

Final Answer: C
