To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BRONZE PRESIDENT took steps to minimize detection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT has already taken steps to minimize detection. These steps include deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution. The goal here is to understand what action would logically follow such evasive maneuvers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are categorized under two tactics: Defense Evasion and Impact. 
   - **Defense Evasion** is about evading detection, which aligns with the actions described (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes).
   - **Impact** involves tactics that affect the system's operation or data, such as inhibiting system recovery (T1490).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**: This technique involves spoofing process arguments to disguise the actual command being executed, which could be a part of evasion but doesn't directly relate to the actions described.
   - **B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This involves bypassing security mechanisms to execute code, which could be relevant but doesn't directly follow from the actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique is about tricking users into divulging sensitive information, which doesn't directly follow the described actions focused on evasion and system impact.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the actions of deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The actions described (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes) are aimed at evasion and minimizing detection.
   - The related TTPs highlight Defense Evasion and Impact tactics, indicating the adversary is focused on evading detection and potentially causing system impact.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1070-Indicator Removal** directly relates to the actions taken to minimize detection, as it involves removing indicators that could be used to detect the adversary's presence.

**Final Answer: D**
