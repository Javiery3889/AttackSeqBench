To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Infamous Chisel persisted on the system by replacing the legitimate netd binary, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, Infamous Chisel, persists on a system by replacing a legitimate binary (/system/bin/netd) to execute as root. This action implies that the threat actor has already gained sufficient access to the system to modify system binaries, which is a significant level of privilege.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves naming a malicious file similarly to a legitimate file or placing it in a location where legitimate files reside to evade detection. This could be relevant to the scenario as replacing a legitimate binary with a malicious one matches this description.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**: This technique directly matches the action described in the question, where a legitimate binary is replaced with a malicious version to maintain persistence.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1037.004-RC Scripts**: This involves modifying RC scripts to execute a command or program automatically when a user logs in or the system boots. While related to persistence, it doesn't directly relate to replacing system binaries.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**: This technique involves adding a new group to a system or domain, which doesn't directly relate to the action of replacing a binary for persistence.
   - **B: T1554-Compromise Client Software Binary**: This is the exact technique described in the question, where a legitimate binary is compromised (replaced) to achieve persistence. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **before** this action.
   - **C: T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: This technique involves exploiting a Kerberos feature to obtain hashed credentials, which doesn't directly relate to replacing system binaries for persistence.
   - **D: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the installed software on a system, which could be a precursor to identifying a binary to replace for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that replacing a system binary requires knowledge of the system's software and configuration, **T1518-Software Discovery** is a plausible precursor. It involves discovering software on the system, which could include identifying the netd binary as a target for replacement.
   - While **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** is related to evasion techniques that could be used in conjunction with binary replacement, it's more about the method of evasion rather than a necessary precursor to replacing a binary.
   - **T1554-Compromise Client Software Binary** is what was done, not what happened before.
   - **T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups** and **T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting** don't directly relate to the necessary steps leading up to replacing a system binary for persistence.

**Final Answer: D**
