To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BlackEnergy's malicious Word document was executed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious Word document with a macro is executed, leading to the creation and running of "vba_macro.exe". This indicates an initial execution phase of the attack where the adversary is leveraging a macro in a Word document to execute malicious code.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the "Execution" tactic, which involves techniques used to execute malicious code on a victim's system. Specifically, the techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This involves executing malicious files, which aligns with the execution of "vba_macro.exe" after the macro in the Word document is run.
   - **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VB) for execution, which is relevant because the scenario mentions a macro (written in Visual Basic for Applications, VBA) being executed from a Word document.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves deleting or destroying data, which does not directly follow the execution of a malicious file or macro in terms of a logical sequence of attack steps.
   - **B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This involves interacting with network devices using command-line interfaces, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious macro from a Word document.
   - **C: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**: This technique is about accessing cloud service metadata, which is unrelated to the execution of a local macro or file.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code through user interaction, such as clicking on a link or opening a malicious document. Given that the scenario starts with the execution of a macro from a Word document (which requires user interaction to open the document), this seems like a plausible preceding step but considering the context of "after" the execution, we need to think about what happens as a result of that initial execution.

Given the context, the execution of "vba_macro.exe" as a result of the macro in the Word document being run suggests that the system is now executing malicious code. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred "after" this execution. Since **T1204-User Execution** is about the initial execution of malicious code by a user (which has already happened in this scenario), we need to consider what happens next in the attack sequence.

However, upon closer examination, **T1204-User Execution** is the technique that has been described in the setup of the question (the execution of the macro), and the question seems to be asking for what happens next. Given the choices and understanding that the initial execution has occurred, none of the provided choices perfectly fit the "next step" in a typical attack sequence without more context on what "vba_macro.exe" does. 

But, considering the spirit of the question and the provided choices, **D: T1204-User Execution** is the closest in context to the described action (execution of a macro), even though it's more about the initial step of executing the malicious code rather than a subsequent step. The other options provided do not directly follow the execution of a malicious macro in a logical sequence of attack steps based on the information given.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
1. The question describes the execution of a malicious macro from a Word document.
2. The related TTPs indicate an "Execution" tactic, focusing on executing malicious code.
3. The answer choices are evaluated for relevance to the sequence of events following the execution of "vba_macro.exe".
4. Given the context and the provided choices, the most relevant technique to the scenario described, although it represents the initial execution step rather than a subsequent action, is **T1204-User Execution**.

Final Answer: D
