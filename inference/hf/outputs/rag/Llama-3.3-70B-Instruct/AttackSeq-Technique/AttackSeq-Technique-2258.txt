To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker uses GoLang-based file recon plugins for file enumeration targeting credentials and deploys malicious payloads via Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. The goal is to retrieve Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. This implies the attacker is looking to gather sensitive information (credentials) from the compromised systems.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the "Discovery" tactic, which includes techniques for gathering information about the target system or network. Specifically:
   - **T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the browser, which could include history, bookmarks, or other relevant data that might be useful for further exploitation or for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is about enumerating files and directories on the target system, which aligns with the initial step mentioned in the question where GoLang-based file recon plugins are used for file enumeration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1601-Modify System Image**: This technique involves modifying the system image, which doesn't directly relate to the retrieval of specific databases or files like Kavach authentication databases.
   - **B: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. While it's a method of data exfiltration, the question doesn't specifically mention cloud storage as the target for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to trick users into revealing sensitive information. It doesn't directly relate to the retrieval of specific files or databases from infected devices.
   - **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. Given the context of deploying malicious payloads via C2 infrastructure and the goal of retrieving Kavach authentication databases, automated exfiltration is the most relevant technique. It aligns with the scenario where an attacker, having gained access and enumerated files, would use automated means to exfiltrate the targeted data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an attack sequence focused on enumerating files for credential targeting and deploying malicious payloads.
   - The related TTPs highlight discovery tactics, which are preliminary steps in the attack sequence.
   - The goal is to retrieve specific databases (Kavach authentication databases), indicating a need for data exfiltration.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the technique that most directly aligns with the exfiltration of specific data (in this case, Kavach authentication databases) from infected devices, especially considering the use of C2 infrastructure for deploying malicious payloads.

Final Answer: D
