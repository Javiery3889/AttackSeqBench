To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where spear-phishing emails are used for initial access, and then it asks about the technique that best describes the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to support the attackers' campaigns. This implies we are looking for a technique related to obtaining or using tools that facilitate further malicious activity after initial access has been gained.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the initial access tactic, specifically phishing (T1566) and spear-phishing link (T1566.002). These are methods used by attackers to gain initial access to a system or network. However, the question is asking about what happens after this initial access, specifically about deploying tools like backdoors and RATs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves obtaining code signing certificates to make malicious software appear legitimate. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to deploying backdoors or RATs.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or expertise to support the attack. Deploying custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs fits well within this description, as it involves obtaining and utilizing capabilities to further the attack.
   - **C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique is about modifying or defacing internal web pages. It doesn't directly relate to deploying backdoors or RATs.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique used in the scenario but doesn't describe the deployment of tools like backdoors or RATs after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that describes the deployment of tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs after initial access via spear-phishing.
   - The related TTPs provide context for the initial access method but don't directly answer the question about tool deployment.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** is the most relevant to the deployment of tools to support an attack campaign.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely describes the activity of ensuring the deployment of such tools is **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**.

Final Answer: B
