To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the RIG Exploit kit distributed CEIDPageLock and before the dropper started the kernel-mode driver for persistence, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the RIG Exploit kit has already been used to distribute malware (CEIDPageLock) by exploiting a vulnerability and altering the victim's browser homepage. This action is associated with the initial access phase of an attack. The question asks for the technique that likely occurred after this initial access but before the establishment of persistence through a kernel-mode driver.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification**: This technique involves modifying code signing policies to make malicious code appear legitimate, which can happen at various stages of an attack to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web-based attack, which aligns with the initial exploitation described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about maintaining access to a system through autostart mechanisms, which is relevant to the persistence phase mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the RIG Exploit kit has already achieved initial access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise), we're looking for a technique that would logically follow this phase but precede the establishment of persistence.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise (A and B)**: Since this technique is already mentioned as the method of initial access, it's less likely to be the answer we're looking for, as we need a technique that occurs after this point.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. While it could fit into various stages of an attack, it's not directly implied by the given context as the immediate next step after initial access and before persistence.
   - **T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique doesn't directly fit the sequence described, as it involves using remote access software, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the context provided.
   - Considering the need for a technique that fits between initial access and persistence, and given the provided options, **none directly describe the typical next steps** like establishing a foothold or evading defenses before persistence. However, **T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification** (not listed as an answer choice but mentioned in the related TTPs) could be a plausible action taken to evade defenses before establishing persistence, but it's not an option.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question seems to have a mistake with duplicate answer choices (A and B), which might indicate an error in the question formulation.
   - Given the context and the need to select from the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems the least unlikely as it could potentially be used in the communication between the compromised system and the command and control server after the initial compromise and before the persistence mechanism is fully established. However, this choice feels like a stretch given the direct context provided.
   - **Final Answer: C**
