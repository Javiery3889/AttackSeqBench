To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the adversary used discovery commands such as PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The adversary has already used discovery commands (like PsLogList) to extract the Windows Security Event Log contents. This action is related to the Discovery tactic, aiming to gather information about the system or network. The next step we're trying to identify happens before data exfiltration using a custom tool to cloud storage.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This is directly related to the initial action described, where the adversary enumerates logs, which aligns with using PsLogList for extracting log contents.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This involves automatically collecting data from a system, which could be a step after discovering what data is available and before exfiltrating it.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique involves clearing logs to evade detection, which might not directly relate to the sequence of discovering and then exfiltrating data but is relevant for understanding post-exploitation activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing input like credentials from web portals, which doesn't directly follow the sequence of log enumeration and data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which aligns well with the sequence of discovering what data is available (through log enumeration) and then collecting it before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique is related to exploiting Microsoft Management Console (MMC) vulnerabilities, which doesn't directly fit the described sequence of actions.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is close to the final step described (exfiltrating data) but doesn't exactly match the use of a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary starts by enumerating logs (Discovery), which is directly related to the initial action.
   - The next logical step, based on the provided context, would be collecting the data of interest from the local system, which aligns with **T1005-Data from Local System**.
   - This collection would occur before the data is exfiltrated using a custom tool to cloud storage services.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves data collection from the local system after log enumeration and before exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
