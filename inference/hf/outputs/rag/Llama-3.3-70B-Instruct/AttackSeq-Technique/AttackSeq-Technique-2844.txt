To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware sends system information to a specific IP address using the command line and then communicates with a C2 (Command and Control) server using HTTPS with a POST method. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic of Command and Control and a technique of T1071.001-Web Protocols. This suggests that the communication between the malware and the C2 server involves web protocols, which are commonly used for command and control communications due to their ubiquity and ability to blend in with normal traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to obfuscate C2 traffic. While it's a method used for command and control, the question specifically mentions the use of HTTPS with a POST method, which doesn't directly imply the use of a dead drop resolver.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for command and control. Given that the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS (a form of HTTP) with a POST method, this technique aligns closely with the scenario described.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about using software deployment tools for initial access or execution. It doesn't directly relate to the communication method between the malware and the C2 server.
   - **D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**: This technique is related to impacting cloud computing resources and doesn't fit the context of the communication between malware and a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of HTTPS with a POST method for communication between the malware and the C2 server.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that directly involves using application layer protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) for command and control communications.
   - The related TTPs support the use of web protocols for C2 communications, further aligning with T1071.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control.

Final Answer: B
