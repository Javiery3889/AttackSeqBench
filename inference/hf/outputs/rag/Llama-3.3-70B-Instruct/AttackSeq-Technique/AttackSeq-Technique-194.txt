To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after FamousSparrow utilized cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor in the Execution phase, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the actions taken by FamousSparrow during the Execution phase of an attack. Specifically, it mentions the use of cmd.exe for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor. This indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now executing commands to establish persistence or further their goals.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Execution** - This is the phase where the attacker executes their malicious code or commands on the compromised system.
   - **Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell** - This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) to execute commands. This aligns with the action described in the question, where cmd.exe is used to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves sending phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. Given that the SparrowDoor backdoor has already been installed, this technique would have occurred before the Execution phase described.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** - This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. Like spearphishing, this would typically occur before the Execution phase mentioned.
   - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation** - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to escalate privileges or maintain access. Given that the attacker has already executed commands to install a backdoor, manipulating access tokens could be a subsequent step to ensure persistence or elevate privileges.
   - **D: T1597-Search Closed Sources** - This technique involves searching closed sources (like internal networks or systems) for sensitive information. While this could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly follow from the action of installing a backdoor in terms of establishing or maintaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes actions taken during the Execution phase, specifically using cmd.exe to install a backdoor.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of the Windows Command Shell, which is directly mentioned in the question.
   - Considering the sequence of actions in an attack, after installing a backdoor, an attacker might seek to manipulate access tokens to maintain access or escalate privileges.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after installing the SparrowDoor backdoor would be to manipulate access tokens to ensure continued access or to gain higher privileges.

Final Answer: C
