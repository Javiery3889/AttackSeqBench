To determine the most plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by Agrius after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after gaining persistence. This implies we are looking for techniques related to maintaining access, executing commands, and evading detection.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This indicates the use of Windows services to maintain persistence on a compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**: This suggests modifying or compromising software binaries on the host to achieve persistence.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This shows the use of Windows services for escalating privileges, which could be part of maintaining access and executing commands with higher privileges.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands, which could be a method for command execution but doesn't directly relate to minimizing detection after achieving persistence.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique is about removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection, which aligns with minimizing detection but doesn't directly address command execution.
   - **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This is a code injection technique that could be used for command execution and potentially for evading detection by hiding malicious code within legitimate processes.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which can help in evading detection and could be used in conjunction with other techniques for persistence and privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks about ensuring command execution and minimizing detection after achieving persistence.
   - The related TTPs suggest a focus on persistence and potentially privilege escalation using Windows services.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection (C)** stands out because it directly relates to executing commands (potentially with elevated privileges if combined with privilege escalation techniques) and can be used to minimize detection by injecting code into legitimate processes, making it harder to detect malicious activity.
   - While **T1070-Indicator Removal (B)** is about minimizing detection, it doesn't directly address command execution. **T1021-Remote Services (A)** and **T1202-Indirect Command Execution (D)** are relevant but don't as directly combine the aspects of command execution and evasion as **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection (C)** does, especially in the context of the provided related TTPs.

**Final Answer: C**
