To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information using various tools (keyloggers, screenshotters, clipboard stealers) and asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to transfer this collected information to remote servers. This implies we are looking for a technique related to the exfiltration of data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This suggests the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a network.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This is related to the collection of data through keylogging, which is mentioned in the question as a method used by CosmicDuke.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This indicates keylogging is also used for credential access, further emphasizing its role in data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using removable media, which does not directly relate to transferring data to remote servers over a network.
   - **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique is about gathering information on the victim's network, not exfiltrating collected data.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: Given that CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information and the question asks about transferring this information to remote servers, automated exfiltration is a plausible method for doing so, especially since it's directly related to the exfiltration tactic.
   - **D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which could be a method for transferring data to remote servers but is more specific to web services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the exfiltration of collected data to remote servers.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of automated exfiltration as part of the exfiltration tactic.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** directly aligns with the exfiltration tactic and is a general method that could encompass various means of automated data transfer, including but not limited to web services.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for transferring the collected information to remote servers, given the context and related TTPs, is **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: C
