To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28, after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, needs to centralize the information as part of their Discovery tactic. This implies they are looking to gather more information about the systems they've identified.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks

   These TTPs indicate that the attackers are in the phase of gathering information about potential targets and have already started scanning IP blocks as part of reconnaissance. The Discovery tactic involves figuring out what systems, data, and users are available within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the containers and resources available within a network or system. While it's a discovery technique, it's more specific to containerized environments and might not directly follow the broad scanning of IP ranges.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique is about exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols, which doesn't fit the context of discovering or scanning systems.
   - **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This involves accessing process memory, which is more related to post-exploitation activities rather than the initial discovery phase.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique directly aligns with the Discovery tactic and involves identifying remote systems, which would logically follow the scanning of IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already scanned IP blocks (T1595.001) as part of their reconnaissance.
   - The next logical step in their Discovery tactic, after identifying potential targets through scanning, would be to gather more specific information about those systems.
   - T1018-Remote System Discovery fits perfectly as it involves discovering remote systems, which would be a natural next step after scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, as part of the Discovery tactic, would involve discovering more about those remote systems.

Final Answer: D
