To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of the ThreatNeedle backdoor for initial reconnaissance and its use in facilitating lateral movement. This indicates that the attackers have already gained access to the network and are now looking to understand the environment better to proceed with their objectives. The question specifically asks about the discovery phase before activities such as system network configuration discovery and file discovery.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This is related to how the attackers move within the network, which is relevant after the initial access.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network configuration, which is part of the discovery phase but seems to be one of the activities that happened after the technique we are trying to identify.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: Similar to T1016, this is about discovering files and directories, which is also part of the discovery phase and seems to follow the technique we are looking for.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services, which could be a precursor to understanding the network layout and identifying potential targets for lateral movement or further exploitation. It fits well as an activity that would occur during the discovery phase, potentially before more specific discoveries like system network configuration or file discovery.
   - **B: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: This is more specific to cloud services and might not directly relate to the general network and system discovery activities mentioned.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, which could include details necessary for planning further actions but might be more general and not as directly related to the specific activities of system network configuration and file discovery as network service discovery.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique is about tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, which doesn't fit the context of post-compromise discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the discovery phase after initial access and lateral movement have been achieved.
   - The related TTPs indicate activities that are part of the discovery tactic but seem to follow the specific technique we are trying to identify.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1046-Network Service Discovery** is the most relevant to the discovery phase and precedes more specific discovery activities like system network configuration and file discovery.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after deploying the backdoor and facilitating lateral movement, the attackers would likely engage in network service discovery to understand the network layout and services available.

Final Answer: A
