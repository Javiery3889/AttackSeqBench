To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the use of social media mobile apps for reconnaissance to steal personal contact information. This is followed by an action where HTTPS landing pages are used to harvest credentials by mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset emails. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this credential harvesting step.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all categorized under the "Reconnaissance" tactic, which involves gathering information about the target. The techniques include:
   - **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This involves using a service to send spearphishing emails. Spearphishing is a targeted attack where attackers send emails that appear to be from a trusted source to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.
   - **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase to understand what credentials are available or can be targeted.
   - **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: Similar to T1598.001, but specifically involves sending links in emails that, when clicked, can lead to malicious activities such as credential harvesting.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.002-AppleScript**: This technique involves using AppleScript for execution. It doesn't directly relate to the reconnaissance or credential harvesting described.
   - **B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: This involves creating a ticket that can be used to authenticate to a service, which is more related to lateral movement or privilege escalation rather than the initial reconnaissance or credential harvesting.
   - **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: While this technique is about gathering network information, it doesn't directly precede the action of harvesting credentials via mimicry of password recovery emails.
   - **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves creating forged web credentials, which could be a step after gathering information (such as through spearphishing) and before attempting to use those credentials.

Given the context of using social media to gather personal contact information and then leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials, the most likely preceding technique would involve gathering or manipulating information that would facilitate the credential harvesting process. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attacker starts by gathering personal contact information through social media mobile apps.
2. This information could be used to craft targeted spearphishing emails or messages that mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails.
3. The use of HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials suggests a focus on credential theft.
4. Among the provided options, **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service** or **T1598.003-Spearphishing Link** would be closely related to the initial steps of sending targeted emails or links to victims. However, these are not among the answer choices directly.
5. Considering the closest match in terms of the sequence of actions (reconnaissance leading to credential harvesting), **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials** seems to be the most relevant technique that would occur before leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials, as it involves creating or manipulating credentials which could be used in phishing attacks or other forms of credential theft.

**Final Answer**: D
