To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using scanning tools and stolen credentials for discovery, attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to target servers. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this lateral movement.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on Lateral Movement, specifically mentioning the exploitation of remote services (T1210) and the use of Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001). These are techniques used by attackers to move laterally within a network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting emails from remote services, which doesn't directly relate to the use of RDP for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts on a remote system, which could be part of lateral movement but doesn't directly precede the deployment of RDP.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This is a broader technique that includes using remote services for lateral movement. Given that T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a sub-technique of T1021, and the question mentions deploying RDP, this option seems closely related to the scenario described.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This sub-technique of T1021 involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which doesn't directly relate to deploying RDP to target servers within a network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of RDP for lateral movement, which is a sub-technique of T1021-Remote Services.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of remote services in lateral movement, aligning with the use of RDP.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves the exploitation or utilization of remote services (in a broad sense) before specifically using RDP for lateral movement.

Final Answer: C
