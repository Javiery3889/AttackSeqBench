To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes how ProjectM developed its capabilities after conducting reconnaissance. This implies we are looking for a technique related to enhancing or building upon existing capabilities, likely after initial access or reconnaissance has been achieved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include techniques for initial access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and reconnaissance (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link). These are methods used to gain initial access to a system or network and to gather information, respectively.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1543.005-Container Service**: This technique involves using a container service to evade detection or to execute code. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to developing capabilities after reconnaissance.
   - **B: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This involves compromising network devices, which could be a step in expanding access within a network but doesn't directly imply developing capabilities.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique directly involves developing capabilities, such as obtaining or creating tools, which aligns with the question's context of developing capabilities after reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique is about collecting information on victims, which is more aligned with reconnaissance rather than developing capabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks about developing capabilities after reconnaissance, indicating a need for a technique that involves enhancing or building capabilities.
   - The related TTPs show methods of initial access and reconnaissance, setting the stage for what happens after these initial steps.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1587-Develop Capabilities** is the most relevant to the context of developing capabilities after initial reconnaissance and access have been achieved.
   
Final Answer: C
