To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT33 conducted reconnaissance on relevant networks using private VPN exit nodes but before they issued commands to bots through their private VPN network, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by APT33, starting with reconnaissance using private VPN exit nodes, followed by an unknown technique, and ending with issuing commands to bots through their private VPN network. The reconnaissance phase suggests an initial access or exploration phase where the attackers are gathering information about the target networks.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This suggests that the attackers are using external remote services as a means to gain initial access to the target network. This could involve using services like VPNs, which aligns with the use of private VPN exit nodes mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This indicates that the attackers are also using external remote services to maintain persistence within the network. Persistence tactics are employed after initial access has been achieved, to ensure continued access to the target network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to evade detection. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of reconnaissance, accessing the network, and then commanding bots.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which could be a step after initial reconnaissance, especially if the attackers are using VPNs to explore and map the target network before issuing commands.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is about evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of accessing a network and commanding bots.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used for initial access, often involving tricking users into divulging sensitive information. It doesn't fit the timeline described, as it would typically occur before the reconnaissance phase mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already conducted reconnaissance, indicating they have some level of access or visibility into the network.
   - They are using external remote services for both initial access and persistence, which involves leveraging services like VPNs to maintain a foothold in the network.
   - Before issuing commands to bots, the attackers would likely need to ensure they can discover and potentially map the remote systems within the network to understand where their bots are located and what systems they can control.
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** fits this sequence as it involves identifying systems on the network, which would be necessary for commanding bots effectively.

Final Answer: B
