To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT10 is staging data for exfiltration and compressing it in locations like the Recycle Bin. It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement across the network. This implies we are looking for a technique that is related to data collection or preparation for exfiltration, happening after the attackers have moved laterally within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Collection) and a technique (T1074.001-Local Data Staging). This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the collection and staging of data, which is a precursor to exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**: This technique involves using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement, which doesn't directly relate to the staging or archiving of data for exfiltration.
   - **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**: This technique is related to network device exploitation and doesn't directly fit the context of staging data for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique directly involves archiving data, which aligns with the scenario described where data is staged and compressed for exfiltration. Given that T1074.001 (Local Data Staging) is a related TTP, archiving collected data is a logical next step in preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique is related to the initial access vector and does not fit the scenario of data staging and exfiltration after lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred after lateral movement and before data exfiltration.
   - Lateral movement is typically followed by data collection and staging.
   - The related TTP (T1074.001-Local Data Staging) supports the idea that data staging is a key step.
   - Archiving collected data (T1560) is a logical step after data staging and before exfiltration, especially since the question mentions staging data in multi-part archives and compressing them.
   
Final Answer: C
