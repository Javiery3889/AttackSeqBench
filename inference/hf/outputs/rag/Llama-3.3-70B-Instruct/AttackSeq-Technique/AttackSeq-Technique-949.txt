To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the communication establishment between Sednit's downloaders/backdoors and the Command & Control (C&C) server. This communication is characterized by the use of encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports. The key elements here are encryption, hex-encoding, and the use of common ports for communication.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding schemes (like base64) to hide the true nature of the data being sent. While this is about encoding, it's more about standard encoding methods rather than the specifics of encryption or hex-encoding mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using unusual ports for C&C communication to evade detection. However, the question specifies the use of "commonly used ports," which contrasts with this technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses to establish C&C communications. Given that the question mentions communication with a C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports, dynamic resolution could be a precursor to establishing such communication, as it would allow the malware to dynamically find the C&C server.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique is about capturing screenshots of the victim's desktop. It doesn't directly relate to establishing C&C communications.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption within the communication channel. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the question asks for a technique that occurred "before" the establishment of such encrypted communications.
   - **D: T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique is unrelated to the establishment of C&C communications and involves exploiting print processors for privilege escalation or code execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for a technique that likely occurred before the establishment of encrypted and hex-encoded communications with the C&C server.
   - Given the context, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** seems the most plausible as it could be a step that precedes the actual communication, allowing the malware to find and connect to the C&C server.
   - The other options either don't fit the timeline (C), are unrelated to the communication setup (B and D), or contrast with the specifics of the communication method described (related TTPs).

Final Answer: A
