To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has exploited CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure the SLUB backdoor remained active upon system startup before conducting discovery using GitHub gists. The key elements here are the exploitation for privilege escalation and the need for persistence (ensuring the backdoor remains active).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation. This is relevant as it aligns with the initial action of exploiting CVE-2015-1701.
   - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. This technique is about achieving persistence by adding entries to the registry run keys or startup folder, ensuring that a program runs at startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique is related to bypassing multi-factor authentication, which does not directly relate to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - **B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This involves loading a DLL into processes using the AppInit DLL mechanism, which can be a method for persistence but is not the most direct method related to startup execution in the context provided.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique is related to capturing screenshots, which does not align with ensuring a backdoor's persistence.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves achieving persistence by executing at boot or logon time. Given the context of ensuring the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup, this is the most relevant technique. The specific sub-technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder mentioned in the related TTPs further supports this choice, as it is a method under the broader category of achieving autostart execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that ensures the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup after exploiting a vulnerability for privilege escalation.
   - The exploitation for privilege escalation (T1068) has already occurred, and the focus is on persistence.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of registry run keys or startup folders for persistence, which falls under the broader technique of achieving autostart execution.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves ensuring the backdoor starts automatically upon system startup, which aligns with **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: D
