To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the question, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of PsLogList to identify privileged user activity during the discovery phase. PsLogList is a tool that can be used to enumerate logon sessions, which aligns with the discovery tactic, specifically techniques related to understanding the system's users and their activities. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this discovery phase but before the exfiltration of data from network shared drives.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This is directly related to the exfiltration of data mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the owners or users of a system, which can be related to the use of PsLogList for identifying privileged user activity.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This involves discovering files and directories on the system, which could be a step in understanding what data is available for exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1491.002-External Defacement**: This technique involves modifying the external-facing website of an organization, which does not directly relate to the sequence of discovering user activity and then exfiltrating data from network shared drives.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1123-Audio Capture**: This involves capturing audio from the target, which is unrelated to the discovery of user activity and data exfiltration from shared drives.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This directly relates to the action of exfiltrating data from network shared drives but does not describe an action that would occur before this exfiltration in the context of using PsLogList.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems or data, which could be a step after discovering user activity (using PsLogList) to gain access to network shared drives before exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of PsLogList indicates the adversary is in the discovery phase, trying to understand user activity.
   - After identifying potential targets or accounts of interest, the next logical step would be to use valid accounts (T1078) to access the network shared drives.
   - This access would then facilitate the exfiltration of data from these drives (T1039), which is the final step mentioned in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after using PsLogList and before exfiltrating data involves using valid accounts to access the shared drives.

Final Answer: D
