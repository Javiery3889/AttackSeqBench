To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the initial access technique used by APT-TOCS before executing Shellcode scripts in memory for network communication via Beacon mode. This implies we are looking for a technique that allows attackers to gain initial access to the targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This suggests exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation**, **Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This involves injecting code into processes to escalate privileges, which is a step that would typically occur after initial access has been gained.
   - **Tactic: Execution**, **Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves using PowerShell to execute commands, which can be part of the execution tactic but doesn't directly imply initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This involves using valid domain accounts to gain access, which could be a method of initial access but doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of public-facing applications or the execution of shellcode in memory as described.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This directly matches one of the related TTPs and is a common method for gaining initial access to a network by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications exposed to the internet.
   - **C: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique is more related to the communication between processes and doesn't directly imply a method for initial access.
   - **D: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: While this could potentially be used for privilege escalation or persistence, it's less directly related to the initial access method described in the scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique that allowed attackers to establish initial access before executing shellcode.
   - The related TTPs highlight **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** as part of the initial access tactic.
   - This technique aligns with common attack vectors where exploiting public-facing applications is a typical first step for gaining access to a network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access.

Final Answer: B
