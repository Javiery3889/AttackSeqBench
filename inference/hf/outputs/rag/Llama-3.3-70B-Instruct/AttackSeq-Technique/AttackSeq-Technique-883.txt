To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access and before the lateral movement, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities. This is related to the technique T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment, which is listed under the Initial Access tactic. This method allowed the attackers to gain initial access to the system.

2. **Objective**: The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the initial access (which was achieved through spear phishing) and before the lateral movement, where the attackers deployed modules for scanning the local network and accessing hosts using admin credentials.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The techniques mentioned under the Lateral Movement tactic include T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services and T1534 - Internal Spearphishing. However, the question hints at a step that precedes the actual lateral movement techniques, which involve using admin credentials to access hosts.

4. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1548.005 - Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**: This technique involves using temporary access to cloud resources, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1090 - Proxy**: This technique could be used for command and control (C2) communications but doesn't directly fit the sequence of gaining access and then moving laterally within a network.
   - **C: T1078 - Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which aligns with the description of using admin credentials for lateral movement. However, the question asks for a technique that occurs before the lateral movement, which involves using these credentials.
   - **D: T1574.014 - AppDomainManager**: This is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence involves the attackers gaining initial access, then likely using valid accounts (which they might have obtained or compromised during the initial access phase) to facilitate their movement within the network. However, the question specifically asks for a technique that occurs before the lateral movement, which involves scanning the network and accessing hosts with admin credentials.

Considering the provided options and the context of the attack sequence, **T1078 - Valid Accounts** seems to be the closest match because it involves using valid credentials, which could be a step that enables the lateral movement described. The attackers likely needed to obtain or use valid accounts (possibly by exploiting the initial access to gain credentials) before they could effectively move laterally within the network using admin credentials.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Spear phishing with exploits.
2. Understand the objective: Find the technique that occurs after initial access and before lateral movement.
3. Analyze related TTPs: Focus on techniques related to lateral movement and initial access.
4. Evaluate answer choices: Determine which technique is most likely to occur before lateral movement, considering the need for valid credentials.

**Final Answer**: C
