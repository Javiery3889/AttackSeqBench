To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access was gained. The initial access method mentioned is spear phishing using a malicious Microsoft Word document. This indicates we are looking for a precursor activity to the actual phishing attempt.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Initial Access and specifically mention techniques related to phishing (T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). These are the methods used for gaining initial access, not the steps that precede them.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities that can be used for operations. This could include developing or acquiring malware, which could be used in phishing campaigns. It's a plausible precursor to a phishing campaign as it involves preparation.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to gain access or conduct operations. While it could be related to the broader campaign, it doesn't directly precede the act of phishing as a necessary step.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system. While important for targeted attacks, the question focuses on the steps leading up to the phishing attempt, not the reconnaissance that might have occurred beforehand.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for initial access and not a precursor to it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that the question asks for the technique that occurred before the initial access via phishing, we need to consider what would logically precede such an action.
   - Developing capabilities (T1587) is a broader activity that could include preparing the tools (like the malicious Microsoft Word document) used in the phishing campaign. It's a necessary step before executing the phishing campaign, as the attackers would need to have the capability (malware, etc.) ready to use.
   - The other options either are the act of initial access itself (T1566) or are not directly related to the preparation for a phishing campaign (T1133, T1082).

**Final Answer: A**
