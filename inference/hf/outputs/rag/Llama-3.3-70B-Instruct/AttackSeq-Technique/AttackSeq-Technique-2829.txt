To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where, after collecting specified files and updating its configuration, the attacker (BlackSoul) exfiltrates data over a Command and Control (C2) channel using automated methods. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the Exfiltration tactic, specifically:
   - **T1020: Automated Exfiltration** - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system without the need for manual operator interaction.
   - **T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel used for command and control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1037.002-Login Hook**: This technique involves intercepting and modifying authentication credentials. It doesn't directly relate to the preparation for exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This technique involves intercepting and modifying network traffic. While it could be related to communication, it's not directly about preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding or disguising files or data. Obfuscation could be a step to prepare data for exfiltration, making it less detectable.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable. Encoding is a common step before exfiltration, especially when data is sent over a C2 channel, as it can help evade detection by security systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that after collecting files and updating the configuration, the next step involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel using automated methods.
   - For data to be exfiltrated effectively, especially in an automated manner over a C2 channel, it often needs to be prepared in a way that evades detection.
   - Between obfuscation (C) and encoding (D), both could potentially be used to prepare data for exfiltration. However, encoding (D) is more directly related to modifying the data itself to make it less detectable during transmission, which aligns well with the automated exfiltration over a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: D**
