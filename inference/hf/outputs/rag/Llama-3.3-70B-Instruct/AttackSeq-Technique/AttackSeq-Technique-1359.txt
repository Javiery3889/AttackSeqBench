To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack where a first-stage downloader saves a file named "Rdws.exe" in the "%Temp%" directory, which later retrieves a second-stage PlugX file. This indicates a multi-stage attack where the initial compromise is followed by the download of additional malware. The attack vector involves a compromised website spoofing a legitimate organization, suggesting that the initial access was gained through deceptive means, possibly by tricking a user into visiting the spoofed website.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to avoid detection, which aligns with the multi-stage nature of the attack described.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's device by exploiting vulnerabilities when they visit a compromised website, which fits the scenario of a spoofed website being used to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malware or activity to evade detection, which could relate to the use of a legitimate-looking website to trick users.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This involves targeted phishing attacks, which might not directly relate to the scenario of visiting a compromised website.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique is about using encrypted communication channels, which doesn't directly relate to the initial access method described.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This involves executing code without traditional server infrastructure, which doesn't directly fit the scenario of a compromised website leading to a multi-stage download.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique directly aligns with the scenario of a user being compromised by visiting a spoofed website, leading to the download of malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attack involves a multi-stage process with an initial compromise through a spoofed website.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of multi-stage channels and drive-by compromise as relevant techniques.
   - The most direct method of gaining access through a compromised website is by exploiting vulnerabilities when a user visits the site, which aligns with drive-by compromise.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access is drive-by compromise.

Final Answer: D
