To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) is collected from an iOS device and then sent out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for this data exfiltration method.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Command and Control, focusing on techniques related to data encoding. Specifically, T1132 (Data Encoding) and its sub-technique T1132.001 (Standard Encoding) are mentioned. Data encoding is a method used by attackers to hide or disguise the data they are exfiltrating, making it less detectable by security systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery** is related to discovering the system's location, which doesn't directly relate to encoding or sending data.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** involves encoding data to avoid detection, which aligns with the use of Base64 encoded tokens for sending sensitive information.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting** is a technique used to hide the true destination of command and control traffic but doesn't directly involve encoding data for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** is about compromising software dependencies, which is unrelated to the encoding and exfiltration of data as described.

Given the focus on encoding data (specifically using Base64 encoding) to send it out, the most relevant technique is data encoding, which is directly related to hiding or disguising data during exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of Base64 encoded tokens for sending sensitive information collected from an iOS device.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of data encoding in the context of command and control.
   - Among the answer choices, only one directly pertains to the method of encoding data for exfiltration purposes.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred for sending the information out via Base64 encoded tokens is related to data encoding.

Final Answer: B
