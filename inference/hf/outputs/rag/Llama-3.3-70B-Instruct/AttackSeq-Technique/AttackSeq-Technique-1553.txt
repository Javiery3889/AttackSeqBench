To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before APT42 conducted internal reconnaissance, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of custom malware for keystroke logging and stealing logins for privilege escalation. This implies that the attackers are interested in gaining higher privileges within the system. After obtaining these credentials, they conduct internal reconnaissance, which includes browsing compromised user contacts and accessing collaborative spaces like SharePoint.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include tactics and techniques related to "Privilege Escalation" and "Credential Access". Specifically, techniques like T1078.004 (Cloud Accounts) under Privilege Escalation and T1552.008 (Chat Messages) under Credential Access are mentioned. However, the key here is to understand that the attackers are looking to escalate privileges and access sensitive areas of the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts to bypass MFA challenges. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the initial step of using custom malware for keystroke logging and stealing logins.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. Given that the attackers used custom malware for keystroke logging and stealing logins, dumping OS credentials could be a plausible step to obtain credentials for privilege escalation before conducting internal reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1221-Template Injection**: This technique is more related to exploiting vulnerabilities in template engines of web applications, which doesn't directly align with the scenario of keystroke logging and internal reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**: This is a specific subtype of OS Credential Dumping focused on Unix-based systems. While relevant, the question does not specify the operating system, making the broader category of T1003 more applicable.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers used custom malware for keystroke logging and stealing logins, indicating an interest in obtaining credentials.
   - The goal was to escalate privileges, which aligns with the tactic of "Privilege Escalation".
   - Before conducting internal reconnaissance, the attackers would likely need to obtain credentials, making a credential dumping technique a plausible precursor.
   - Between the options provided, **T1003-OS Credential Dumping** is the most directly related to obtaining credentials from the operating system, which could be used for privilege escalation and subsequent internal reconnaissance.

Final Answer: B
