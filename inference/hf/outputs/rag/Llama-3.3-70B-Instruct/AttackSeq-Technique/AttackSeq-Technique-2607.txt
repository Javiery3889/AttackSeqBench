To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the initial technique used by NanHaiShu to establish communication with the C&C (Command and Control) servers. The communication initially resolves to IP addresses hosted in the United States and later switches to a Chinese IP address. The question specifically mentions the use of HTTP POST for discovery activities after the initial communication is established.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols, T1008-Fallback Channels) and Discovery (T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery). However, none of these directly address the initial establishment of communication with varying IP addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** (Answer Choices A and B) refers to the technique of dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses to establish communication. This could involve resolving a domain name to different IP addresses, which fits the scenario of initially resolving to U.S.-hosted IP addresses and later switching to a Chinese IP address.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** (Answer Choice C) involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which does not directly relate to establishing communication with C&C servers based on IP address resolution.
   - **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** (Answer Choice D) is about capturing input via web portals, which does not align with the scenario of establishing initial communication with C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the initial establishment of communication with C&C servers that involves resolving to different IP addresses.
   - The technique of dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses (T1568-Dynamic Resolution) matches this scenario.
   - Although T1568-Dynamic Resolution is listed as both Answer Choices A and B, the correct answer must relate to the dynamic resolution technique due to its relevance to the scenario described.
   - Therefore, despite the duplication in answer choices, the technique that best fits the description given in the question is T1568-Dynamic Resolution.

Final Answer: A
