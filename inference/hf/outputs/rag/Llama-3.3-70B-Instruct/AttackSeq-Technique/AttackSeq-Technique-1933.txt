To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after libchrome.exe supported credential access by decrypting stored passwords from Local State and Login Data files, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions libchrome.exe, which is related to Google Chrome, decrypting stored passwords. This action is associated with accessing credentials stored in web browsers, which directly relates to the Credential Access tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) is focused on Credential Access, with the specific technique being T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers. This technique involves obtaining credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the action described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves capturing clipboard contents, which might not directly follow the decryption of stored browser passwords unless the attacker is looking for additional information that the user might copy and paste.
   - **B: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves sending malicious attachments via email to gain initial access, which seems unrelated to the post-exploitation action of decrypting browser passwords.
   - **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: Archiving data via a custom method could be a step in exfiltrating the obtained credentials, making it a plausible next step after accessing them.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: Creating a scheduled task could be used for persistence or execution of further malicious activities but doesn't directly relate to the action of accessing credentials unless it's used to repeatedly gather credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action described involves accessing credentials from a web browser, which is a post-exploitation technique aimed at gathering sensitive information.
   - After obtaining these credentials, the next logical steps could involve using them for further malicious activities, such as accessing other systems or exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - Among the provided options, **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** seems the most relevant as a next step because it could involve preparing the obtained credentials for exfiltration or further use, aligning with the goal of credential access.

**Final Answer: C**
