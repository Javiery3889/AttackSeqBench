To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after taking screenshots every minute using a backdoor, uploads harvested sensitive data from removable drives to a Command and Control (C&C) server. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this data upload.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the tactics of Collection and Exfiltration. Specifically, they include:
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from a removable media device.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique is about automatically exfiltrating data from a system.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space** is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of data from removable media or the use of a backdoor for screenshots.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** refers to exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is relevant to uploading data to a C&C server but does not directly address the action before the upload.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** is about capturing input via a web portal, which does not fit the scenario of taking screenshots or collecting data from removable media.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1025-Data from Removable Media** directly relates to the collection of sensitive data from removable drives, which is the action described before the data upload.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the attacker harvested sensitive data from removable drives before uploading it.
   - The technique that directly involves collecting data from removable media is **T1025-Data from Removable Media**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that the attacker used **T1025-Data from Removable Media** to collect the data before uploading it to the C&C server.

Final Answer: D
