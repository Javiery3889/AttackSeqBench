To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when adversaries acquired and prepared infrastructure (such as domains and malware) to support their operations before initiating an attack with spear phishing emails. This indicates we are looking for a technique related to preparation and setup of infrastructure for an attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1590.001-Domain Properties. This suggests activities related to gathering information about domains, which could be part of preparing infrastructure.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This is about the initial access technique using spear phishing with attachments, which is mentioned in the question as the method of attack but is not directly related to preparing infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**: This technique involves creating and using impersonated tokens for authentication, which doesn't directly relate to acquiring and preparing infrastructure like domains and malware.
   - **B: T1608.002-Upload Tool**: This involves uploading tools to a target system, which is more related to post-exploitation activities rather than preparation of infrastructure.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about achieving persistence on a system, not directly related to preparing infrastructure for an attack.
   - **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities, which could include acquiring and preparing infrastructure such as domains and malware to support operations. It aligns with the preparation phase before an attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the preparation phase of an attack, specifically the acquisition and preparation of infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs hint at reconnaissance and initial access techniques but do not directly answer the question about infrastructure preparation.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1587-Develop Capabilities** is the most relevant to preparing infrastructure for an attack, as it involves developing and preparing capabilities (including infrastructure) for future operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before initiating the attack with spear phishing emails would involve developing capabilities.

Final Answer: D
