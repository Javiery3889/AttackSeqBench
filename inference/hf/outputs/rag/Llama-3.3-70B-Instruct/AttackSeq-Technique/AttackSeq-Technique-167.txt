To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses defense evasion methods such as redirecting victims to legitimate services and utilizing domain shortening services. The goal is to access credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals. This implies the attacker is trying to trick victims into revealing their login credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, with a specific technique of **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**. This technique involves capturing user input from web portals, which aligns with the goal of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with a technique of **T1656-Impersonation**. While impersonation is mentioned, the specific technique T1656 is not directly listed in the common ATT&CK framework techniques related to the question's context. However, the concept of impersonation is relevant as it involves making phishing pages appear as legitimate login portals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**: This technique involves accessing Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which doesn't directly relate to the phishing scenario described.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique is about using a proxy to hide the attacker's identity or location, which is more related to defense evasion than directly accessing credentials through phishing.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This involves developing capabilities for the attacker, which is too broad and not directly related to the specific action of accessing credentials through phishing.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique is about capturing user input, which can include credentials entered into phishing pages. Given the context of the related TTPs, especially **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**, this seems closely related to the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario focused on accessing credentials through phishing, which is a form of input capture.
   - The related TTPs highlight the tactic of credential access and specifically mention web portal capture, which aligns with the scenario.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1056-Input Capture** is the most relevant to capturing credentials from phishing pages impersonating login portals.

Final Answer: D
