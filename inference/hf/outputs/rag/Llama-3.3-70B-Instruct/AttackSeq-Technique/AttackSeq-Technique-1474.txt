To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the SLUB backdoor communicated with the attackers via Slack, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, known as SLUB, uses hardcoded authentication tokens to communicate with attackers through a private Slack channel. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the system and are using an unconventional method (Slack) for command and control (C2) communications.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This suggests the use of chat messages for obtaining credentials, which could be related to how the attackers initially gained access or how they maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This indicates that there is a two-way communication channel established between the compromised system and the attackers, which aligns with the SLUB backdoor's functionality.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This implies that the attackers have set up alternative channels for C2 in case the primary method is discovered or blocked.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data, which doesn't directly relate to the communication method used by the SLUB backdoor.
   - **B: T1588.004-Digital Certificates**: This involves using digital certificates for authentication, which could be relevant in some C2 scenarios but doesn't directly explain the use of Slack for communication.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding to hide communications, which could be relevant as using Slack (a chat platform) for C2 is non-standard and might involve encoding messages in a way that avoids detection.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols for C2, which could apply since Slack uses HTTP/HTTPS (application layer protocols) for communication. However, this is more about the protocol layer than the method of communication itself.

Given the context that the SLUB backdoor uses a non-standard method (Slack) for communication, which might involve hiding or encoding the communication to avoid detection, **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** seems the most relevant. This technique would likely be used to ensure that the communication between the SLUB backdoor and the attackers via Slack remains undetected, possibly by encoding the messages or commands in a way that they blend in with normal Slack traffic.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the key elements of the question: SLUB backdoor, communication via Slack, hardcoded authentication tokens.
2. Analyze related TTPs for context on tactics and techniques that might precede such communication.
3. Evaluate answer choices based on relevance to the scenario described.
4. Select the technique that best aligns with the need for covert communication channels and the use of non-standard methods for C2.

**Final Answer: C**
