To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used process hollowing (a technique for defense evasion) to evade detection while executing a second-stage payload on an infected host. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the malware began collecting information about active processes on the host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Defense Evasion) and a technique (T1055.012 - Process Hollowing), which is a method used by attackers to evade detection by injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. This context suggests the attacker is already on the host and is taking steps to remain undetected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1098.002 - Additional Email Delegate Permissions**: This technique involves adding permissions to a user's mailbox to access their email content. It doesn't directly relate to collecting information about active processes on a host.
   - **B: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is about secure communication between the malware and its command and control (C2) server, not about process discovery.
   - **C: T1012 - Query Registry**: While querying the registry can provide valuable information, it's more about gathering system configuration data rather than specifically focusing on active processes.
   - **D: T1057 - Process Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to get a list of running processes on the system, which aligns with the goal of collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that after evading detection, the malware started collecting information about active processes.
   - Process hollowing (T1055.012) is used for defense evasion, which is mentioned in the scenario.
   - Among the given options, **T1057 - Process Discovery** is the technique that directly involves collecting information about running processes on a system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question, is that after using process hollowing for defense evasion, the malware would use **T1057 - Process Discovery** to gather information about active processes.

Final Answer: D
