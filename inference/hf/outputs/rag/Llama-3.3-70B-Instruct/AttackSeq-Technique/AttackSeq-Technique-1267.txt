To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Blind Eagle utilized a JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands and before achieving persistence with a VBScript placed in the Startup folder, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by Blind Eagle, starting with the use of a JavaScript downloader that utilizes ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. This indicates an initial execution phase where the attacker gains code execution on the victim's system. The end goal mentioned is achieving persistence through a VBScript in the Startup folder, which aligns with the technique of using Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder for persistence (T1547.001).

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the initial action described in the question where PowerShell commands are executed.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This is related to achieving persistence, which is the final step mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute malicious code. Given that the initial step involves using ActiveXObject (which is a part of COM) to execute PowerShell, this could be a plausible next step in the sequence as it involves further exploitation of system components for malicious execution.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2). While this could be part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of achieving execution and then persistence as described.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared modules to evade detection. It's not directly related to the execution or persistence methods described in the question.
   - **D: T1218.007-Msiexec**: This technique involves using the Windows Installer (msiexec) for execution. While it's an execution technique, it doesn't directly follow from the use of PowerShell execution and the goal of achieving persistence via a VBScript in the Startup folder.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action involves executing PowerShell commands, which is an execution tactic.
   - The goal is to achieve persistence, which is indicated by the use of a VBScript in the Startup folder.
   - Among the given choices, **T1559.001-Component Object Model** is the most relevant to the sequence because it involves using system components (like ActiveXObject) for malicious purposes, which aligns with the initial execution method and could logically precede achieving persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves utilizing system components for further execution or manipulation before establishing persistence.

Final Answer: A
