To solve this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, BlueDelta, is in the process of exfiltrating data. Before automating this exfiltration, the attacker collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin. This filter forwards incoming emails to an attacker-controlled email address. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this email collection method.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the "Collection" tactic, which involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1114-Email Collection**: Involves collecting email from a mailbox or email client.
   - **T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: A sub-technique of email collection, focusing on collecting emails from a local email client.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: Involves setting up a rule to automatically forward emails to another account, which is exactly what is described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the question describes the creation of an email forwarding rule to collect emails, we are looking for a technique that would logically follow this action in the context of exfiltrating data. The answer choices provided are:
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data hard to detect, which doesn't directly follow the action of collecting emails.
   - **B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data, which aligns with the automation of the exfiltration process mentioned in the question but doesn't directly relate to the email collection method described.
   - **C: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over encrypted channels, which could be a method used after collecting emails but doesn't directly follow the described action.
   - **D: T1543.004-Launch Daemon**: This technique is not directly related to the context of email collection or the described actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: 
   - The question describes a specific action of email collection through creating a forwarding rule.
   - The related TTPs highlight the collection tactic, specifically email collection and the use of email forwarding rules.
   - The answer choices should be evaluated based on what logically follows the collection of emails through a forwarding rule in the context of exfiltrating data.
   - Given the context, **B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most relevant technique that would occur after collecting emails, as it involves automating the exfiltration process, which aligns with the scenario described where BlueDelta automates the exfiltration of data after collecting emails.

Final Answer: B
