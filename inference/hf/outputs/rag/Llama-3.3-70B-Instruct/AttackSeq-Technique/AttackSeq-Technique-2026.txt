To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access but before the Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The Duke group used 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails to gain initial access to high-profile government networks. This indicates a phishing campaign aimed at tricking users into divulging credentials or executing malicious code, which aligns with initial access techniques such as T1566: Phishing.

2. **Related TTPs and Context**: The provided Related TTPs mention "Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket" and "Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket". This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers focused on moving laterally within the network and evading defenses, with a specific mention of using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

3. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising as a legitimate process or service to evade detection. While masquerading can be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions taken immediately before leveraging Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
   - **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique is about exfiltrating data using web services. Given the context, the attackers were focused on gaining access and moving laterally before exfiltrating data, making this less likely as the immediate step before pass-the-ticket attacks.
   - **C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This option seems unrelated to the immediate context of leveraging Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and is more specific to .NET applications, which doesn't directly fit the described sequence.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. Given that the attackers were preparing to use Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks, which is a method to gain credential access without being detected, hiding artifacts (such as hiding the fact that they are using stolen tickets) would be a plausible step to take before executing such an attack to maintain stealth.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the context provided and the need for the attackers to remain undetected while preparing to leverage Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks, the most logical technique that would occur before such an action is hiding artifacts to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
