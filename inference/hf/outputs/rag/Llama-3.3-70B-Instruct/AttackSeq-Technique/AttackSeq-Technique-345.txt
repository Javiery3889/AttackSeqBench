To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that followed after UNC2452 gained Initial Access via a compromised software supply chain to execute malicious code within the SolarWinds Orion platform, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question specifies that the initial access was gained through a compromised software supply chain, which led to the execution of malicious code within the SolarWinds Orion platform. This implies that the attackers exploited a vulnerability or manipulated the software update process of SolarWinds Orion to inject their malicious code.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are T1195-Supply Chain Compromise and T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain, both of which are techniques under the Initial Access tactic. These techniques involve compromising the supply chain of a product to gain access to the target organization's network. This aligns with the scenario described, where the attackers compromised the SolarWinds software supply chain.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute commands or programs. While it could be a part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a compromised software supply chain to execute malicious code within a specific platform like SolarWinds Orion.
   - **B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique is about acquiring infrastructure for use in attacks, which doesn't directly follow the initial access via a compromised software supply chain.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malicious code. Given that the attackers compromised the SolarWinds Orion platform through its software supply chain, using the platform's own update mechanism (a form of software deployment tool) to execute malicious code is highly plausible.
   - **D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order of dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code. While it's a method to execute malicious code, it's more specific to a particular type of exploitation and doesn't directly relate to the broader scenario of exploiting a software supply chain compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers compromised the SolarWinds software supply chain, which suggests they manipulated the software update process.
   - The goal was to execute malicious code within the SolarWinds Orion platform, which is a software deployment scenario.
   - Among the provided options, **T1072-Software Deployment Tools** is the most relevant technique that aligns with using a compromised software supply chain to execute malicious code, as it involves utilizing the software deployment mechanisms of the compromised platform.

Final Answer: C
