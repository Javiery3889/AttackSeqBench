To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after FIN7 gained initial access, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Access**: The initial access was gained through a phishing email, which aligns with the Tactic "Initial Access" and Technique "T1566-Phishing". This is the starting point of the attack sequence.

2. **Phishing Email Content**: The phishing email used a VBS (Visual Basic Script) script to drop and launch a JavaScript backdoor. This indicates that after the initial access, the attackers used scripting to execute their malicious payload.

3. **Execution Techniques**: Given that a VBS script was used to launch a JavaScript backdoor, we can relate this to the Execution tactic. The techniques mentioned under Execution that are relevant are T1059.007 (JavaScript) for the backdoor and T1059.005 (Visual Basic) for the VBS script used in the initial stages of the attack.

4. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**: This technique involves modifying firmware to gain persistence. While persistence is a crucial aspect of an attack, the immediate next step after gaining access and executing scripts would not typically involve firmware modification.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols. While data exfiltration is a common goal of attacks, the question focuses on the immediate actions following initial access and script execution.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is a broader technique that encompasses the use of scripting languages like JavaScript and Visual Basic for execution. Given that the attackers have already used a VBS script to launch a JavaScript backdoor, this technique aligns closely with the actions described.
   - **D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using malicious links to gain access. Since the question describes the initial access method (phishing email with a VBS script), looking for a malicious link as the next step doesn't directly follow the sequence of executing scripts post-initial access.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis of the techniques, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access through a phishing email that used a VBS script to drop and launch a JavaScript backdoor would involve further execution or utilization of scripting interpreters to achieve the attacker's goals.

Final Answer: C
