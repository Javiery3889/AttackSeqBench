To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after gathering internal reconnaissance data (such as system architecture and open TCP/UDP tables) from a victim machine, securely transmits this data to a Command and Control (C&C) domain. The focus here is on the secure transmission of the collected data to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer) and Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). These TTPs suggest methods used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems and to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While encoding could be a part of the process, the question emphasizes secure transmission, not just encoding.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which doesn't directly relate to the secure transmission of data to a C&C server.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which aligns with the concept of securely transmitting data to a C&C domain.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about discovering system information, which is what was done before the transmission but not the transmission itself.

Given the context of securely transmitting data to a C&C domain, the most relevant technique is establishing an encrypted channel for this communication. This ensures that the data is protected during transmission, aligning with the description provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the secure transmission of data to a C&C server.
   - The related TTPs suggest a context of command and control and exfiltration techniques.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly addresses the need for secure transmission, which is crucial for protecting the data during exfiltration to the C&C domain.
   
Final Answer: C
