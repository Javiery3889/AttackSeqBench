To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the successful execution of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses. This implies we are looking for a technique related to evading defenses after the initial execution of malware through Office Macro Scripts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with a technique of **T1036.009-Break Process Trees**. This suggests that the attackers are trying to evade detection by manipulating process trees.
   - **Tactic: Execution**, with a technique of **T1059.005-Visual Basic**, which is related to using Visual Basic (like in Office Macro Scripts) for execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access, which doesn't directly relate to evading detection after the malware is loaded.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is a broader category that includes the use of scripting interpreters, which could be relevant but doesn't specifically address evasion.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into a process in a way that makes it difficult for security tools to detect, fitting the context of evading detection.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which could be used for evasion but is more about redirecting the execution path than loading malware reflectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of Office Macro Scripts to load malware, indicating an initial execution vector.
   - The focus is on evading detection after this initial execution, pointing towards a defense evasion technique.
   - Among the provided options, **T1620-Reflective Code Loading** directly addresses loading code in a manner designed to evade detection, which aligns with the goal of loading malware without alerting defenses after initial execution.

**Final Answer: C**
