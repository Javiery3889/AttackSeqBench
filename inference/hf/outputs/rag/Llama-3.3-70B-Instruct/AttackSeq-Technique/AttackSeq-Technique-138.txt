To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, APT-TOCS, has already gained access to an internal network and is using lateral movement to conduct attacks. After this phase, but before communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests, we are looking for the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This indicates the use of remote services to move laterally within the network, which aligns with the initial phase of the attack described.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control, which matches the final phase of the attack described, where HTTP GET requests are used.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools within the network, which could be necessary for further exploitation or movement but doesn't directly relate to the communication method described at the end.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**: This could be a step to facilitate lateral movement or communication by reducing security controls, but it's not directly implied by the need to communicate using HTTP GET requests.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is about exploiting applications that are publicly accessible, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of already being inside the network and then communicating with compromised systems.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This is a broader category that includes using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of HTTP GET requests but is more general than the specific technique mentioned in the related TTPs (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel could be a step to secure command and control communications, which might precede or follow the use of HTTP GET requests, especially if the attackers want to hide their communications.

Given the context that the attackers are already inside the network and are looking to communicate with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests, the most relevant technique that would logically occur before this step, considering the need for secure or covert communication, would involve setting up a means to communicate without being detected.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attackers have already moved laterally within the network.
2. They need to communicate with compromised systems.
3. The method of communication is via HTTP GET requests, which might not be secure on its own.
4. Establishing an encrypted channel would provide a secure means of communication.

**Final Answer**: D
