To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary, PROMETHIUM, uses its Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate over HTTPS with self-signed certificates. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to send encoded archives containing collected documents to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols), Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), and Resource Development (T1587.003-Digital Certificates). These TTPs suggest the use of web protocols for C2 communication and the potential for exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1565.002-Transmitted Data Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying data in transit, which doesn't directly relate to the act of sending encoded archives to a C2 server.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel used for command and control. Given that the question mentions sending encoded archives to the C2 server, this seems like a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative network paths that are not typically used for command and control. The question specifically mentions using the C2 infrastructure, making this less likely.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: While encryption is implied through the use of HTTPS and self-signed certificates, the question asks about the technique for sending encoded archives, not establishing an encrypted channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of sending encoded archives to the C2 server.
   - The use of HTTPS with self-signed certificates (related to T1587.003-Digital Certificates) suggests an established, potentially encrypted channel.
   - T1071.001-Web Protocols supports the use of web protocols for C2, which aligns with the HTTPS communication mentioned.
   - Given the context of exfiltrating data (encoded archives) over the established C2 channel, **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the most relevant technique.

Final Answer: B
