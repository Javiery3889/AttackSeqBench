To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the InfoOS module gathered system information and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups for Discovery, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the InfoOS module gathered system information, and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups. This information gathering is related to the Discovery tactic, which involves collecting information about the target system or network to understand its configuration, vulnerabilities, and potential entry points for further exploitation.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided Related TTPs include:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery. This technique involves collecting information about the system, which aligns with the actions of the InfoOS module.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery. This technique involves identifying the software installed on a system, which aligns with the RemoteShell module's action of listing installed applications.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the origin of the attacker's traffic. While it could be used in various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly follow the discovery of system and software information as a logical next step in the Discovery tactic.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the running processes on a system. Given that system information and software have been discovered, the next logical step could involve looking into the processes running on the system to understand its current state and potential vulnerabilities or entry points.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input through the graphical user interface. While it's a method of gathering information, it seems less directly related to the sequence of system and software discovery.
   - **D: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. Like proxying, it's more about gathering information from network communications rather than directly following the discovery of system and software information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes actions related to the Discovery tactic, specifically gathering system and software information.
   - The next logical step after discovering system information (T1082) and software (T1518) would be to understand the current state of the system, which includes knowing what processes are running.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** directly aligns with this logical progression, as it involves identifying the processes running on the system, which can reveal additional information about potential vulnerabilities, running services, and applications that could be exploited.

Final Answer: B
