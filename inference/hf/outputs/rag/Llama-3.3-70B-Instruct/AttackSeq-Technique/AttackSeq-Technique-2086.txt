To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before RIG EK (Exploit Kit) initiated its Initial Access through drive-by compromise. This implies we are looking for a preparatory step or technique that would enable or precede the drive-by compromise.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Initial Access" and "Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise." This context tells us that the attack is in its early stages, focusing on gaining initial access to a system or network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves obtaining code signing certificates to make malicious software appear legitimate. While this could be a part of an attack chain, it's not directly related to the initial access via drive-by compromise.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or other capabilities that can be used to support an attack. This could potentially include exploit kits like RIG EK, suggesting a preparation step before the actual initial access attempt.
   - **C: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't directly relate to drive-by compromise or the use of an exploit kit for initial access.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is more relevant to command and control (C2) communications after initial access has been gained, rather than a step that precedes initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique that occurred before the drive-by compromise.
   - Drive-by compromise (T1189) is a technique used for initial access, indicating the attack is at its beginning phase.
   - Among the given options, **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** is the most relevant as a preparatory step. An attacker would need to obtain or have access to an exploit kit like RIG EK before they can use it to compromise systems through drive-by attacks.
   - Therefore, obtaining the capabilities (in this case, the RIG EK) would logically precede the actual drive-by compromise attempt.

Final Answer: B
