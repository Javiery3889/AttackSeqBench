To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by the Dropping Elephant group to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique is about establishing fallback channels for command and control (C2) communications in case the primary channel is compromised. It doesn't directly relate to gathering information about targets before initial access.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This involves scanning IP blocks to gather information about potential targets. While it could be part of reconnaissance, it's more about network reconnaissance rather than specifically gathering information about entities.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the target, including their identity, which can be crucial for crafting targeted spear-phishing campaigns. This seems directly relevant to the scenario described, where the attackers need to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before launching a targeted attack.
   - **D: T1074-Data Staged**: This technique is about staging data in a location that can be accessed by the adversary, typically after initial access has been gained. It doesn't fit the pre-initial access information gathering described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about gathering information before initial access, which suggests the need for reconnaissance or information gathering techniques.
   - The provided TTPs indicate a focus on exploitation and initial access via spear-phishing, suggesting that the information gathering would be targeted towards identifying and profiling potential victims.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the most relevant to the scenario described, as it directly involves gathering information about the targets, which is necessary for crafting effective spear-phishing emails.

Final Answer: C
