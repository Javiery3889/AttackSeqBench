To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection, specifically after setting up communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are all under the "Command and Control" tactic, which involves techniques an adversary uses to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: Using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: Using protocol tunneling to hide C2 communication.
   - **T1071.004-DNS**: Using DNS for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage** is related to storing tools or data in a way that makes them difficult to detect, which doesn't directly relate to the communication process with C&C servers.
   - **B & C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer** involves transferring data to and from the C2 server at a scheduled time, which could be part of maintaining operational security but doesn't directly address the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** involves using encryption to protect C2 communications, which directly aligns with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers, which implies the use of encryption.
   - The related TTPs all pertain to Command and Control, focusing on different methods of communication.
   - Given the emphasis on a custom cryptographic protocol, the most relevant technique is the one that directly involves encryption for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection is the one related to creating an encrypted channel for communication.

Final Answer: D
