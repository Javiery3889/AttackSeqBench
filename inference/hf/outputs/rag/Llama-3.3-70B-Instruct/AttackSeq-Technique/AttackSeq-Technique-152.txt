To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already captured credentials through keylogging (T1056.001) and OS credential dumping (T1003) techniques. They then use the PowerLess Backdoor for lateral movement within the network. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before leveraging the PowerLess Backdoor.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the "Credential Access" tactic, specifically keylogging (T1056.001) and OS credential dumping (T1003). These techniques are used to gain access to credentials, which is a precursor to using those credentials for further malicious activities like lateral movement.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material (like certificates, tokens) that have been obtained or created to access systems. Given that the attackers have already captured credentials, this could be a plausible next step if those credentials are used as alternate authentication material.
   - **B & C: T1087 - Account Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to get a listing of accounts on a system or within an environment. While account discovery could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly relate to the use of captured credentials for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1556.002 - Password Filter DLL**: This technique involves modifying the password filter to capture password hashes. While related to credential access, it's more about capturing credentials rather than using them for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already obtained credentials through keylogging and OS credential dumping.
   - The next logical step for lateral movement would involve using those credentials.
   - Using alternate authentication material (T1550) directly aligns with leveraging captured credentials for further access, such as lateral movement within the network.
   - Account discovery (T1087) is more about reconnaissance and doesn't directly follow the capture of credentials in the context of using them for lateral movement.
   - Password Filter DLL (T1556.002) is another method of capturing credentials, not using them.

**Final Answer: A**
