To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Sayad malware communicates with its Command and Control (C2) server to upload collected data. The specific action in question is how the encrypted data is uploaded to a malicious web server. This implies we are looking for a technique related to data exfiltration, specifically over a web service or channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs give us context:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This suggests the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This implies automated methods are used for exfiltrating data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This directly mentions exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario of uploading data to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which could include uploading data to a web server. Given the context of uploading encrypted data to a malicious web server, this seems highly relevant.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about discovering system information, which does not directly relate to the action of uploading data to a web server.
   - **C: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves spearphishing with an attachment, which is not relevant to the scenario of uploading data to a server.
   - **D: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique is about data transfer size limits, which, while potentially relevant in a broader context of data exfiltration, does not directly explain how data is uploaded to a web server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about the technique used for uploading encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - The related TTPs provide context that involves exfiltration and the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** directly addresses the action of exfiltrating data over a web service, which aligns with uploading data to a web server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the described action is exfiltration over a web service.

Final Answer: A
