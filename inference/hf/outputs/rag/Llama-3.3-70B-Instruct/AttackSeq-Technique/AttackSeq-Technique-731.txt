To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely supported hiding the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the technique used to hide the location of a C&C ('mothership') server. This implies we are looking for a method that involves concealing or obfuscating the true location or identity of the command and control server to avoid detection.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using a name or location that is similar to a legitimate one to blend in and avoid detection. While this is about evasion, it's more related to making something appear legitimate rather than directly hiding a server's location.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This involves using network devices for malicious purposes but doesn't directly relate to hiding server locations.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique is about having alternative channels for command and control in case the primary one is compromised. It's relevant to C&C communications but not directly about hiding server locations.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using existing command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. It doesn't directly relate to hiding server locations.
   - **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: Dead drop resolvers are used in the context of hiding communication channels, which could involve hiding the location of a C&C server by using intermediate points of communication.
   - **C: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the true location of a server. Proxies can be used to obfuscate the IP address of the C&C server, making it harder to track.
   - **D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique is related to persistence and privilege escalation on a Windows system and does not directly relate to hiding server locations.

Given the context of hiding the location of a 'mothership' server, the most relevant techniques would be those that directly involve obfuscating or hiding the identity or location of the server. Between the options provided, **T1090-Proxy** is the most directly related to hiding the location of a server by acting as an intermediary, making it difficult to trace back to the original server.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the goal: Hide the C&C server location.
2. Analyze related TTPs for relevance to hiding locations or evasion.
3. Evaluate answer choices for direct relevance to hiding server locations.
4. Select the technique that best matches the requirement for obfuscating server locations.

**Final Answer: C**
