To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where attackers send spear phishing emails that exploit Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access through the victim opening OLE2 format attachments.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Initial Access
   - Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

   This indicates the attack is focused on gaining initial access to a system or network through spearphishing, specifically using attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host system, which could be a step after initial access is gained to plan further actions.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique of using phishing to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing certain actions. Given that the question mentions spear phishing emails, this seems directly relevant but the question asks for the technique before gaining initial access through the phishing.
   - **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: Similar to T1592, this involves gathering information about the victim's network, which might occur after initial access is established to understand the network layout and plan lateral movement.
   - **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative credentials or authentication materials to gain access, which doesn't directly relate to the initial step of sending phishing emails to exploit Microsoft Word features.

   Given the context, **T1566-Phishing** (specifically **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**) is the technique being used to gain initial access. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **before** gaining initial access through the victim opening the attachments. Since the attack involves sending spear phishing emails as the initial vector, the act of sending these emails (phishing) is the action taken to gain access, not a separate step that occurs before access is gained in this context.

   The question seems to imply a search for a technique that precedes the phishing attempt in the attack chain, which might involve reconnaissance or preparation. However, based on the provided options and the context that the phishing is the initial access technique, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in how the question is framed regarding the sequence of events.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an attack starting with spear phishing emails.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of spearphishing attachments for initial access.
   - Given the options, **B: T1566-Phishing** is the technique that directly involves the action described (sending spear phishing emails), but the question's phrasing suggests looking for a preceding step, which isn't clearly differentiated in the provided options based on standard ATT&CK framework usage.
   - Since the question asks for the technique before gaining initial access and given that **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** is the method of gaining initial access, it seems there's a confusion in the question's intent. Normally, phishing (including spearphishing) is considered the initial access technique itself, not something that follows another technique in the sequence provided.

Given the above analysis and the direct mention of spearphishing in the context of initial access, the most fitting answer based on the information provided and standard interpretations of the ATT&CK framework would be related to the phishing activity itself, as it's the described method of initial access. However, strictly following the question's logic and the provided options, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the sequence of events as typically defined by the ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: B**
