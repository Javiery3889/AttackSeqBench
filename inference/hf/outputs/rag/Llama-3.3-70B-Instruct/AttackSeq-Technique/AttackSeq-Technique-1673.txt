To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for the execution phase of the WastedLocker attack. This implies that the attackers had already gained some level of access to the system to execute PowerShell commands.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1059.001-PowerShell". This indicates that the focus is on how the attackers executed their payload or tools on the compromised system, specifically using PowerShell.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is a broader technique that includes using command and scripting interpreters like PowerShell, but it's more general and doesn't specify the exact method of gaining access to execute these commands.
   - **B: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This is a sub-technique of T1059 and specifically refers to using the Windows Command Shell. While related to command execution, the question specifically mentions PowerShell, which aligns more closely with T1059.001.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands on a system. Given that the attackers were able to use PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike, it's plausible that they used remote services to initially gain access to the system, allowing them to execute commands remotely.
   - **D: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle**: This technique involves positioning oneself between two parties to intercept or alter communications. While this could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the execution of commands on a compromised system using PowerShell.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the execution phase using PowerShell.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of PowerShell for execution.
   - To execute commands via PowerShell, especially in the context of deploying tools like Cobalt Strike, the attackers must have had prior access to the system.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** provides a plausible method for gaining this initial access, allowing the attackers to execute commands remotely, which aligns with the subsequent use of PowerShell for deploying Cobalt Strike.

**Final Answer: C**
