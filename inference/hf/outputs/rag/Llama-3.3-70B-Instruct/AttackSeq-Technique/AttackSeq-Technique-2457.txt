To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Metamorfo evaded defenses, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Metamorfo evades defenses by abusing legitimate signed binaries to load malicious code and uses public cloud infrastructure for malicious payload delivery. This indicates a sophisticated evasion technique involving the misuse of legitimate processes or files to remain undetected.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to Defense Evasion tactics, which aligns with the evasion techniques described in the question. Specifically:
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location** involves masquerading files or directories to blend in with the environment.
   - **T1553.002-Code Signing** refers to the use of code signing certificates to make malicious code appear legitimate.
   - **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading** is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded by a legitimate program, allowing the malicious code to execute under the guise of the legitimate program.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1204-User Execution** involves tricking users into executing malicious files or code, which doesn't directly relate to the abuse of legitimate signed binaries or the use of public cloud infrastructure for payload delivery.
   - **B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution** refers to the use of system binaries to execute malicious payloads, which aligns closely with the abuse of legitimate signed binaries to load malicious code.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** involves encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection, which doesn't directly relate to the specific evasion techniques mentioned.
   - **D: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller** is about creating a fake domain controller to manipulate authentication, which doesn't fit the context of abusing legitimate binaries or using cloud infrastructure for payload delivery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of abusing legitimate signed binaries and using public cloud infrastructure, the most relevant technique that would occur before such evasion would involve setting up or preparing the environment for these evasion techniques.
   - **T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution (B)** directly relates to the concept of using legitimate system binaries to execute malicious code, which is a key part of the described evasion technique.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that before Metamorfo could evade defenses by abusing legitimate signed binaries, it would need to execute its malicious payload through system binaries, making **B: T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution** the most likely preceding technique.

Final Answer: B
