To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial access vector where a spear phishing email contains a spreadsheet with a malicious macro. Upon execution, this macro downloads and executes malicious files, starting the infection chain. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this initial execution.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   These TTPs indicate the initial access method involves phishing, specifically spearphishing with an attachment, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1569.002-Service Execution**: This technique involves executing a command or program by leveraging a service, which could potentially be a step after initial access to maintain persistence or escalate privileges but doesn't directly relate to the immediate execution of malicious files downloaded by a macro.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious files or programs, which aligns closely with the scenario where a user opens a malicious spreadsheet, enabling the macro to download and execute malicious files.
   - **C: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves performing system checks to gather information about the system, which might occur after initial access but doesn't directly relate to the execution of malicious files.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon, which could be a step for persistence but doesn't directly follow the execution of malicious files by a macro.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access is gained through spearphishing with a malicious attachment (a spreadsheet with a macro).
   - The macro, upon execution, downloads and executes malicious files, starting the infection chain.
   - The most direct and immediate technique following the execution of malicious files by a macro, facilitated by user interaction (opening the spreadsheet and enabling the macro), is **T1204-User Execution**. This is because the user's action (enabling the macro) directly leads to the execution of the malicious files, fitting the description of user execution.

Final Answer: B
