To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary uses credential stuffing to gain access to a victim's VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points. We're asked to identify the MITRE ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated this tactic to gain access to these services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Initial Access) and a technique (T1133-External Remote Services). This indicates that the attack is focused on gaining initial access to the network through external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems or services. Given that credential stuffing provides the adversary with valid credentials, this technique aligns with the scenario described.
   - **T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This sub-technique is related to hiding malicious email activity, which does not directly relate to accessing network services via credential stuffing.
   - **T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or control, which is not relevant to the scenario of using credential stuffing to access remote services.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information about the system, which, while potentially useful after gaining access, does not directly facilitate the initial access through credential stuffing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions gaining access to remote services after credential stuffing, which implies the use of valid (though compromised) credentials.
   - T1078-Valid Accounts is directly related to using valid credentials to access systems or services, which aligns with the outcome of a successful credential stuffing attack.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the act of using compromised credentials to access remote services.

Final Answer: A
