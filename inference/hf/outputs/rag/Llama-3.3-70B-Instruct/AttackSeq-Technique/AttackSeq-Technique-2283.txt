To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Regin, a sophisticated malware, has already gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic. This information gathering is crucial for its discovery capabilities, suggesting that the malware is in the process of understanding the environment it has compromised. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this information gathering but before the malware captured credentials by analyzing network traffic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information about the network and its hosts. It aligns with the initial actions described in the question, where Regin monitors network traffic.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique is about blocking indicators that might be used to detect the malware, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gathering information and capturing credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving data via a library, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of monitoring network traffic and then capturing credentials.
   - **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**: Given that Regin has already been monitoring network traffic, this option seems like a continuation of its actions rather than a new step. However, it's directly related to analyzing network traffic, which could lead to capturing credentials.
   - **C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. While it's a method for capturing credentials, it doesn't directly follow from monitoring network traffic in the context provided.
   - **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the network connections of a system, which could be a step after initial network traffic monitoring and before deeper credential capture methods, as it helps in understanding the network layout and potential targets for credential capture.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a sequence where Regin is gathering information and then moves towards capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic.
   - **T1040-Network Sniffing (B)** is directly related to analyzing network traffic, which could be both a precursor to and a method for capturing credentials, making it a strong candidate.
   - However, considering the sequence and the need for a technique that logically precedes credential capture (like analyzing LSASS memory or directly capturing credentials from network traffic), **T1040-Network Sniffing** seems to be the action that aligns best with the described sequence, as it directly involves analyzing network traffic which can lead to credential capture.

Final Answer: B
