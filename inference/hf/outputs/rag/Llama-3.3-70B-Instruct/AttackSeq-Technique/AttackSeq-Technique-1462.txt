To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Tildeb, a 32-bit console Windows executable, executes and establishes communication with a command and control (C&C) server using command-line arguments. The focus is on the setup of a secure communication channel with encrypted traffic to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encryption to protect C&C communications, making it difficult for defenders to detect and intercept.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves executing commands via the Windows Command Shell, which could be relevant to how Tildeb operates but doesn't directly address the encryption aspect.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This is a sub-technique of T1573, specifically focusing on the use of symmetric cryptography for encrypting C&C communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique is about removing indicators that could be used to detect the adversary's presence. It doesn't directly relate to establishing a secure communication channel.
   - **B: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This involves using Visual Basic for execution, which doesn't directly pertain to the establishment of encrypted communication channels.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C&C communications, which could involve encryption but is broader and not as directly related to encryption as T1573.
   - **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used for C&C, which might involve encryption but is more focused on concealing the infrastructure itself.

Given the context of establishing a secure communication channel with encrypted traffic, the most relevant technique from the provided options that aligns with the related TTPs (especially T1573-Encrypted Channel and its sub-technique T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography) is not directly listed. However, based on the information provided and the focus on encrypted communication, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the closest in the context of using protocols for communication, which could include encryption, even though it's not a perfect match.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question emphasizes the establishment of a secure, encrypted communication channel.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of encrypted channels and symmetric cryptography for C&C communications.
   - None of the answer choices directly match the described techniques (T1573-Encrypted Channel and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography), but we need to select the closest based on the context provided.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the closest in terms of relevance to communication protocols, which could encompass encrypted communications, even though it's broader than the specific techniques mentioned.

**Final Answer: C**
