To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary group, TG-3279, has already gained access to a network, is using specific tools (Conpee or Etso), and has added scheduled system tasks using compromised credentials. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated Command and Control (C2) communication over port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided point towards the "Command and Control" tactic and specifically highlight the technique T1571-Non-Standard Port. This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which can help evade detection by traditional security monitoring tools that expect C2 traffic on standard ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols for C2 communication, which doesn't directly relate to using a non-standard port like 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**: Active scanning is about gathering information about the target environment, not about establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique directly relates to using ports in a non-standard way for C2 communication. Using port 443 (typically used for HTTPS) for non-HTTPS traffic fits this description, as it's an attempt to blend in with legitimate traffic while not using the standard protocol expected on that port.
   - **D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This involves obtaining infrastructure for use in operations, which doesn't directly relate to the method of C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which indicates an attempt to use a standard port in a non-standard way for C2 communication.
   - The related TTPs highlight the "Command and Control" tactic and specifically mention T1571-Non-Standard Port.
   - Given the context, the most appropriate technique that aligns with using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic as a means of C2 communication is T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Final Answer: C
