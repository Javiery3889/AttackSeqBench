To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul botnet maintains persistence and communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server at the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz. The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique used when the botnet communicates with this C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the tactic of Command and Control, focusing on techniques used for communication between the malware and the C2 server. Specifically, the techniques mentioned are:
   - T1071: Application Layer Protocol, which involves using application-layer protocols for C2 communication.
   - T1071.001: Web Protocols, a sub-technique of T1071, which involves using web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - T1071.004: DNS, another sub-technique of T1071, which involves using DNS for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This is a broad category that includes any application-layer protocol used for C2 communication, such as HTTP, FTP, or in this case, potentially IRC (Internet Relay Chat), given the "irc" in the domain name.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing the resolution of DNS records to evade detection, which is not directly related to the method of communication itself but rather to how the C2 server's location is obscured.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is about scheduling tasks on the victim's system for persistence or execution of malicious code, not directly related to C2 communication.
   - **D: T1547.003-Time Providers**: This involves manipulating time settings on a compromised system, which is unrelated to the communication with a C2 server.

Given the context of communicating with a C2 server and the mention of a specific domain (irc[.]localroot[.]xyz), the most relevant technique is related to how the communication is facilitated, which points towards the use of an application-layer protocol for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Tuyul botnet's communication with its C2 server at irc[.]localroot[.]xyz suggests the use of an application-layer protocol.
   - The "irc" in the domain name implies the use of Internet Relay Chat, which is an application-layer protocol.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that encompasses the use of such protocols for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of an application-layer protocol for communication with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
