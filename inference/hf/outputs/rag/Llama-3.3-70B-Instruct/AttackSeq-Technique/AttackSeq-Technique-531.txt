To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after London Blue's BEC (Business Email Compromise) attempt was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: London Blue is known for BEC attacks, which often involve spearphishing and impersonation to trick victims into transferring funds. The fact that an attempt was blocked suggests the attackers might try alternative methods to achieve their goals.

2. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This suggests the attackers are developing resources, possibly creating or compromising email accounts to use in their attacks.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: The ultimate goal of BEC attacks is often financial theft, indicating the direction of the attack.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This is a common initial access technique used by attackers to gain a foothold, but in this case, the attempt was blocked.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This involves searching closed sources or proprietary information. While it could be part of an attacker's reconnaissance, it doesn't directly follow a blocked BEC attempt in a straightforward manner.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data in a remote location, which might not directly relate to the immediate next steps after a blocked email attempt.
   - **C: T1578.001-Create Snapshot**: Creating a snapshot could be related to various activities, including reconnaissance or exfiltration, but it doesn't directly connect to the context of a blocked BEC attempt.
   - **D: T1656-Impersonation**: Given that the blocked attempt was a BEC, which heavily relies on impersonation, and considering the attackers' goal of financial theft, impersonation is a key technique. If the initial attempt was blocked, the attackers might try to impersonate someone else or use a different impersonation tactic to achieve their goal.

4. **Conclusion**: Considering the context of a blocked BEC attempt and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step for the attackers would be to continue with their primary tactic of impersonation, possibly trying a different approach or target.

Final Answer: D
