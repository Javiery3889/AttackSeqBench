To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C (Command and Control) servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the actions taken by BlackEnergy after it has established communication with its C&C servers. This implies we are looking for a technique that would logically follow the coordination of malicious activities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for C&C communication, which is how BlackEnergy would coordinate its activities.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.003-Hidden Window**: This suggests methods used to evade detection, such as hiding windows, which could be used after initial communication to maintain stealth.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This implies the use of alternative channels for C&C in case the primary method is disrupted, ensuring continuous communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**: This involves taking control of computational resources, which might not directly follow C&C communication unless the goal is to hijack resources for further malicious activities.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand, which could be a step to hide malicious activities after C&C communication, fitting well with defense evasion tactics.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction**: This involves deleting or modifying data, which could be a goal of the malware but doesn't directly relate to the act of communicating with C&C servers unless as a final step of an attack.
   - **D: T1657-Financial Theft**: This is a specific goal that might not directly follow C&C communication unless the malware's primary purpose is financial theft, and it has reached the stage of executing this goal.

Given the context of communicating with C&C servers and the provided related TTPs, the most logical next step would involve either evading detection to continue malicious activities or taking actions that directly support the malware's objectives. Among the options, **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation** seems the most plausible as a next step after establishing C&C communication, as it would help in maintaining stealth and evading detection, aligning with the defense evasion tactic mentioned in the related TTPs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the context: BlackEnergy communicating with C&C servers.
2. Analyze related TTPs: Focus on Command and Control and Defense Evasion tactics.
3. Evaluate answer choices: Look for techniques that logically follow C&C communication and align with provided TTPs.
4. Select the most appropriate technique: Data Obfuscation supports stealth and evasion after initial communication.

**Final Answer: B**
