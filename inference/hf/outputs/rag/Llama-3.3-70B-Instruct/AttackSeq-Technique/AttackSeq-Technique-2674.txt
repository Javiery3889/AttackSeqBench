To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, after establishing persistence, surveys the victim's computer and encrypts the gathered information before sending it to the command and control server. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs during this process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include techniques related to Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery) and Persistence (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking and T1543.001-Launch Agent). The focus here is on the Discovery tactic, as the question mentions the backdoor surveying the victim's computer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**: This technique involves weakening encryption to make it easier to access encrypted data. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the context is about the backdoor encrypting gathered information before sending it, not weakening existing encryption.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems. The question focuses on the backdoor surveying the local system it has compromised, not discovering remote systems.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and configuration. The question mentions the backdoor surveying the victim's computer, which aligns with discovering system information.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process. While related to persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the action of surveying the system and gathering information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the backdoor surveying the victim's computer, which implies gathering system information.
   - The related TTPs highlight the Discovery tactic, specifically mentioning T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - Given the context of surveying the system and the provided related TTPs, the most appropriate technique is related to discovering system information.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurs as the backdoor surveys the victim's computer is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

Final Answer: C
