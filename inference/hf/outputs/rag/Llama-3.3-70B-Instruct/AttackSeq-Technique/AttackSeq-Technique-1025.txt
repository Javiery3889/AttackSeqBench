To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Gamaredon discovered interesting files for future exfiltration but before their malware scanned all drives and removable media for sensitive files, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary (Gamaredon) has already identified files of interest (e.g., Office documents) on a system that they plan to exfiltrate later. The action of discovering these files suggests that the adversary is in the process of gathering information about the system and its data. The question asks for the technique that likely occurred after this discovery but before the adversary's malware began scanning all drives and removable media for sensitive files.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Techniques under this tactic would involve collecting data from various sources.
   - **Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which could be part of the broader effort to gather sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Techniques under this tactic would help the adversary understand the environment.
   - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is used to discover files and directories on the system, which aligns with the initial step of finding interesting files.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files and other data stored locally. Given that the adversary has already identified interesting files, this technique could be a plausible next step as it involves collecting data from the system, potentially in preparation for exfiltration.
   - **B: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves using specific tools (AutoHotKey and AutoIT) for execution, which doesn't directly relate to the discovery or collection of files for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which could be part of the exfiltration process but seems more related to the method of exfiltration rather than the discovery or initial collection phase.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the system, which could be used for various purposes, including discovery and collection, but is more about the method of interaction rather than the specific action of collecting data for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary has identified interesting files, indicating they are in the collection phase.
   - The next logical step before scanning all drives and removable media would be to collect data from the local system, as this directly relates to gathering information from the system where the interesting files were found.
   - **T1005-Data from Local System** is the most directly related technique to collecting data after discovering interesting files and before a broader scan of all drives and media.

Final Answer: A
