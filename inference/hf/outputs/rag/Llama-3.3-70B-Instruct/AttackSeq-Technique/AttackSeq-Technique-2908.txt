To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS. This implies we are looking for an initial access or early-stage technique that allows attackers to gain remote access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1071.004-DNS". This indicates that the attack involves using DNS for command and control purposes, which is consistent with the use of the RoyalDNS backdoor. However, the question asks about the technique used before this backdoor was deployed, suggesting we need to look at how initial access was gained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This involves using local accounts to gain access. While local accounts can be used for persistence and privilege escalation, they are less likely to be the primary means of initial remote access without prior compromise.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network. This could include exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services or using legitimate services for malicious purposes, which aligns well with gaining initial remote access.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: Using valid accounts for initial access is plausible, especially if credentials were compromised or if an insider threat is involved. However, this is more about the method of authentication rather than the technique of gaining remote access.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This involves using cloud accounts for access, which could be relevant in certain scenarios but might not be directly related to the initial remote access technique in the context provided.

Given the context of gaining remote access before deploying a DNS-based backdoor, the most relevant technique would facilitate the initial breach or access from outside the network. 

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the technique used for remote access before the deployment of a backdoor.
   - The related TTPs highlight command and control via DNS, indicating a need to look at how initial access was achieved to set up such communication.
   - Among the options, **T1133-External Remote Services** stands out as it directly relates to gaining access from outside the network, which is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves using external remote services for initial access.

Final Answer: B
