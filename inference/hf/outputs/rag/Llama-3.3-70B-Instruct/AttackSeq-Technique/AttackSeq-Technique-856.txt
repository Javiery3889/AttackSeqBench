To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after TG-3279 performed network scanning and before the group established persistence for the Conpee plugin framework without modifying the Windows Registry or startup items, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by TG-3279, starting with network scanning. This initial step is associated with the Discovery tactic, aiming to gather information about the target network. The question then mentions the establishment of persistence for the Conpee plugin framework without using the typical methods of modifying the Windows Registry or startup items, which are common techniques for achieving persistence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This is directly related to the initial action of network scanning, which helps in identifying services running on the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry or startup items to maintain persistence, which the question states was not used.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This is a broader category that includes various methods for achieving persistence at boot or logon time, not limited to modifying the Registry or startup items.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to maintain access to a network, which could be a step after initial discovery and before establishing a more permanent form of persistence.
   - **B: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs**: This technique is about clearing logs on Linux or Mac systems, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of establishing persistence on a Windows system.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using a covert channel to communicate with compromised systems, which might not directly fit the sequence of actions leading to persistence.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This involves using cloud accounts for persistence, which doesn't directly relate to the local system persistence methods implied by the question.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence involves using external remote services as a means to interact with the compromised system after initial discovery (network scanning) and before establishing persistence, especially since the typical persistence methods (modifying Registry or startup items) were avoided.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Network scanning (Discovery) is followed by a need to interact with or access the target system.
2. The group avoids typical persistence methods, suggesting they might use alternative, possibly more covert methods.
3. External remote services can provide a means to access and potentially control the system without relying on local persistence mechanisms.

**Final Answer**: A
