To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where PurpleFox, a type of malware, has evaded detection. It used an MSI package to install a rootkit driver and then blocked incoming connections via a firewall rule. The goal now is to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with a specific technique of **T1562.004 - Disable or Modify System Firewall**. This indicates the malware's ability to evade detection by manipulating the system's firewall settings.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with a technique of **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**. This suggests the establishment of a communication channel that allows both the malware and the C&C servers to send and receive data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for command and control. Given that the malware has already evaded detection and is looking to establish a bidirectional communication channel, using a web service could be a plausible method. However, the question specifically mentions blocking incoming connections, which might not directly align with typical web service usage for C&C.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is about using one network protocol as a carrier for another. While it could be used for establishing communication, it's less directly related to the establishment of a bidirectional channel as described.
   - **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves establishing an additional, covert channel for command and control in case the primary channel is discovered. Given the context of evading detection and needing a reliable C&C channel, this could be a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**: While rootkits are mentioned in the initial evasion tactic, this choice doesn't directly address the establishment of a bidirectional communication channel with C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has already evaded detection and manipulated the system's firewall.
   - The primary goal now is to establish a reliable, bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.
   - Considering the need for a covert and reliable channel, especially after evading detection, **T1008-Fallback Channels** seems the most appropriate technique. It aligns with the necessity of having a secure, possibly secondary, means of communication that can bypass typical detection methods, including the blocked incoming connections.

Final Answer: C
