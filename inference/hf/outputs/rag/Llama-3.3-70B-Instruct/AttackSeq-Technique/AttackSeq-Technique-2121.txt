To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious payloads (like SodaMaster) are executed using DESLoader through DLL side-loading. This technique is used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, which helps in evading defenses. The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next to maintain a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This indicates the attacker's initial method of executing malicious code by loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This shows how the attacker evades detection by disguising malicious code within legitimate processes.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**: This technique involves obtaining additional credentials for cloud services, which doesn't directly relate to executing files at regular intervals to maintain a foothold.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute at a specific time or interval, which aligns with the goal of executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes to maintain persistence.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding or disguising files or information, which, while relevant to defense evasion, doesn't directly address the execution of files at intervals.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account**: This technique involves creating a new account, which could be part of establishing persistence but doesn't directly relate to the execution of files at regular intervals.

Given the context of maintaining a foothold and executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes, the most relevant technique is scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals, which directly supports persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already used DLL side-loading for initial execution and defense evasion.
   - To maintain a foothold, the attacker needs to ensure continuous execution of malicious or legitimate files that support their goals.
   - Scheduling tasks or jobs to execute at regular intervals (every 15 minutes in this case) directly supports this goal by ensuring that the attacker's code or desired executables run periodically.

**Final Answer: B**
