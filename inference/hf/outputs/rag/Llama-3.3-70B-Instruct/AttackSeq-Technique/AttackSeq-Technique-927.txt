To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after Volatile Cedar uses keylogging for credential access, it connects with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems. This implies a progression from gaining access (through keylogging) to establishing control over the compromised systems.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This is about collecting data, in this case, credentials, through keylogging.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This involves setting up communication channels between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control (C2) servers, which can be multi-staged for resilience and stealth.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This reiterates the use of keylogging for gaining access to credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario of leveraging keylogged credentials to connect with backend frameworks.
   - **B: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique is about performing system checks, which might be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly connect to the use of multi-tiered server backend frameworks for control.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand, which could be relevant in various stages of an attack but doesn't directly relate to establishing control over systems through multi-tiered backend frameworks.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols, which could be relevant for communication between the compromised system and the C2 servers, especially in the context of multi-tiered server backend frameworks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where keylogging is used for credential access, followed by the establishment of control over targeted systems through connections with multi-tiered server backend frameworks.
   - The related TTPs highlight keylogging for credential access and the use of multi-stage channels for command and control.
   - Given the context, the most relevant technique after gaining access would be one that facilitates communication and control, which aligns with using application layer protocols for command and control purposes.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurs as the campaign connects with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: D
