To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that ensured the Pterodo backdoor remained active across system reboots after Shuckworm's initial actions, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after executing the Pterodo backdoor using malicious documents and scheduling tasks for maintaining a foothold, we need to identify the technique that would keep the backdoor active even after system reboots. This implies we are looking for a persistence technique.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.003-Cron**: This is related to executing system commands and scripts at a specified time or interval, which can be used for various purposes including persistence but is more commonly associated with Linux systems.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This directly relates to scheduling tasks to execute at a specific time or interval, which is a common method for maintaining persistence on a system, especially on Windows platforms.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a system boots up or a user logs on. It directly supports persistence across reboots.
   - **B: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This involves creating or modifying accounts to maintain access, which doesn't directly relate to ensuring a backdoor remains active across reboots.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves using malicious images to hide malicious code, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence across system reboots.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, which can be part of an attack but doesn't directly ensure persistence across reboots.

Given the context of maintaining a backdoor's activity across system reboots and the related TTPs focusing on persistence and execution, the most relevant technique is one that directly supports persistence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question asks for a technique ensuring persistence across reboots.
2. The related TTPs highlight persistence and execution tactics.
3. Among the answer choices, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly addresses persistence by executing code at boot or logon, fitting the requirement of keeping a backdoor active after a system reboot.

**Final Answer**: A
