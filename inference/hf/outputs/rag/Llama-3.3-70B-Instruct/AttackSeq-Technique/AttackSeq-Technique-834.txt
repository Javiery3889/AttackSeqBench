To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the WinDealer malware loading a DLL module into memory. This action is followed by the encryption and staging of stolen information in the %TEMP% directory under the ".a" file extension. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic (Collection) and a technique (T1074.001 - Local Data Staging). This indicates that the attack is focused on collecting data from the compromised system and staging it locally before likely exfiltrating it.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1546.002 - Screensaver**: This technique involves using a screensaver to execute malicious code. While it could be a method for executing malware, it doesn't directly relate to the loading of a DLL or the staging of data.
   - **B: T1564 - Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding artifacts to evade detection. Given that the malware is loading a DLL and staging data, hiding artifacts could be relevant, but it doesn't directly explain the sequence of loading a DLL and then staging encrypted data.
   - **C: T1059.010 - AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves using scripting tools to execute malicious code. While it could be related to loading a DLL, it doesn't directly tie into the staging of encrypted data in the %TEMP% directory.
   - **D: T1129 - Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules (like DLLs) to execute malicious code. Given that the question mentions loading a DLL module into memory, this technique directly relates to the initial action described. The use of shared modules can be a precursor to various malicious activities, including data collection and staging.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the loading of a DLL module, which is directly related to **T1129 - Shared Modules**.
   - The subsequent actions of encrypting and staging stolen information in the %TEMP% directory align with data collection and staging tactics, which could be facilitated by the initial loading of a malicious DLL.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves the use of shared modules (T1129) to facilitate the collection and staging of data, as indicated by the related TTPs focusing on Collection and Local Data Staging.

Final Answer: D
