To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after victims were redirected to compromised websites where scripts or HTML smuggling techniques were employed for malware delivery, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites. These websites use scripts or HTML smuggling techniques to deliver malware. This implies an initial access tactic where the attacker gains access to the victim's system through the internet, typically by exploiting a vulnerability or using social engineering.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by having them visit a website that contains malicious code, which is executed by the user's web browser. This matches the scenario described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves using HTML to hide malicious code, which is then executed by the browser, evading traditional signature-based detection methods. This is directly related to the use of HTML smuggling mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: Although related to drive-by compromises, this technique is more about using compromised systems for further malicious activities, which is not directly implied in the question as the next step after malware delivery.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This involves exfiltrating data to cloud-based storage sites, which does not directly follow the initial access and malware delivery described.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a broader technique that involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information. While related to initial access, it's not the most specific technique that follows the described scenario of malware delivery via compromised websites.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's owners or users, which might be a step after initial access but does not directly relate to the act of delivering malware through compromised websites.
   - **D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves sending targeted emails with malicious links. Although it's a method of initial access, the question specifically mentions redirection to compromised websites and the use of scripts or HTML smuggling for malware delivery, which is more closely related to drive-by compromise than spearphishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario of initial access through compromised websites using scripts or HTML smuggling for malware delivery.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of drive-by compromise and HTML smuggling, which are directly related to the initial access tactic.
   - Among the answer choices, none directly describe the act of delivering malware through a drive-by compromise or HTML smuggling. However, considering the context of initial access and the tactics described, **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (D)** is the closest in terms of being an initial access technique, but it doesn't perfectly match the scenario of being redirected to a compromised website.
   - Given the choices and focusing on the technique that "most likely occurred after victims were redirected," we should consider what typically happens after initial access is gained. Since none of the options perfectly match the immediate next step after drive-by compromise and HTML smuggling, we must consider the broader context of initial access techniques and their immediate consequences.

However, upon closer inspection, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** the described initial access method (drive-by compromise using HTML smuggling), which implies looking for a technique that could logically follow such an event in an attack chain. Given the provided options and understanding that the immediate next steps after initial access might involve establishing a foothold or evading defenses, none of the options directly represent the typical next steps like establishing persistence, executing payloads, or further defense evasion techniques that are more directly related to the post-exploitation phase.

Given the constraints of the question and the provided options, the most fitting answer based on the typical flow of an attack (initial access leading to further malicious activities) and considering the direct implications of the question might not be perfectly represented by any option. However, if we must choose based on the information given and the typical attack flow:

Final Answer: D
