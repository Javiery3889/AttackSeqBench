To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files for initial access. This is followed by the utilization of the double extension trick for defense evasion. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after these initial steps.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension**: This indicates the attackers used a double file extension trick to evade defenses, making it harder for security systems to detect the malicious files.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This shows that the initial access was gained through spearphishing, specifically using links (in this case, malicious '.lnk' files).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. Given that the attackers have already gained initial access and evaded defenses, using an application layer protocol for communication with compromised systems is plausible.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding to hide C2 communications. While possible, the question does not specifically mention encoding techniques.
   - **C: T1010-Application Window Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering application windows, which does not directly relate to facilitating communication with compromised systems.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique mentioned in the question and does not relate to post-compromise communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have gained initial access through spearphishing and used the double extension trick for defense evasion.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence would involve establishing communication with the compromised systems for further actions (e.g., data exfiltration, lateral movement).
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to facilitating communication between the attackers and the compromised systems. This technique allows attackers to use common application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C2 communication, which is a common practice after initial access and defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A**
