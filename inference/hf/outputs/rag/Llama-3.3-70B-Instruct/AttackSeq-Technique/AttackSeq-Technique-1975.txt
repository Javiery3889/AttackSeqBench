To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely involved in targeting specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase, before attackers gained Initial Access via phishing emails. This implies we are looking for a technique related to gathering information about the victims prior to the phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided Related TTPs include:
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

   These TTPs indicate that the attack involves reconnaissance to gather victim information and initial access through phishing techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**: This technique is related to executing malicious code through office template macros, which doesn't directly relate to gathering victim information during reconnaissance.
   - **B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**: This involves scanning for passwords using wordlists, which is not directly related to gathering specific details about victims during the reconnaissance phase for phishing.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique directly involves gathering information about potential victims, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase and is a precursor to targeted attacks like spear phishing.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is related to exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which occurs after initial access has been gained, not during the reconnaissance phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used during the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about potential victims before a phishing attack.
   - The Related TTPs highlight the importance of gathering victim identity information during reconnaissance.
   - Among the answer choices, **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the only technique that directly relates to gathering specific details about potential victims, which is a crucial step before launching targeted phishing attacks.
   - Therefore, this technique is the most plausible choice as it aligns with the reconnaissance phase and the context of preparing for a phishing campaign.

Final Answer: C
