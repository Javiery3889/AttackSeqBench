To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection. It asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services. This implies we are looking for a technique related to gaining initial access through external remote services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1133-External Remote Services". This indicates that the correct answer should be related to how attackers gain initial access to a network by exploiting external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging** is a technique used for defense evasion, not initial access. It involves creating a malicious process in the context of a legitimate process.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts** refers to using default accounts to gain access, which could be part of initial access but doesn't directly relate to compromising external remote services.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading** is a technique related to defense evasion, where code is loaded into a process in a way that makes it hard to detect.
   - **D: T1133-External Remote Services** directly matches the related TTPs provided and the context of the question, which is about compromising external remote services during the initial access phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the initial access phase and compromising external remote services.
   - The related TTPs highlight "Initial Access" and "T1133-External Remote Services", indicating that the correct technique should be directly related to these.
   - Among the answer choices, **D: T1133-External Remote Services** is the only one that directly aligns with both the question's context and the provided related TTPs.

Final Answer: D
