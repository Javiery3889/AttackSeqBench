To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a JavaScript file creates an executable ('d3reEW.exe') that uses the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information. This action is followed by the need to enable HTTPS communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate this HTTPS communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic of "Discovery" and a technique of "T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery". This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system, which aligns with the use of 'ipconfig' to discover IP address information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. Given that HTTPS is an application layer protocol, this technique could be relevant for enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling tasks or jobs to execute at a specific time or interval. While it could be used in the broader context of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This sub-technique involves using an internal proxy to direct traffic. It could potentially be used to manage communication with a C&C server but is more about redirecting traffic than establishing the communication protocol itself.
   - **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This is a sub-technique of System Network Configuration Discovery and specifically focuses on discovering internet connectivity. While related to network discovery, it doesn't directly pertain to establishing HTTPS communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action of discovering IP address information using 'ipconfig' aligns with system network configuration discovery (T1016).
   - The question specifically asks about enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server, which implies the use of a specific application layer protocol for secure communication.
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to using a specific protocol (in this case, HTTPS) for communication with a C&C server.

Final Answer: A
