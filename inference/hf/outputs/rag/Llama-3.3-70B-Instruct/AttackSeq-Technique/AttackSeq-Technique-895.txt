To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has ensured the integrity of a malicious payload and bypassed detection using an encrypted shellcode. The goal is to load a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) and execute the decrypted payload. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to achieve this.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process, often by taking advantage of the way Windows loads DLLs, to evade detection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about making encoded or encrypted data readable and usable, which aligns with the decryption of the payload mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying a container to execute malicious code. While containers can be used for evasion, the question specifically mentions loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload, which doesn't directly relate to container deployment.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be relevant for loading a DLL and executing code. Native APIs can be used to perform various system operations, including those that might be necessary for loading and executing a malicious payload.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique is about using encryption to protect communication between the adversary and the compromised system. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the focus is on loading a DLL and executing the payload, not establishing an encrypted channel.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or disguising artifacts of an intrusion. While hiding artifacts is a part of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about loading a DLL and executing a payload, which is more directly related to executing code rather than hiding evidence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the execution of a decrypted payload by loading a DLL, which suggests the use of system APIs to achieve this.
   - T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is directly related to loading malicious DLLs, which aligns with the question's context.
   - However, the question asks for the technique that "most likely occurred to load a DLL and execute the decrypted payload," which implies the action of executing or running the payload after it has been decrypted and loaded.
   - Given the provided options and the context of executing a decrypted payload by loading a DLL, **T1106-Native API** is the most relevant technique. This is because using native APIs can be a part of the process to load and execute a DLL, especially in the context of defense evasion and executing malicious code.

**Final Answer: B**
