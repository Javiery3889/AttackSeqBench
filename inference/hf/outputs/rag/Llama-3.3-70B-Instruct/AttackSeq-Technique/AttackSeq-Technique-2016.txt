To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Welcome Chat app exfiltrated sensitive data from the victim device, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an app, Welcome Chat, has already exfiltrated a significant amount of sensitive data from a victim's device. This includes SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are categorized under specific tactics and techniques:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial action of the Welcome Chat app exfiltrating various types of data.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could be a method used after the data collection.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This involves collecting data from messaging applications, which is relevant to the Welcome Chat app's ability to exfiltrate SMS messages and possibly other messaging data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's location, which could be related to the GPS data exfiltration but doesn't directly follow the exfiltration of the mentioned data types as a necessary next step.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: Subverting trust controls involves manipulating the trust mechanisms of a system, which doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data as described.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication, which could be relevant for exfiltrating data over the network but is more about the method of communication rather than a direct consequence of the data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: Protocol tunneling involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol for communication, which could be a method used to exfiltrate data without being detected, especially after the initial data collection.

Given the context that the data has already been exfiltrated, the next logical step would involve either further communication with the C2 server or ensuring the exfiltrated data is transmitted securely and stealthily. Among the options provided, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems the most relevant as it directly pertains to the use of protocols for communication, which would be necessary for exfiltrating the collected data over the network to the attackers' servers. This technique aligns with the need to transmit the exfiltrated data, making it a plausible next step after the data collection.

**Final Answer: C**
