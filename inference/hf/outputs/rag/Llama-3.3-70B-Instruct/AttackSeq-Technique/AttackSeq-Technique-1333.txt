To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained command and control, possibly through HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites. Following this, the attacker attempts to move between systems using a "net use" command after receiving positive ping responses. The "net use" command is typically used to map a network drive or connect to a shared resource on a network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This involves the adversary discovering systems on the network that can be used for further exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle**: This technique involves the adversary positioning themselves between two communication points to intercept or alter data.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This involves the adversary moving tools and payloads across a network to expand their access and control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of a "net use" command after positive ping responses suggests the attacker is attempting to access or map network drives, which is a form of interacting with remote systems.
   - **T1563.001-SSH Hijacking (A)**: This involves taking control of an existing SSH session, which doesn't directly relate to the use of "net use" commands or the described scenario of moving between systems based on ping responses.
   - **T1021-Remote Services (B)**: This technique involves using remote services to interact with a system, which could include using network shares or other remote access services. The "net use" command fits within the context of interacting with remote services.
   - **T1106-Native API (C)**: This involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is more about the method of interacting with a system rather than moving between systems.
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System (D)**: This technique is about hiding files or data within a file system, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario of moving between systems using "net use" commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes an attacker attempting to access or map network drives after gaining command and control, which aligns with interacting with remote systems.
   - The "net use" command is specifically used for mapping network drives or connecting to shared resources, which fits the description of using remote services to move between systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is related to using remote services for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
