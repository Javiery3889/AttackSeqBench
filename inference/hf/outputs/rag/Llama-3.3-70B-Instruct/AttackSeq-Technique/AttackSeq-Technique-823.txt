To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FIN4 captures user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros. This indicates an initial access attempt where the attackers are trying to gain access to the target system or network by tricking users into executing malicious code embedded in email attachments.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to initial access and lateral movement tactics. Specifically, they mention:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This involves spearphishing targeted at users within the organization to move laterally within the network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This involves using links in spearphishing emails to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves using attachments in spearphishing emails to gain initial access, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token**: This technique involves stealing access tokens to gain access to systems or services without using credentials directly. While related to credential theft, it doesn't directly match the method described (spearphishing with VBA macros).
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could include keystrokes or other forms of input. It's more related to keylogging or similar activities rather than the direct capture of credentials through spearphishing.
   - **C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This involves setting up email forwarding rules to intercept or exfiltrate sensitive information. It doesn't directly relate to the initial capture of credentials through spearphishing.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique is about removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection, not directly related to the initial capture of credentials.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique to the scenario described (capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros) is not explicitly listed among the choices provided in a manner that perfectly matches the description. However, the closest in terms of initial access and the method of using spearphishing (though not directly mentioning VBA macros) would be related to the initial access techniques.

Since none of the provided answer choices directly describe the action of capturing credentials through spearphishing with VBA macros, and based on the closest relation to the initial access tactic and spearphishing technique, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the provided choices to the scenario. The scenario described aligns with initial access techniques, particularly those involving spearphishing, but the exact match from the provided choices isn't straightforward.

However, considering the closest alignment with the tactics and techniques provided and the nature of the question, the answer should relate to the initial access method described. Given the direct mention of spearphishing and the context of initial access, but acknowledging the specific techniques listed don't perfectly match the scenario of capturing credentials via VBA macros in emails, the evaluation process highlights a challenge in directly mapping the provided choices to the scenario without an exact match.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: Given the information and the process of elimination, none of the choices directly address the capture of credentials via spearphishing with VBA macros as described. The closest in context would be techniques related to initial access via spearphishing, but the specific action of capturing credentials through this method (especially with VBA macros) isn't directly listed among the choices provided.

Given the constraints and focusing on the initial access method:
Final Answer: B
