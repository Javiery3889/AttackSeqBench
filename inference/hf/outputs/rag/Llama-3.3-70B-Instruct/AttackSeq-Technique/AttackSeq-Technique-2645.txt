To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used to transmit files to the command and control (C&C) servers after staging and encrypting the data, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where data has been collected, staged in a temporary folder, and encrypted. The next step in the attack sequence involves transmitting these files to the C&C servers. This implies we are looking for a technique related to data exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all under the "Collection" tactic, which involves gathering information from the target. The techniques mentioned include:
   - **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: Staging data locally on the system before exfiltration.
   - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: Staging data remotely, possibly on a compromised system or a cloud service, before exfiltration.
   - **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: Compressing or encrypting data to make it easier to exfiltrate.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which does not directly relate to exfiltrating data to C&C servers.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel that is symmetrically encrypted. While encryption is mentioned, the focus on non-C2 protocol might not directly align with transmitting to C&C servers.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario of transmitting encrypted files to C&C servers.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities or open ports, which is unrelated to the exfiltration of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions transmitting files to C&C servers after they have been staged and encrypted.
   - The related TTPs indicate a focus on collecting and staging data, with an emphasis on preparing it for exfiltration (e.g., through encryption).
   - Among the answer choices, **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the technique that directly involves transmitting data to C&C servers, which is the next logical step after staging and encrypting the data.
   
Final Answer: C
