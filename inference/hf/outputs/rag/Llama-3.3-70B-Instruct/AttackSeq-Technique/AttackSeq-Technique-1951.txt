To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used to maintain the malware's presence on the system after leveraging DLL side-loading for the execution of the PlugX RAT, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the technique used for maintaining the presence of malware (PlugX RAT) on a system after it has been executed using DLL side-loading. DLL side-loading is a technique used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, which is related to both persistence and defense evasion tactics.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This indicates that DLL side-loading is used for persistence, meaning the malware is trying to stay on the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This shows that DLL side-loading is also used for defense evasion, helping the malware avoid detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**: This technique involves modifying the home page of Outlook to possibly load malicious content. While it could be used for persistence, it's less directly related to maintaining the presence of a RAT like PlugX.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials, which is more related to credential access than to maintaining malware presence.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malware automatically at boot or logon, which directly supports persistence by ensuring the malware restarts after a system reboot or user logon.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, which is more related to initial access than to maintaining persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that the question asks about maintaining the malware's presence after it has been executed, we are looking for a technique that ensures the malware remains active on the system over time.
   - DLL side-loading (T1574.002) is used for both persistence and defense evasion, indicating the malware is already employing a method to stay hidden and active.
   - Among the provided options, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most directly related to ensuring the malware persists on the system by automatically restarting it after a reboot or logon.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for maintaining the presence of the PlugX RAT on the system after DLL side-loading would involve ensuring the malware can autostart.

Final Answer: C
