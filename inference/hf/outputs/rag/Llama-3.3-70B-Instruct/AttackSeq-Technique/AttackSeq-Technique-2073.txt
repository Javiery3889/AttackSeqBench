To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after executing the loader Trojan.Vcrodat using search order hijacking and before Whitefly utilized Mimikatz to escalate privileges, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of events involving the execution of a loader Trojan.Vcrodat, which utilizes search order hijacking (T1574.001), and later, the use of Mimikatz for privilege escalation. We need to find the technique that fits between these two events in the attack sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) under the tactics of Privilege Escalation and Persistence. This technique involves an adversary hijacking the search order used by the operating system to load DLLs, allowing them to load malicious DLLs instead of legitimate ones. This is relevant to the initial part of the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. While it's related to privilege escalation, it doesn't directly connect to the use of Mimikatz or the specific context of search order hijacking as a precursor.
   - **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves hollowing out a legitimate process and replacing its contents with malicious code. Given that the loader Trojan.Vcrodat is involved, which likely requires executing malicious code within a legitimate process context to avoid detection, this seems like a plausible step after the initial hijacking and before attempting to escalate privileges with Mimikatz.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about discovering services on the network. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly fit between the execution of a loader using search order hijacking and the escalation of privileges.
   - **D: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**: This involves modifying SSH authorized keys to maintain access. It's more related to persistence and doesn't directly connect to the sequence of executing a loader and then escalating privileges using Mimikatz.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a sequence starting with the execution of a loader Trojan using search order hijacking.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the context, would involve executing malicious code within a legitimate process to maintain stealth and prepare for further actions like privilege escalation.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** fits this requirement as it involves executing malicious code within a legitimate process, which aligns with the need to execute the loader Trojan.Vcrodat in a way that evades detection and sets the stage for privilege escalation using Mimikatz.

Final Answer: B
