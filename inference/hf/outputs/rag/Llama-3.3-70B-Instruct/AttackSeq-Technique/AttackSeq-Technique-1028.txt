To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Gamaredon exfiltrated collected data to their C&C server, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions scanning all drives, including network shares and removable drives, for sensitive documents. This action is part of the collection phase, where an adversary gathers information. The question specifically asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration of the collected data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This involves collecting data from network shared drives, which aligns with the scanning of network shares mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include scanning local drives for sensitive documents.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which doesn't directly relate to scanning drives for sensitive documents.
   - **B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This involves collecting emails from local email clients, which is not directly related to scanning drives for documents.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be used to scan drives and collect data without being detected. It's a plausible precursor to exfiltration as it could be used to gather the data that is then exfiltrated.
   - **D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order to intercept and potentially modify commands, which is not directly related to the action of scanning drives for sensitive documents.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of scanning drives for sensitive documents and the provided related TTPs, the most relevant techniques are those that involve data collection from local systems and network shares.
   - The use of **T1106-Native API** could be a method to achieve the scanning and collection of sensitive documents without being detected, making it a plausible step before exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before Gamaredon exfiltrated the collected data to their C&C server is related to using native system capabilities to collect the data.

Final Answer: C
