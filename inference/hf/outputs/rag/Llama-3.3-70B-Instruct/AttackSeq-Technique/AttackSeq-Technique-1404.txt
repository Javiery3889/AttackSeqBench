To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The attack starts with exploiting CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails for initial access. This indicates the use of social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious emails or links, which then exploit a vulnerability.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers achieve persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key. This suggests that the attackers modified the registry to ensure their malware or backdoor remains active even after system reboots.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after these initial steps.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Initial Access" with techniques including "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link". These are relevant to how the initial access was gained but do not directly address the communication aspect with the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application-layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for command and control (C2) communications. Given that the attackers have already gained access and achieved persistence, using an application layer protocol is a common method for communicating with the attacker's infrastructure without arousing suspicion.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique is more related to escalating privileges within a system rather than communicating with external infrastructure.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: While phishing was used for initial access, it's not directly related to communicating with the attacker's infrastructure after access has been gained.
   - **D: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This involves using an internal proxy for C2 communications, which could be a method but is more specific and less commonly the immediate next step compared to using standard application layer protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have gained initial access through spear phishing and achieved persistence.
   - The next logical step for the attackers would be to establish a method for communicating with their command and control infrastructure.
   - Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most straightforward and common technique for this purpose, as it allows for covert communication over standard protocols that are less likely to be blocked by network defenses.

Final Answer: A
