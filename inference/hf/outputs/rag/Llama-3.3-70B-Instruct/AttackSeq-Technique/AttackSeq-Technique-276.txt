To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Bandook campaign uses URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker. After this initial redirection, the attacker executes PowerShell scripts to drop additional files. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs before executing these PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.005-Link Target**: This involves using links to direct users to specific resources or locations, which can be part of the initial access or reconnaissance phase.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts, which is directly mentioned in the question as part of the attack sequence.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing with a link to gain initial access to a system. The use of URL shortening services to redirect to an attacker-controlled domain fits within this context.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the attack sequence starts with leveraging URL shortening services (which aligns with **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** for initial access), we need to find a technique that logically precedes the execution of PowerShell scripts (**T1059.001-PowerShell**).
   - **T1608.005-Link Target** is related to the initial phase of directing users to specific resources and could be part of how the attack begins, but it doesn't directly describe the action taken after initial access and before executing PowerShell scripts.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** (option B) would be relevant if the question mentioned establishing a secure channel for command and control (C2) communications, which is not directly implied before the execution of PowerShell scripts in this context.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services** (option C) could be relevant as it involves using external services for C2 communications or to host malicious tools, which could fit the scenario of using URL shortening services and then executing scripts. However, this doesn't directly address the action immediately before executing PowerShell scripts.
   - **T1659-Content Injection** (option A) doesn't directly fit the scenario described as it involves injecting malicious content into a website, which isn't the focus of the question.
   - **T1584.005-Botnet** (option D) is about using a botnet for C2 communications, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an initial access technique involving URL shortening services, followed by the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - The most relevant technique that would occur after initial access (via spearphishing link or similar) and before executing PowerShell scripts would involve setting up or utilizing a means to execute these scripts, potentially involving external services or establishing a channel for C2.
   - Given the options and the context provided, **T1133-External Remote Services** seems the most plausible as it could involve using external services (like those used for URL shortening and subsequent C2) before executing scripts like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

Final Answer: C
