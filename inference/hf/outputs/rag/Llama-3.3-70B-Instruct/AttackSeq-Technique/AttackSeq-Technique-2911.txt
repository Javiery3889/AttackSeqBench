To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe, we need to analyze the given information and the related TTPs.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT15 evades policy settings by modifying cmd.exe to facilitate the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor. This action suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain access and execute commands on the compromised system without being detected.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging**: This technique involves disabling logging to hide malicious activity, which aligns with evading detection.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands, which could be relevant after modifying cmd.exe.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: Modifying the registry can be used to achieve persistence or disable security features.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**: This technique involves modifying kernel callback tables, which is a sophisticated method of persistence and evasion but doesn't directly relate to the immediate actions described after evading policy settings.
   - **B: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique is about impairing system defenses, which aligns with the action of evading policy settings and could include actions like disabling Windows event logging (T1562.002) to prevent detection of further malicious activities.
   - **C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**: This involves using reversible encryption to protect data, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario of evading policy settings to install a backdoor.
   - **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique is about stealing or forging certificates for authentication, which doesn't directly follow from the action of modifying cmd.exe to evade policy settings.

Given the context of evading policy settings to install a backdoor and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step would involve further impairing system defenses to maintain access and execute commands without detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. APT15's action of copying and patching cmd.exe is a form of defense evasion.
2. The goal is to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor, suggesting a need to maintain access and evade detection.
3. Among the provided options, impairing defenses (B: T1562-Impair Defenses) is the most direct follow-up action to evade policy settings, as it encompasses a broader range of techniques (including disabling Windows event logging) that would help in maintaining stealth and ensuring the backdoor's persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
