To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access via spear-phishing emails with exploit documents and before employing encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack started with spear-phishing emails containing exploit documents, which aligns with **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**. This technique is used for initial access, where attackers send malicious attachments to gain access to a system.

2. **Given Context**: After gaining initial access, the attackers need to perform actions that would lead to downloading additional malware while evading detection. The use of "encoded blobs to bypass detection" suggests a method to evade security controls, which is part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

3. **Related TTPs Analysis**:
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling** is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic, which involves smuggling malicious payloads through HTML files. While this could be a method for evading detection, it doesn't directly relate to the action of downloading additional malware after initial access.
   - **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** is another initial access technique and doesn't fit the sequence of actions after initial access has been gained.
   - The question hints at a sequence where after initial access (via spear-phishing), the attackers aim to download additional malware while evading detection.

4. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This involves using Lua for command and scripting interpreter, which could be a method for executing scripts, but it's not directly implied by the context of downloading additional malware after initial access.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves utilizing existing command and scripting interpreters to execute malicious commands. Given the context of needing to download additional malware after initial access and before employing evasion techniques, using a command and scripting interpreter could be a plausible step for executing scripts that download malware.
   - **C: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves using local accounts for persistence, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of downloading additional malware.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which could be part of post-exploitation but doesn't directly relate to the action of downloading additional malware after initial access.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the sequence of actions described (initial access via spear-phishing, followed by an action that leads to downloading additional malware, and then employing evasion techniques), **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** seems the most plausible. This technique could be used to execute scripts that download additional malware, fitting the sequence before more evasion techniques are employed.

Final Answer: B
