To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the RYUK ransomware was deployed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions Command-and-Control (C2) communications with a specific IP address and a URL. This indicates that there was some form of communication between the attackers and their infrastructure before the deployment of the RYUK ransomware. The mention of C2 communications suggests that the attackers needed to establish a channel to control the compromised system or to receive commands.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1571-Non-Standard Port". This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communications, which can help evade detection by traditional security monitoring tools that typically focus on standard ports.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Given the context of C2 communications and the specific mention of a non-standard port (443 is standard for HTTPS, but the context might imply its non-standard use or the IP address itself being non-standard for common services), this technique aligns closely with the scenario described. The use of a specific IP address and a HTTPS URL could imply that non-standard ports or protocols are being utilized for C2, fitting the description of T1571.
   - **B: T1593.003-Code Repositories**: This involves using code repositories as a means for C2. While possible, the information provided does not directly suggest the use of code repositories for C2 communications.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols. The question, however, focuses on the deployment of ransomware following C2 communications, not specifically on data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**: Similar to C, this involves exfiltrating data, but the scenario described is more about the communication leading to ransomware deployment rather than data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question hints at C2 communications before the deployment of ransomware.
   - The related TTPs emphasize Command and Control and the use of non-standard ports.
   - The most relevant technique to C2 communications, especially when considering the specifics of the question (IP address and URL), is the use of non-standard ports for such communications.
   
Final Answer: A
