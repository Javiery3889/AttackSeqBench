To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via a malicious Excel document. This is followed by an attempt to evade detection and then credential access techniques. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely involved evading detection by concealing malicious activities after the initial exploitation but before attempting to access credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** under the Execution tactic, which aligns with the initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories** and **T1036-Masquerading** under the Defense Evasion tactic, which are related to evading detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1110.003-Password Spraying** is a technique used for credential access, not for evading detection after exploitation.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is related to command and control (C2) and does not directly relate to evading detection by concealing malicious activities after exploitation.
   - **C: T1564.005-Hidden File System** is a specific technique under the broader category of hiding artifacts, which could be relevant but is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs provided.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts** is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic that involves concealing malicious artifacts, which aligns with the goal of evading detection after exploitation and before attempting credential access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial exploitation is achieved through **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.
   - The question asks for the technique most likely involved in evading detection after this exploitation but before credential access techniques.
   - Among the provided options, **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts** is the most relevant to evading detection by concealing malicious activities. This technique directly supports the evasion of detection, which is necessary after the initial exploitation and before attempting to access credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves using **T1564-Hide Artifacts** to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
