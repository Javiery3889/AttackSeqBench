To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Sidewinder utilized an HTA (HTML Application) file to communicate with the C2 (Command and Control) server regarding installed antivirus software, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The use of an HTA file to communicate with a C2 server about installed antivirus software suggests that the adversary is gathering information about the security posture of the compromised system. This action is typically part of the discovery phase, where attackers seek to understand the environment they are operating in.

2. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization. Techniques under this tactic help in understanding the environment.
   - **Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This is a specific technique under the Discovery tactic where the adversary attempts to identify and gather information about security software that could detect their presence. This directly relates to the scenario described, where the HTA file is used to report on installed antivirus software.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used by the adversary to evade detection. While relevant, the specific technique mentioned (T1218.005-Mshta) is more about how the HTA file is used for defense evasion rather than what happens after the communication regarding antivirus software.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems. While it's a discovery technique, it doesn't directly follow the context of discovering security software on the local system.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about achieving persistence, which is a different tactic (Persistence) and doesn't directly relate to the discovery of security software.
   - **C: T1592.001-Hardware**: This involves gathering information about hardware components, which is not directly related to the discovery of installed antivirus software.
   - **D: T1518-Software Discovery**: This is the broader technique under which T1518.001-Security Software Discovery falls. Given that the adversary has already used an HTA file to communicate about antivirus software, further software discovery could logically follow as they continue to gather information about the system's security posture and other installed software.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided context and related TTPs, the most plausible next step after discovering and reporting on antivirus software would be to continue with software discovery to gather more comprehensive information about the system.

Final Answer: D
