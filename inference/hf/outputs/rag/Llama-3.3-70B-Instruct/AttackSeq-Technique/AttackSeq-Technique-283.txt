To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Before Dropping Elephant, uses spear-phishing with MS Word documents that exploit CVE vulnerabilities to gain access. It asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred after gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks targeting high-profile entities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic, which involves techniques used by attackers to gain initial access to a network. The techniques mentioned include:
   - T1189: Drive-by Compromise
   - T1566.002: Spearphishing Link
   - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment

   These techniques are about exploiting vulnerabilities or tricking users into opening malicious links or attachments to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship between the attacker and the target. While it could be a part of the broader campaign, it doesn't directly follow from the described actions of spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding or disguising files or information to avoid detection. Given that the attackers are using MS Word documents with exploits, it's plausible they would also use obfuscation to hide their malicious code or activities from detection after initial access.
   - **C: T1593.003-Code Repositories**: This involves using code repositories as a means to store or distribute malicious code. While it could be part of a broader campaign, it doesn't directly follow the described initial access methods.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the general technique of phishing, which includes spear-phishing. The question already states that spear-phishing was used for initial access, so this doesn't describe a subsequent action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers used spear-phishing with MS Word documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this initial access, focusing on the context of gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Given the context of exploiting vulnerabilities and using spear-phishing, the attackers would likely want to maintain access and avoid detection.
   - **Obfuscating files or information (T1027)** would be a logical next step to hide their malicious activities and code from detection after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: B
