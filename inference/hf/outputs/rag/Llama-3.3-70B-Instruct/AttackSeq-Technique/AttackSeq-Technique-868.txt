To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after GreyEnergy's operators used spearphishing and the compromise of servers as infection vectors, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before they attempted lateral movement to other workstations within the targeted organization's network. This implies we are looking for a technique that would logically precede or facilitate lateral movement.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are all categorized under the tactic of Lateral Movement and include techniques such as Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210), Internal Spearphishing (T1534), and Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570). These techniques are directly related to moving laterally within a network but do not necessarily indicate what happens immediately before lateral movement attempts.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access. Given that the question mentions the use of spearphishing and server compromise as infection vectors, this technique might not directly precede lateral movement in this context.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding or disguising artifacts to evade detection. While hiding artifacts could be a step taken after initial compromise to maintain access and before lateral movement, it's not directly related to the preparation for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the browser and its configuration, which could be useful for understanding the environment before attempting lateral movement, especially if the attackers are looking to exploit specific browser vulnerabilities or understand the network's segmentation.
   - **D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a supplier or vendor to gain access to the target organization. Given that the question already establishes the initial infection vectors (spearphishing and server compromise), this does not seem directly relevant to the actions taken after initial access and before lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before attempting lateral movement.
   - Lateral movement techniques (like T1210, T1534, T1570) are about the action of moving within the network.
   - Among the given choices, **T1217-Browser Information Discovery** seems most relevant as a precursor to lateral movement because understanding the browser and its environment could provide valuable information for planning the lateral movement, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities or understanding the network layout.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves gathering information about the environment (in this case, browser information) before attempting to move laterally.

Final Answer: C
