To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before APT42 gained initial access. This technique should complement their credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors, in the context of spear phishing and bypassing MFA.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on Initial Access and Reconnaissance tactics, specifically involving phishing and spear phishing techniques. This context suggests that the answer should be related to how attackers prepare for or execute their initial access attempts, potentially involving social engineering or the development of capabilities to bypass security measures like MFA.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**: This technique involves installing a root certificate on a compromised system, which could be used to intercept encrypted communications. While it's a method that could support credential harvesting, it's more about post-exploitation and persistence rather than directly complementing initial access efforts with spear phishing.
   - **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities, such as tools or malware, that can be used in an operation. Given the context of using lightweight tools and custom backdoors to complement credential harvesting efforts, this seems highly relevant. Developing capabilities would be a precursor to using them in spear phishing campaigns or bypassing MFA.
   - **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**: This technique involves using social media accounts for social engineering. While social engineering is relevant to spear phishing, the specific use of social media accounts doesn't directly relate to complementing credential harvesting with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves spear phishing that is targeted internally within an organization. While it's a form of spear phishing, the question seems to be asking about activities that precede or support the initial access attempt, rather than the method of spear phishing itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for an ATT&CK technique that complements credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors before gaining initial access via spear phishing and bypassing MFA.
   - The related TTPs focus on Initial Access and Reconnaissance, indicating the answer should relate to preparation or execution of initial access attempts.
   - Among the options, **T1587-Develop Capabilities** is the most relevant because it involves developing tools or capabilities that could be used for credential harvesting and bypassing security measures, aligning with the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors in the context of spear phishing.

Final Answer: B
