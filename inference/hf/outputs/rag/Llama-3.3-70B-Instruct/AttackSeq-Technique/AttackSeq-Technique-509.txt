To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has archived collected data in a custom storage file format. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer the data from the victim's system after this archiving process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the tactics of Collection and Exfiltration. Specifically, they include:
   - **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial steps of gathering information but does not directly address the transfer of data.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which directly relates to transferring data from the victim's system to the attackers.
   - **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which is mentioned in the question as the SombRAT backdoor archiving collected data in a custom storage file format.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**: This involves transferring data using a USB drive, which is not indicated in the scenario provided.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique is about using shared modules, which does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This involves modifying domain properties, which is not relevant to the described data transfer scenario.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: Given that the data has been archived and the context of transferring this data, exfiltration over a C2 channel is the most logical next step for transferring the archived data from the victim's system to the attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that data has been archived in a custom format, indicating a collection tactic has been completed.
   - The focus is on the exfiltration of this archived data.
   - Among the provided options, **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the technique that directly addresses the transfer of data from the victim's system after it has been collected and archived.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves exfiltrating the data over a C2 channel after it has been archived.

Final Answer: D
