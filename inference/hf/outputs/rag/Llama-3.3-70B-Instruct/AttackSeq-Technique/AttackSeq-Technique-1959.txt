To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a threat actor uses stolen credentials to gain VPN access and eventually achieves persistence by configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this persistence was achieved.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to persistence and initial access tactics. Specifically, they mention:
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access, which aligns with the use of stolen credentials mentioned in the question.
   - **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique can be used for both initial access and persistence, involving the use of external services to access a network.
   - The tactics mentioned are Persistence and Initial Access, indicating the threat actor's goals of maintaining access and initially gaining access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising as a legitimate process or service. While it could be used in various stages of an attack, it's not directly implied by the use of stolen credentials or the configuration of malware for WMI persistence.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique is about scanning IP blocks to gather information, which doesn't directly relate to the actions described (using stolen credentials and configuring malware for persistence).
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**: Given that the threat actor used stolen credentials to access the network via VPN (an external remote service), this technique is relevant. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before achieving persistence with TrailBlazer malware.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This is directly related to the initial action described in the question, where stolen credentials (valid accounts) were used to gain access. The use of valid accounts would precede the configuration of malware for persistence, as the actor would first need access before they could configure the system for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of stolen credentials to persist via VPN access and then achieve persistence with TrailBlazer malware.
   - The most direct precursor to configuring malware for persistence, given the context of using stolen credentials, is the use of those valid accounts to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before achieving persistence is the use of valid accounts to gain access to the system, which aligns with **T1078-Valid Accounts**.

Final Answer: D
