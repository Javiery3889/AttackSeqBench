To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Lazarus Group collected user and account information, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus Group using "net user" and system utilities to collect user and account information as part of their discovery process. This indicates they are trying to discover accounts and possibly other system details on a compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are under the "Discovery" tactic, which aligns with the context of the question. Specifically, T1087.001 (Local Account) and T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) are techniques used to gather information about the system and its users.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to gather information about accounts on a system. Given that the Lazarus Group used "net user" and system utilities for account information collection, this seems closely related but might not necessarily precede the action described.
   - **B: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This involves discovering resources and services within cloud environments, which doesn't directly relate to the use of "net user" and system utilities for account information on what appears to be an on-premise system or endpoint.
   - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique is about modifying account settings, which would likely occur after account discovery, not before.
   - **D: T1055.015-ListPlanting**: This is a sub-technique of T1055 (Process Discovery) and involves creating lists of running processes. While it's a discovery technique, it's more focused on processes rather than account information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the collection of user and account information.
   - The use of "net user" and system utilities suggests a focus on local system and account discovery.
   - T1087-Account Discovery (and its sub-technique T1087.001-Local Account) directly relates to gathering account information, which aligns with the described actions.
   - However, considering the question asks for the technique that "most likely occurred before" the collection of user and account information, we need to think about what would typically precede account discovery in an attack sequence. 
   - Discovering the system owner or user (T1033) could be an initial step that provides context for further account discovery, but it's closely related to account discovery itself.
   - Given the context, the most logical precursor in the provided options that aligns with the discovery process and precedes detailed account discovery would be discovering the system and its basic user information.

**Final Answer: A**
