To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable access to vulnerable systems before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on those systems. This implies we are looking for an initial access technique that allows the botnet to gain access to the systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This suggests the exploitation of services accessible over the network to move laterally within an environment.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This indicates the use of a Unix shell to execute commands on a system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: Similar to the Unix shell, this involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands on a Windows system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access. Given that the Tuyul botnet needs to access vulnerable systems, exploiting a public-facing application could be a plausible initial step.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to initially access a network. While it could be relevant, the question hints at a more direct exploitation method to enable command execution.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This is more related to the execution of code within a process, which doesn't directly relate to the initial access method.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique is about executing commands on a system, which is what the botnet does after gaining access, not how it gains access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that enables access to vulnerable systems before command execution.
   - The related TTPs suggest exploitation and execution techniques, but the initial access technique is what's being queried.
   - Exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) is a common method for gaining initial access to a network or system, which would then allow the botnet to execute commands using techniques like T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) with specific sub-techniques for Unix or Windows shells.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence starts with exploiting a vulnerability to gain access.

Final Answer: A
