To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial actions of keylogging and RAM scraping by FastPOS, let's analyze the question and the provided Related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines an attack sequence where FastPOS, a type of malware, has already employed keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information. Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes (often to obtain passwords or other sensitive information), and RAM scraping involves searching the memory of a system for sensitive data, such as credit card numbers. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely followed under the Collection tactic before the stolen credit card information was transmitted to the attacker.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided Related TTPs include:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging. This is a specific type of input capture where keystrokes are recorded.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System. This involves collecting data from the local system, which could include files, folders, or other data stored locally.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to get a list of running processes on the system. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to collecting or handling the stolen credit card information after keylogging and RAM scraping.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This involves capturing the clipboard contents. Although it's a form of data collection, it's less directly related to the immediate actions following keylogging and RAM scraping aimed at stealing credit card information.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores. While relevant to collecting sensitive information, it's more focused on credentials rather than the immediate handling of stolen credit card data.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This is the broader category under which keylogging falls (as indicated by T1056.001-Keylogging in the Related TTPs). Given that keylogging has already been employed, and considering the context of collecting credit card information, this option seems to align closely with the actions described. However, since keylogging is a form of input capture, and the question seems to ask for a subsequent action, we need to consider if there's an implication of further data collection or handling before transmission.

Given the context and the techniques provided, **T1056-Input Capture** seems closely related to the actions already taken (keylogging), and the question might imply looking for a technique that aligns with the collection of data (like credit card numbers) immediately before transmission. However, considering the specific actions of keylogging and RAM scraping have already occurred, and looking for a technique that fits the sequence before transmission, **T1005-Data from Local System** could be considered if we interpret the question as looking for how the stolen data (now stored locally in some form) is handled or collected before being sent out. But, since the question specifically mentions keylogging and RAM scraping, and then asks for a technique under the Collection tactic before transmission, it suggests looking for a technique closely related to these initial actions.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial actions: Keylogging and RAM scraping for stealing information.
2. Consider the Collection tactic: The focus is on collecting data.
3. Evaluate the options: Given the context, the most relevant technique should directly relate to handling or collecting sensitive data like credit card numbers after keylogging and RAM scraping.

**Final Answer**: Given the context and focusing on the Collection tactic after keylogging and RAM scraping have occurred, the most appropriate choice seems to be **D: T1056-Input Capture**, as it directly relates to the collection of sensitive information through methods like keylogging, which has already been employed. However, considering the need to select the best option based on the sequence and the provided Related TTPs, and acknowledging the specific mention of keylogging (a form of input capture) and the broader context of collecting data before transmission, the reasoning process suggests aligning with techniques under the Collection tactic that directly follow such actions. 

**Final Answer: D**
