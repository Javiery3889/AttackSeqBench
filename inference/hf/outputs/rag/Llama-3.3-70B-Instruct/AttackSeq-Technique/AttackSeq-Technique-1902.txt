To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before TeamTNT's script used iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the execution of a coin miner saved as /usr/sbin/docker-update and the subsequent use of iplogger.org by TeamTNT's script. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the host, executed their payload (the coin miner), and are now in the phase of gathering information about the infected hosts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include techniques under the tactics of Collection (T1056.001-Keylogging), Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery), and Command and Control (T1102-Web Service). These techniques suggest activities related to gathering information and controlling the infected systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**: This technique involves modifying the firmware of a device, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario described, where the focus is on tracking infected hosts and obtaining their details after executing a coin miner.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the network connections of a system, which could be relevant for understanding the environment but doesn't directly precede the action of tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.
   - **C: T1595-Active Scanning**: Active scanning involves scanning for specific information or vulnerabilities, which might be part of the process but doesn't directly relate to the use of iplogger.org for tracking infected hosts.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves discovering local accounts on a system, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly relate to the action described.

However, considering the context of tracking infected hosts and obtaining their details, the most relevant technique from the provided options that likely occurred before this action would involve discovering system information. The use of iplogger.org suggests that the attackers are interested in the details of the infected hosts, which aligns more closely with system information discovery than with the other options provided.

Given the context and the goal of tracking infected hosts, **T1082-System Information Discovery** is the most relevant technique from the related TTPs, but it's not among the answer choices. However, looking at the answer choices provided and considering the closest match in terms of the sequence of actions (executing a payload and then wanting to understand the environment or gather more information), **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** seems to be the closest in terms of discovery and reconnaissance activities that would precede or accompany the tracking of infected hosts. It's about understanding the network environment, which could be a step in managing or exploiting the infected hosts further.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question describes a scenario where a coin miner is executed, and then the attackers use iplogger.org to track infected hosts.
2. The related TTPs suggest activities focused on collection, discovery, and command and control.
3. The most relevant technique to the scenario described (tracking infected hosts) involves some form of discovery or information gathering about the hosts.
4. Among the answer choices, **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** is the closest to a discovery activity that would precede or be relevant to tracking and managing infected hosts.

**Final Answer**: B
