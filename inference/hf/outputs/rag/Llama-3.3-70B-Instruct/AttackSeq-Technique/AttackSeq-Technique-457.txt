To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CEIDPageLock rootkit has already been installed and is gathering browsing data. It needs to establish communication with its command and control (C&C) servers to download the homepage configuration. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for this communication to happen.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This involves using DNS as a means of communication with C&C servers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This seems to be related to developing resources through drive-by compromises, but it's less directly relevant to the communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**: This technique is unrelated to the communication with C&C servers for downloading configurations.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique could potentially be related to communication, but it's not directly mentioned in the provided TTPs and seems less relevant to the specific action of downloading configurations from C&C servers.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is about using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario of a rootkit communicating with its C&C servers. Given that T1071.004-DNS is mentioned under Command and Control, it suggests that application layer protocols (which could include DNS or HTTP) are used for communication.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique is related to initial access, not to the establishment of communication with C&C servers after initial access has been gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the communication between the rootkit and its C&C servers.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique for establishing communication with C&C servers to download configurations.
   
Final Answer: C
