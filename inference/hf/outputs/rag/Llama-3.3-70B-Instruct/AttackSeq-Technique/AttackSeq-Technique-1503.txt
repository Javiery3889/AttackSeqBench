To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Iron group's installer checked for VM execution and dropped a backdoor DLL, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of a previously unknown backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code. This indicates a sophisticated attack involving custom or modified malware. The installer checks for VM execution, suggesting the attackers are trying to avoid detection in a virtualized environment, and then drops a backdoor DLL. This implies the attackers are seeking persistence and possibly evasion techniques to maintain access to the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL from a non-standard location, which can be used to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This involves deleting files to evade detection, which could be part of hiding the backdoor or other malicious components.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is a repeat of the persistence technique, emphasizing its potential use also for defense evasion by loading malicious DLLs in a way that avoids detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053.002-At**: This refers to Scheduled Task/Job (Windows Task Scheduler) used for persistence, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate actions after dropping a backdoor DLL.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container**: This involves deploying a container, which doesn't directly follow from the actions described (checking for VM execution and dropping a backdoor DLL).
   - **C: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves creating or modifying system services, which could be a step after establishing a backdoor to maintain persistence but doesn't directly relate to the action of dropping a DLL.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: Given the context of dropping a backdoor DLL and the emphasis on evasion techniques (like checking for VM execution), hiding artifacts (including the backdoor) would be a logical next step to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes actions leading to the deployment of a backdoor, indicating a need for persistence and evasion.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques for persistence and defense evasion, particularly focusing on DLL side-loading, which is relevant to the dropped backdoor DLL.
   - Considering the need to avoid detection after dropping a malicious DLL, hiding artifacts becomes a crucial step for the attackers to maintain their presence without being detected.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after dropping a backdoor DLL, given the context and related TTPs, is to hide artifacts to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
