To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after the Discovery phase, an attacker is looking to gather screen recording files during the Collection phase. The Discovery phase involved collecting basic system information such as IP address, hostname, and Bitcoin wallet addresses. The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique used to gather screen recording files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
   These TTPs indicate that the attacker has already performed system and network discovery, gathering information about the system and its network configuration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1036.006-Space after Filename**: This technique involves using a space at the end of a filename to potentially bypass security controls. It doesn't directly relate to gathering screen recording files.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen, which could include gathering screen recording files. It directly aligns with the goal of collecting visual information from the target system.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows Registry for system configuration and settings. While useful for discovery, it doesn't directly relate to gathering screen recordings.
   - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves collecting data from messaging applications, which doesn't directly relate to gathering screen recording files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the attacker is in the Collection phase and aims to gather screen recording files.
   - The provided TTPs indicate the attacker has already performed discovery and is likely looking for more specific data.
   - Among the given options, **B: T1113-Screen Capture** is the most relevant technique for gathering screen recording files, as it directly involves capturing the screen, which can include recording activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for gathering screen recording files after the initial discovery phase would involve using the Screen Capture technique.

Final Answer: B
