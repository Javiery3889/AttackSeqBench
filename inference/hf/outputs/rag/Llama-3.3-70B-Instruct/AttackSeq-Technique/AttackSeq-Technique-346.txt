To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors gain initial access to a system through a compromised software update, utilizing the Supply Chain Compromise technique (T1195). After gaining access, they execute code using system services. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this execution of code.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain
   These TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved by compromising the supply chain, specifically through software updates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to get a list of running processes to understand the system's running context. While it could be a part of the post-exploitation activities, it doesn't directly relate to executing code using system services.
   - **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This sub-technique is about evading detection by clearing persistence mechanisms. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of code via system services.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This sub-technique involves using specific tools (AutoHotKey and AutoIT) for executing code, but it's more about using these tools for execution rather than leveraging system services directly.
   - **D: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute commands or programs. Given that the question specifies the execution of code using system services after initial access, this technique directly aligns with the described action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that after gaining initial access, the threat actors executed code using system services.
   - The related TTPs indicate initial access was gained through supply chain compromise.
   - Among the given options, **T1569-System Services** is the technique that directly involves executing code or commands using system services, which matches the action described in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves using system services for code execution after initial access.

Final Answer: D
