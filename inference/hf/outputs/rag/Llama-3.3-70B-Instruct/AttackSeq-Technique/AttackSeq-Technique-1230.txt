To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where POWERSHOWER, presumably a piece of malware or a threat actor, has collected system information and transmitted it to a Command and Control (C2) server. After this action, it enters a communications loop utilizing a proxy. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this proxy utilization.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (use of proxies for communication) and Collection (automated collection of data). Specifically, the techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This involves using an external proxy to hide the true source of traffic.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system.
   - **T1090-Proxy**: A broader category involving the use of a proxy for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This involves using multiple proxies to further obscure the source of traffic. While it's a form of proxy usage, the question doesn't specify the use of multiple hops.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This is a general technique for using a proxy, which aligns with the scenario of entering a communications loop by utilizing a proxy. However, it's less specific than T1090.002-External Proxy but still relevant.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which doesn't directly relate to the use of proxies for communication.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario described.

Given the context, the most relevant technique before entering a communications loop by utilizing a proxy, especially considering the transmission of collected system information, would involve setting up or using a proxy for command and control purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves collecting system information and transmitting it, which suggests a need for command and control communication.
   - The use of a proxy is mentioned as a method to facilitate this communication, indicating the involvement of proxy-related techniques.
   - Among the provided options, **T1090-Proxy** is the most directly related to the scenario of utilizing a proxy for communication purposes, as it broadly encompasses the use of proxies for command and control, which would include the action of entering a communications loop by utilizing a proxy.

**Final Answer: B**
