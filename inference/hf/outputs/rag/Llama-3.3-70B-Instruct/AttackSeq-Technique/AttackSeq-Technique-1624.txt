To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used by APT28 for secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component advstoreshell.dll, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the method APT28 used to communicate securely with their Command and Control (C&C) servers after deploying a backdoor. This implies we are looking for a technique related to secure communication or encryption.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This involves transferring data in a scheduled manner, which doesn't directly imply secure communication but does suggest a method for data transfer.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication that can go both ways between the adversary and the compromised system, which is crucial for C&C but doesn't specifically address the security of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This involves using additional or alternative communication channels in case the primary one is compromised, which is about redundancy rather than security.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to hide malicious activity, which doesn't directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This involves using standard web protocols for C&C communication, which could be secure depending on the implementation (e.g., HTTPS) but doesn't inherently imply security.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique specifically involves creating an encrypted channel for C&C communication, directly addressing the need for secure communication.
   - **D: T1218.014-MMC**: This doesn't directly relate to the context provided, as it's more about exploiting vulnerabilities in software rather than establishing secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of needing secure communication with C&C servers after deploying a backdoor, the focus should be on techniques that enhance the security of this communication.
   - Among the provided options, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly addresses the need for secure communication by encrypting the channel used for C&C communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers is the one that explicitly involves encryption.

Final Answer: C
