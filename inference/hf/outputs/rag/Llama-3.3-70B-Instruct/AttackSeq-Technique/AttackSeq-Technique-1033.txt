To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Kingslayer backdoor being loaded via a malicious 'Alpha' software subversion. This implies an initial compromise where malicious software was introduced, potentially through a supply chain attack or by exploiting vulnerabilities in software. The backdoor's ability to evade detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm suggests techniques focused on maintaining access and evading detection.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This suggests the attacker is using time-based evasion techniques to avoid detection, which aligns with the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm mentioned.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This further emphasizes the use of time-based evasion for defense evasion purposes, indicating the attacker's focus on remaining undetected.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**: While remote access software could be used for maintaining access, the question specifically mentions evasion techniques, not the initial access method.
   - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique involves obtaining credentials for a domain controller, which doesn't directly relate to the evasion technique described.
   - **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**: Polymorphic code is used to evade detection by changing the code's form, which could be related to evasion but doesn't directly match the "diurnal beacon sleep algorithm" description.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: Subverting trust controls involves manipulating or compromising the systems or processes that manage trust within an environment, which could include software subversion as mentioned in the question.

Given the context of the Kingslayer backdoor being loaded via malicious software subversion and the emphasis on evasion techniques, the most relevant technique that likely occurred before evasion would involve compromising trust in the system or software. This points towards manipulating or subverting the controls that manage trust, which aligns with the description of the malicious 'Alpha' software subversion.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial compromise method: Malicious software subversion.
2. Understand the evasion technique: Diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for time-based evasion.
3. Match the evasion technique with the provided TTPs: Time-based evasion is directly mentioned.
4. Determine the most plausible preceding technique: Given the context, subverting trust controls (through software subversion) would logically precede the evasion efforts.

**Final Answer**: D
