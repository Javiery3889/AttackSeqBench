To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a malware making a POST request to a C2 (Command and Control) domain, indicating communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control. Specifically, T1071.001-Web Protocols is mentioned, which involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communications. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer refers to the technique of transferring tools or payloads into a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This involves using mail protocols for C2 communications, which doesn't directly relate to transferring tools or payloads via a POST request to a C2 domain.
   - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique is about obtaining access to a domain controller, which is not directly related to the transfer of tools or payloads to communicate with C2 domains.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique directly involves transferring tools or payloads into a compromised system, which aligns with the scenario of communicating with multiple C2 domains after initial contact.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used for initial access, not for transferring tools or payloads after a system is compromised.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has already established communication with a C2 domain, indicating the system is compromised.
   - The focus is on the transfer of additional tools or payloads to facilitate further communication with multiple C2 domains.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the technique that directly addresses the transfer of tools or payloads into a compromised system, which would be necessary for communicating with 13 identified C2 domains.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer to facilitate the described communication.

Final Answer: C
