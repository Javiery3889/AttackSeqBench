To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the CopyKittens attack group's use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The CopyKittens attack group is using a multi-stage infection framework. This implies a complex attack sequence involving several tactics and techniques to achieve their goals, including evasion and persistence.

2. **Given Techniques**:
   - **Global Mutex**: A global mutex is a synchronization object that can be used by malware to ensure that only one instance of the malware is running on a system at any given time. This is often used to prevent detection and to ensure that the malware's actions are not interfered with by concurrent instances.
   - **Runtime API Address Resolution**: This technique involves resolving API addresses at runtime rather than hardcoding them. This is a form of **T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution**, which is listed under the Defense Evasion tactic. It's used to evade detection by making it harder for security software to predict and intercept the malware's API calls.

3. **Analyzing Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This involves using native APIs to execute malicious code. While relevant to the execution phase, it doesn't directly follow the evasion techniques mentioned.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique is about establishing command and control (C2) communications through multiple stages, which fits with the multi-stage infection framework but doesn't directly relate to the evasion techniques used.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution**: This is directly related to the runtime API address resolution mentioned and indicates the group's focus on evasion.

4. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1070.007-Clear Network Connection History and Configurations**: This technique involves clearing network connection history to evade detection, which could be a follow-up action to hide tracks but doesn't directly relate to the use of a global mutex and dynamic API resolution.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: Data obfuscation is a technique used to hide or obscure data, which could be used in conjunction with the mentioned evasion techniques but doesn't directly follow from them.
   - **C: T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique is related to accessing or manipulating print processors, which doesn't directly follow from the evasion techniques mentioned.
   - **D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**: Debugger evasion techniques are used to prevent debuggers from attaching to a process, which aligns with the evasion theme and could logically follow the use of a global mutex and dynamic API resolution as part of a broader evasion strategy.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of evasion and the specific techniques mentioned (global mutex and runtime API address resolution), the most plausible next step in the sequence that aligns with the ATT&CK framework and the provided related TTPs would be to further evade detection, particularly from debuggers that might be used to analyze the malware.

Final Answer: D
