To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Derusbi has already gathered system information for discovery purposes. Now, it needs to establish communication with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP POST requests to a specific URL (/photos/photo.asp). The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred for this purpose.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the technique **T1071.001-Web Protocols**. This suggests the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, with the technique **T1082-System Information Discovery**. This is about gathering information about the system, which has already been done by Derusbi according to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery** is already done, as per the question, so it's not what's being asked.
   - **B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** could be relevant in a broader sense since establishing C2 often involves bidirectional communication, but the question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests, which points more towards using a specific protocol for communication.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call** doesn't directly relate to the use of HTTP for C2 communication.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant because it involves using application-layer protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario of using HTTP POST requests to communicate with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of HTTP POST requests for C2 communication.
   - T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is directly related to using protocols at the application layer (like HTTP) for communication, which fits the scenario.
   - Given that T1071.001 (Web Protocols) is a sub-technique under T1071 and is mentioned in the related TTPs, it further supports that the correct answer involves the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for establishing communication with the C2 server via HTTP POST requests would involve using an application layer protocol, specifically web protocols.

Final Answer: D
