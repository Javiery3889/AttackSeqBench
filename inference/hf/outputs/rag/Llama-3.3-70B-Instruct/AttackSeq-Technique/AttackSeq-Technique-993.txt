To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through a phishing email, followed by the execution of a VBS script that drops a JavaScript backdoor. After this, the malware executes an obfuscated script and loads a DLL file into memory. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this process.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves the adversary deobfuscating or decoding files or information that was previously encoded to conceal its purpose.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a DLL from a non-standard location, which can be used to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves using JavaScript for execution, which aligns with the JavaScript backdoor mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication, which does not directly relate to the execution of an obfuscated script and loading a DLL.
   - **Option B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This technique is about hiding email rules, which does not fit the context of executing scripts and loading DLLs.
   - **Option C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules, which could relate to loading DLLs, but it's not as specific to the context of loading a DLL in memory as another option might be.
   - **Option D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This option is not directly related to the execution of scripts and loading of DLLs in the context provided.

Given the context of executing an obfuscated script and loading a DLL file into memory, and considering the related TTPs, the most relevant technique seems to be **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**. However, this option is not directly listed, but **T1129-Shared Modules** is the closest in relation to the action of loading a DLL, which could be considered under the broader context of shared modules or dynamic loading of libraries.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access and execution of a JavaScript backdoor set the stage for further malicious activity.
2. The execution of an obfuscated script suggests techniques like deobfuscation (T1140) might be involved, but this is not an answer choice.
3. Loading a DLL file into memory directly points towards techniques involving dynamic library loading.
4. Among the given options, **T1129-Shared Modules** is the closest to involving the concept of loading modules (like DLLs) into memory, even though it's not a perfect match for the described action.

**Final Answer: C**
