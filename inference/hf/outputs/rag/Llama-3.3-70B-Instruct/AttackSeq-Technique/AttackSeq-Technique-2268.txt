To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a PowerShell script is used to communicate with domains for downloading malware and sending collected data (email accounts) after exfiltration. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that facilitated this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the Exfiltration tactic and include:
   - **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system without the need for manual operator interaction.
   - **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is a communication channel used by attackers to control compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic, which might not directly relate to the communication between a PowerShell script and external domains for downloading malware and sending data.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute scripts during PowerShell initialization, which doesn't directly relate to the communication for exfiltration or downloading malware.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email, which is part of the scenario but doesn't directly address the communication method used by the PowerShell script.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for communication. Given that the question mentions a POST web request for exfiltrating email accounts and the context of downloading malware and sending collected data, using an application layer protocol (like HTTP for the web request) seems highly relevant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method of communication used by a PowerShell script to interact with domains for malicious purposes.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration tactics, indicating the importance of how data and malware are moved.
   - The use of a POST web request implies an application layer protocol.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that facilitated this communication is related to using application layer protocols.

Final Answer: D
