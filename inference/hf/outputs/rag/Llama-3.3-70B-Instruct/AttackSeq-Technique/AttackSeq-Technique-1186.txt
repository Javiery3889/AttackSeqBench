To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a backdoor function gathering machine information during the Discovery phase. This implies the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now looking to extract more information, specifically visual data. The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves techniques used to gather information about the system, its configuration, and the environment it operates in.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
   These techniques are used to gather system information and system time, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question. The focus here is on discovering system details, which is a precursor to more targeted information gathering, such as extracting visual data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system, which directly aligns with extracting visual data. Given that the backdoor has already gathered machine information, the next logical step to further extract visual data would indeed be to capture the screen.
   - **B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities, which doesn't directly relate to extracting visual data from the system.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique is about using web services to establish a command and control channel or exfiltrate data but doesn't directly relate to extracting visual data.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**: This is not directly related to the extraction of visual data from a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the need to extract visual data after gathering machine information.
   - The related TTPs indicate the attacker is in the Discovery phase, focusing on system information.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1113-Screen Capture** is the technique that directly involves extracting visual data from the victim's system, aligning with the next logical step after system information discovery.

Final Answer: A
