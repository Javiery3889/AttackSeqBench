To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The Lazarus group has already executed credential harvesting using Responder, which is associated with LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay (T1557.001), and gained login credentials for lateral movement. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they continued with network share and system network connections discovery activities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information about the network.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This is also about network sniffing but categorized under credential access, possibly for intercepting credentials.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This is related to the initial credential harvesting method mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. While it could be used for various purposes, including persistence or privilege escalation, it doesn't directly relate to the discovery activities mentioned.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the network connections of a system, which aligns with the activities mentioned (network share and system network connections discovery). However, the question asks for what happened before these activities.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols, which doesn't directly precede network discovery activities.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the owners or users of a system, which could logically precede network share and system network connections discovery as it helps in understanding the network layout and potential targets for further exploitation.

Given the context that the attackers have already gained credentials and are looking to move laterally, discovering who the system owners or users are (to identify potential targets for lateral movement or to understand the network layout better) seems like a logical step before engaging in network share and system network connections discovery activities.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attackers have credentials and aim for lateral movement.
2. They need to understand the network and system layout.
3. Identifying system owners/users helps in targeting specific systems or users for further exploitation or movement.

**Final Answer**: D
