To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after gathering system and environmental information using discovery techniques, the attackers are looking to scan files for credential-related databases. This implies the attackers are in the process of attempting to gain access to credentials, which falls under the "Credential Access" tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from web browsers, which aligns with scanning for credential-related databases from browsers like Firefox.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This involves gathering credentials as part of the reconnaissance phase, which could be related but is broader than what the question specifically asks.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is about discovering files and directories on the system, which is part of the discovery phase mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could potentially reveal credentials but doesn't directly relate to scanning files for credential databases.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique directly involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which could include those from web browsers and email clients. It aligns closely with the action of scanning files for credential-related databases.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is related to signaling to the attacker that a system has been compromised, which doesn't directly relate to the action of scanning for credentials.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: While this involves searching databases, it's more focused on open technical databases rather than credential databases on a compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that after gathering system information, the attackers are looking to scan files for credential-related databases.
   - The most relevant technique to this action, based on the provided TTPs and the description, is obtaining credentials from specific stores like web browsers and email clients.
   - **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** directly relates to scanning for and obtaining credentials from password stores, which includes databases from Firefox and email clients.

Final Answer: B
