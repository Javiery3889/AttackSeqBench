To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by FamousSparrow for data exfiltration after the initial communication and encryption/decryption steps, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where SparrowDoor, presumably a backdoor or malware, communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server using HTTPS, a secure communication protocol. This communication is further encrypted and decrypted using different multi-byte XOR keys, indicating an attempt to maintain secrecy and evade detection. The question specifically asks about the method of data exfiltration used by FamousSparrow after this communication has been established.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the tactic of Exfiltration, which is the act of transferring data from a system without authorization. The techniques mentioned are:
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. Given that SparrowDoor has already established communication with the C&C server, this technique seems directly relevant.
   - **T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using asymmetric encryption over a non-command and control protocol. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the specific use of asymmetric encryption and a non-C2 protocol is not directly implied.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A and D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: Given that SparrowDoor has established a C2 channel with the server and the question mentions encrypted/decrypted communications, exfiltrating data over this established channel (T1041) seems the most logical and efficient method. This technique directly aligns with the scenario described.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data after a C2 channel has been established.
   - **C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique is about discovering security software, which is not relevant to the act of exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a C2 channel is established and used for encrypted communication.
   - The related TTPs suggest that exfiltration is the goal, with a specific technique (T1041) directly related to using a C2 channel for exfiltration.
   - The most logical step after establishing a secure, encrypted C2 channel would be to use this channel for exfiltrating data, as it is already set up for secure communication.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with the scenario and the related TTPs is the one that involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: A
