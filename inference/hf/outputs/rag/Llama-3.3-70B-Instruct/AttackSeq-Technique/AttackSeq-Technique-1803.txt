To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where instructions are received from C2 (Command and Control) servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. This action is aimed at disrupting websites that promote democracy in Hong Kong. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred in this context.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with the techniques:
     - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to avoid detection.
     - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about making encoded or encrypted data readable.

   These TTPs suggest that the attacker's goal is to evade detection, possibly by encoding files to hide malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves adding entries to autostart directories to execute malicious programs. While it's a method for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to encoding files or disrupting websites.
   - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique involves flooding a network with traffic to disrupt service. It could be related to disrupting websites but doesn't directly involve encoding files.
   - **C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**: Similar to B, this involves exhausting system resources, which could disrupt services but doesn't directly relate to the encoding of files.
   - **D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This option is not directly related to the provided context of encoding files or the typical methods of disrupting websites.

   Given the context of encoding files and the goal of disrupting websites, none of the provided answer choices directly match the action of encoding files for the purpose of evasion or disruption as described. However, the closest in terms of impact on websites and potential for disruption, considering the encoding as a precursor to other actions, would be related to disrupting service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question hints at a specific action (encoding configuration files) that is part of a larger operation to disrupt websites.
   - The provided TTPs suggest a focus on evasion techniques, which might not directly answer the question about disrupting websites but indicate the attackers are trying to hide their tracks.
   - The closest answer choice related to disrupting websites, given the context, involves techniques that could lead to service disruption, even though none directly mention encoding.

Given the information and the need to select the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described, the answer that aligns with the goal of disrupting websites (though not perfectly matching the encoding action described) would be related to disrupting service. However, it's crucial to note that the provided answer choices do not directly address the encoding action as a method for disrupting websites.

**Final Answer: B**
