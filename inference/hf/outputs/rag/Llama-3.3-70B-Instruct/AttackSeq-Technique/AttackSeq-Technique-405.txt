To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious Excel file gains initial access, macros are enabled to construct a PE (Portable Executable) file, and then the Gholee malware uses ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C for process execution while attempting to hide its activity. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs before this process execution step.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP is T1204.002, which refers to a malicious file. This indicates that the initial access and subsequent actions are facilitated by a malicious file, in this case, an Excel file with macros.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) for executing commands. While it's a method for code execution, the scenario specifically mentions macros constructing a PE file and then using ShellExecute, which doesn't directly imply DDE.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. Given that the scenario mentions using cmd.exe /C for process execution, this technique seems closely related to the described actions. The use of macros to construct a PE file and then executing it via cmd.exe aligns with utilizing a command and scripting interpreter for execution.
   - **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**: This technique is related to using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for establishing a command and control channel or other malicious activities. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of a PE file via cmd.exe.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While it's relevant to communication, it doesn't directly relate to the execution method described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes initial access via a malicious Excel file with macros, leading to the construction of a PE file.
   - The execution of this PE file is done through cmd.exe /C, which is a command and scripting interpreter.
   - Given the direct mention of cmd.exe /C for process execution, the most relevant technique before this execution, considering the context of running commands and scripts, is the use of a command and scripting interpreter.

Final Answer: B
