To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Welcome Chat app ensured its functionality was activated at every device startup and before it exfiltrated sent and received SMS messages, call logs, and other sensitive user data, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious app, Welcome Chat, has ensured it starts up with every device boot. This implies the app has achieved persistence. After achieving persistence, the next logical steps for an adversary would involve gathering information about the system or the user to decide what data to collect or how to proceed with the attack. The question specifically mentions the exfiltration of sensitive user data like SMS messages, call logs, etc., which suggests that before exfiltration, the app would need to identify what data is available and accessible.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves collecting chat messages, which aligns with the app's interest in SMS messages but is more focused on the content rather than the system itself.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from the local system, which could include call logs and other sensitive user data. However, this is more about the action of collecting data rather than the reconnaissance needed before collection.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is about exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is what happens after the data has been collected.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique is about collecting email, which is not directly mentioned in the scenario provided.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This involves using default accounts, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of ensuring startup functionality and then exfiltrating specific types of user data.
   - **C: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering system services, which could be relevant for understanding what services are running and potentially where data might be stored or how to access it. However, it's more about system services rather than the specific data of interest (SMS, call logs).
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system, which could include understanding what data is available for collection. This seems like a logical step before collecting and exfiltrating specific data types, as it would help the adversary understand what can be collected.

Given the need for the app to understand what data is available on the system before collecting and exfiltrating it, **T1082-System Information Discovery** seems the most plausible technique. It aligns with the necessity of reconnaissance before data collection and exfiltration, fitting the sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: D**
