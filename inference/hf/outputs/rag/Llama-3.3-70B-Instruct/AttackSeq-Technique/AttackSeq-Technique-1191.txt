To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an RMS (possibly a Remote Management System or a similar tool) executable evades detection by utilizing legitimate application functions. After evasion, it establishes communication with a Command and Control (C2) server in Germany. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this communication establishment.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Defense Evasion tactics, specifically:
   - **T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves masquerading as a legitimate process or service to avoid detection, which aligns with the initial part of the scenario where the RMS tool evades detection.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This involves renaming system utilities to blend in with legitimate system activities, also related to evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code in the context of a user's login session. While it's a relevant technique for many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing DNS entries to make it difficult to track and block C2 communications. It's relevant to C2 communication but doesn't directly match the scenario described, which focuses on the establishment of communication rather than its obfuscation.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication. Given that the RMS executable needs to communicate with a C2 server, using an application-layer protocol is a plausible method for this communication.
   - **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically focusing on the use of web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for C2 communication. This could be a very specific instance of how the communication with the C2 server is established, especially if the communication is happening over the web.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes the RMS tool evading detection and then establishing communication with a C2 server. The focus is on the method of communication rather than the evasion itself.
   - Given the need for the RMS executable to communicate with a C2 server, techniques related to C2 communication are most relevant.
   - Between options C and D, which both relate to application-layer protocols, **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols** is a more specific instance of using web protocols for C2 communication, which is a common method for such communications due to its ability to blend in with normal web traffic.

**Final Answer: D**
