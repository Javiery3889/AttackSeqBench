To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses and sent socially engineered emails that led to the execution of malicious documents. This action is followed by the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications for initial access by Taidoor. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic of Initial Access and a technique of T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment. This indicates that the initial access tactic involves spearphishing, which is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send emails that appear to be from a trusted source, often with the goal of getting the recipient to open a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to a system. While it could be a method for initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the scenario described, which involves socially engineered emails and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which would typically occur after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**: This technique involves re-opening applications to maintain persistence, which also would occur after initial access.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique of using phishing, a form of social engineering, to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Given that the scenario describes socially engineered emails leading to the execution of malicious documents, this technique directly aligns with the actions described before the exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes a targeted phishing campaign (spoofing government email addresses and sending socially engineered emails) aimed at getting recipients to execute malicious documents.
   - The related TTPs highlight spearphishing attachment as a technique under the initial access tactic, which aligns with the described actions.
   - Phishing (T1566) is the broader category under which spearphishing falls, and it is the technique that would occur before the exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial access, as it is the method used to trick users into executing the malicious documents that exploit those vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: D
