To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where data has been processed and encrypted with AES by WinDealer before exfiltration. The focus is on maintaining communication with a Command and Control (C2) server using specific ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556). The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for this purpose.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This indicates that the exfiltration of data is happening over a channel established for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the technique **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**. This suggests the use of non-standard protocols for C2 communication, which could involve using specific ports for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using unusual ports for communication, which could apply since the question mentions specific, potentially non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) for C2 communication.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: While encryption is mentioned in the question (AES encryption of data), this technique specifically refers to the encryption of the C2 channel itself, not just the data being exfiltrated.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique is about discovering software on the target system, which does not directly relate to maintaining C2 communication.
   - **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**: This involves the use of digital certificates for authentication, which is not directly implied in the scenario described.

Given the context of maintaining communication with a C2 server using specific ports, the most relevant technique seems to be the use of non-standard ports for this communication, especially since the ports mentioned (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) are not standard ports for common applications or services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used to maintain communication with the C2 server.
   - The use of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 suggests a non-standard approach to communication.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration over a C2 channel and the use of non-application layer protocols, supporting the idea of unconventional communication methods.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred, given the specifics of the ports and the context of C2 communication, is the use of non-standard ports.

Final Answer: A
