To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely secures communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C (Command and Control) server after the Delphi downloader has gathered system information and sent it to the C&C server. This implies we are looking for a technique related to securing or encrypting the communication channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to Command and Control, which is the tactic of interest. The techniques mentioned include:
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: Using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels**: Establishing fallback channels for C2 communication in case primary channels are disrupted.
   - **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: Using symmetric cryptography to secure C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerable systems or services, which does not directly relate to securing communication between a backdoor and a C&C server.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves creating an encrypted channel for C2 communication, which aligns with securing the communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS**: While DNS can be used for C2 communication (as seen in T1071.001-Web Protocols, but specifically for DNS in T1071.004), it does not inherently secure the communication.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which does not directly relate to securing C2 communication.

Given the context of securing communication and the provided related TTPs, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant technique for securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server. The mention of **T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography** as a related TTP further supports this choice, as symmetric cryptography is a method used to create an encrypted channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the need for securing C2 communication.
2. Analyze related TTPs for relevance to securing communication.
3. Evaluate answer choices against the need for securing C2 communication and the context provided by related TTPs.
4. Select the answer choice that best aligns with securing C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B**
