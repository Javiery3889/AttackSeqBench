To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the attackers performed discovery activities, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already executed commands to discover system network connections. This implies they are in the process of gathering information about the system and its network. The techniques mentioned involve discovering task lists, directory listings, and system information, which are all part of the discovery phase of an attack.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include techniques under the "Discovery" tactic, such as T1018 (Remote System Discovery) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery). These techniques are about gathering information on remote systems and files/directories, which aligns with the discovery activities mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network connections of a system. Given that the question mentions the execution of commands to discover system network connections, this technique seems to have already been performed or is being performed, making it less likely to be the next step.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is typically a technique used to maintain access to a compromised system or to exfiltrate data without being detected. While it could occur after discovery, it doesn't directly follow from the discovery activities described.
   - **C: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the running processes on a system. Given the context of discovering task lists, directory listings, and system information, discovering running processes is a logical next step in the discovery phase, as it provides more detailed information about what is currently active on the system.
   - **D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: Searching victim-owned websites is more related to gathering information from external sources rather than from the infected host itself. This doesn't directly follow the discovery activities focused on the system and its network connections.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes activities focused on discovering system details and network connections.
   - The related TTPs emphasize discovery tactics, indicating the attackers are in the information-gathering phase.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1057-Process Discovery** is the most directly related to the next logical step after discovering system network connections and gathering system information. It aligns with the ongoing discovery activities and provides more specific information about the system's current state.

Final Answer: C
