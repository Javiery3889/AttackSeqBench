To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a Milestone backdoor sending session information to a C2 (Command and Control) server. This action implies that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now exfiltrating data. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before this data exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Exfiltration and the technique of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This indicates that the focus is on how data is being extracted from the compromised system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into a website. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation for exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the software running on a system. It's plausible that before exfiltrating data, an attacker would want to understand the software environment to choose the right method for data extraction and to avoid detection.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. While relevant to the communication aspect, the question specifies that the communication is already happening over an uncompressed channel, making this more about the method of communication rather than a preparatory step.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**: This technique involves using a rootkit to hide malicious activity. While rootkits can be used to maintain access and hide C2 communications, the question focuses on the action before the exfiltration, not necessarily on hiding the exfiltration process itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration of session information.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration as the tactic, indicating the attacker's goal is to extract data.
   - Among the answer choices, **B: T1518-Software Discovery** stands out as a logical preparatory step for exfiltration. Understanding the software environment would help in selecting the appropriate method for exfiltrating data without being detected.
   - Therefore, discovering the software environment would be a plausible step before exfiltrating data, as it aids in planning the exfiltration method.

Final Answer: B
