To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred as attackers initiated their campaign to deliver malicious attachments before executing the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan. This implies we are looking for an initial access technique that involves delivering malicious content to the victim.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Command and Control" and "Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port." While these are relevant for understanding the context of command and control communications, they don't directly relate to the initial access vector. However, knowing that the attackers use TCP port 80 (a standard port) for C&C communication, and considering the context of delivering malicious attachments, we can infer the initial access method likely involves social engineering or exploiting a vulnerability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1074-Data Staged**: This technique involves staging data in a location to be collected later. While data staging can be part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the initial delivery of malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a link via spearphishing that leads to a malicious website or downloads malware. This could be a plausible initial access vector but specifically mentions a link, not attachments.
   - **C: T1098.006-Additional Container Cluster Roles**: This option seems unrelated to the initial delivery of malicious attachments and more related to containerization and role assignments within a cloud or containerized environment.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is a broader category that includes spearphishing and involves tricking a user into disclosing information or performing a certain action, such as opening a malicious attachment. Given the context of delivering malicious attachments, this seems the most likely initial access technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the delivery of malicious attachments as the initial step in an attack campaign.
   - The related TTPs provide context but don't directly address the initial access vector.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1566-Phishing** is the most relevant to delivering malicious attachments, as it encompasses various phishing techniques, including those that involve attachments.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with phishing as the initial access technique to deliver the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.

Final Answer: D
