To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after LightNeuron discovered network configurations but before it used emails as a channel for exfiltrating collected data, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by LightNeuron, starting with the discovery of network configurations using specific APIs (GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName), which is related to system network configuration discovery. This is followed by an unspecified action, and then the use of emails for exfiltrating collected data.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This is directly related to the initial action described, where LightNeuron uses APIs to gather network configuration information.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates the method used for exfiltrating data, which in the question is specified as using emails as a channel.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions described (discovery and exfiltration).
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is the exfiltration technique, which aligns with the action of using emails for exfiltration but doesn't specify the collection or processing of data before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system. Given that LightNeuron has already discovered network configurations and before it exfiltrates data, it's plausible that it would collect data in an automated manner.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**: This technique doesn't directly relate to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - LightNeuron starts by discovering network configurations, which is a discovery tactic.
   - Before exfiltrating data, it's logical that LightNeuron would collect the data it intends to exfiltrate.
   - The use of emails for exfiltration is specified, but the question asks for the technique that occurred before this exfiltration.

Given the sequence and the provided TTPs, **T1119-Automated Collection** is the most plausible technique that occurred after the discovery of network configurations and before the exfiltration of data via emails. This is because after discovering the network, the next logical step would be to collect data in an automated manner before exfiltrating it.

**Final Answer: C**
