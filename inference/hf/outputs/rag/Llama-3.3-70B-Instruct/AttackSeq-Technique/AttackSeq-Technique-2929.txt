To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates from game production environments, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, and then collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments. This implies that before collecting the sensitive data, APT41 must have gained access to the network and moved laterally to reach the desired systems.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This suggests that tools were transferred within the network to facilitate movement, which is relevant to how APT41 moved between systems.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This implies that APT41 might have used code signing to evade detection, possibly using stolen digital certificates.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This indicates that APT41 was involved in gathering credentials, which could be used for initial access or lateral movement.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could include source code and digital certificates. However, it doesn't directly imply the action that occurred before the collection.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique is about capturing screen data, which doesn't directly relate to the lateral movement or the collection of source code and digital certificates.
   - **C: T1659-Content Injection**: This involves injecting content into a website, which doesn't directly relate to the described actions of APT41.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is a technique used for initial access, which could have been used to gain the initial foothold in the network before moving laterally and collecting data.

Given the context that APT41 moved laterally and collected sensitive data, the most plausible initial step would involve gaining access to the network. Among the provided options, **T1566-Phishing** is a common technique used for initial access, which could have been used to gain the initial foothold in the network. After gaining access, APT41 could then move laterally, pivot between systems, and collect the desired data.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the need for initial access to the network.
2. Recognize that lateral movement and data collection are post-initial access activities.
3. Evaluate the answer choices for the most likely initial access technique.
4. Select the answer choice that best aligns with gaining initial access to the network.

**Final Answer**: D
