To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the CostaRicto Campaign used techniques like a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection to inject the final payload DLL into memory, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor. This indicates an initial stage of an attack where the attackers are trying to establish a foothold in the system. The use of a PowerShell loader with Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection for injecting a final payload DLL into memory suggests a method of executing code in a way that evades detection, which is a common goal in the Defense Evasion tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are all categorized under the Defense Evasion tactic, which involves techniques used by attackers to evade detection and bypass security controls. Specifically:
   - **T1620-Reflective Code Loading** is a technique where code is loaded into memory without being written to disk, making it harder to detect.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection** and **T1055-Process Injection** are techniques used to inject code into running processes, allowing attackers to hide their malicious code within legitimate processes.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**: This involves using digital certificates to make malicious code appear legitimate. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence described.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the source of traffic. It's more related to Command and Control (C2) communication rather than the execution and evasion techniques described.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute malicious code, which aligns with the initial part of the question that mentions payload stagers being executed using scheduled tasks.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This involves using shared modules to hide malicious code. While it's a defense evasion technique, it doesn't directly fit the sequence of using scheduled tasks and then injecting a payload DLL into memory.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a sequence starting with the use of scheduled tasks for executing payload stagers.
   - The related TTPs focus on defense evasion techniques, particularly those involving code injection and reflective loading.
   - Given that **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** directly matches the initial action described (using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor), and considering the context of defense evasion and code injection provided by the related TTPs, **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is the most likely technique to have occurred before the injection of the final payload DLL into memory using a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.

Final Answer: C
