To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools and utilized PRC-linked infrastructure, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before they employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution. This implies we are looking for an initial step or preparatory phase in their operation that precedes the use of specific execution tools.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development**, with a **Technique: T1588.002-Tool**. This suggests the development or acquisition of tools, which aligns with the group developing its own remote access tools.
   - **Tactic: Execution**, with a **Technique: T1053.002** (though not fully specified, T1053 generally refers to Scheduled Task/Job). However, the specific mention of "At" might imply a focus on scheduling or executing tasks, but it's less directly relevant to the initial phase of obtaining or developing capabilities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common initial vector for many attacks, used to gain initial access. However, the question focuses on the development and use of tools, not necessarily the initial access vector.
   - **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves using web cookies for session hijacking or other malicious purposes, which doesn't directly relate to the development or employment of remote access tools.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This involves compromising software supply chains, which could be a method to obtain capabilities but doesn't directly relate to the development of the group's own tools or the use of specific execution tools like Cobalt Strike.
   - **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or other capabilities that can be used for malicious purposes. Given that BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools and then used tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX, obtaining capabilities (either by developing them in-house or acquiring them) seems like a logical precursor to their employment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the employment of specific tools for execution.
   - The development of their own tools and the use of PRC-linked infrastructure suggest a focus on resource development and capability acquisition.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** most directly aligns with the preparatory phase of developing or acquiring tools before their use in execution.

Final Answer: D
