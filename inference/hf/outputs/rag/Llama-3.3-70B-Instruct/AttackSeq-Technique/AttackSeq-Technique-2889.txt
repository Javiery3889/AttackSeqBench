To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary has already used discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. Now, the focus is on establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols. This implies the adversary is looking to set up a command and control (C2) channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Command and Control, with a specific technique mentioned as T1071.001 - Web Protocols. This technique involves using application-layer protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS, for communication between the adversary and the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic, which could be part of establishing a C2 channel but doesn't directly relate to using HTTP and HTTPS protocols for the initial setup of communication.
   - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique is about causing a denial-of-service condition on a network, which does not align with establishing communication for C2 purposes.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This is the broader technique under which using web protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) falls. Given that T1071.001 (Web Protocols) is listed as a related TTP, this choice directly aligns with the described action of establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which, while potentially useful in various stages of an attack, does not directly relate to establishing C2 communication using web protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for establishing communication, which is a key aspect of setting up a C2 channel.
   - The related TTPs highlight the tactic of Command and Control and specifically mention the use of web protocols (T1071.001), which directly supports the use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - Among the answer choices, **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols, as it encompasses the use of web protocols for C2 communication.

Final Answer: C
