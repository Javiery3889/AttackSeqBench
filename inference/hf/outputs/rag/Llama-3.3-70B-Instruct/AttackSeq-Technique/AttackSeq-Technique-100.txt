To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has exploited known vulnerabilities using malicious documents. The goal now is to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to conceal the identity of the Command and Control (C2) server during communication. This implies the attacker is looking to hide or obscure the C2 server's identity to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This tactic and technique are about moving laterally within a network by exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services. While relevant for post-exploitation activities, it doesn't directly relate to concealing C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This involves disguising malware or malicious traffic to make it appear as something benign. It's about evasion but doesn't specifically address concealing the C2 server's identity during communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding to hide the content of communication. While it could be used for C2 communication, it's more about the encoding of the data rather than concealing the server's identity.
   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or execute files. It's not directly related to concealing the identity of a C2 server.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is about tricking users into revealing sensitive information. It's not directly related to concealing C2 server identities during communication.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which can be used to conceal the true destination (e.g., the C2 server) of the communication. This directly addresses the goal of hiding the C2 server's identity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 server, which implies a need to obscure or hide the destination of the communication.
   - Among the provided options, **T1090-Proxy** is the technique that directly addresses the need to conceal the identity of a C2 server by acting as an intermediary for the communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves using a proxy to hide the C2 server's identity.

Final Answer: D
