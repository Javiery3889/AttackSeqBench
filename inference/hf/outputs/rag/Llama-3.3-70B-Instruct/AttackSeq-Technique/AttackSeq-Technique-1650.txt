To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained initial access to a network by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8. The focus is on what technique is most likely used next to secure alternative means of access for maintaining control over the compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the initial access and persistence tactics. Specifically:
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is related to the initial access tactic, which aligns with the exploitation of the Internet Explorer vulnerability mentioned in the question.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts** is listed under both initial access and persistence tactics, indicating its versatility in both gaining access and maintaining presence within a network.
   
3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft** is not directly related to securing alternative means of access but rather to the exfiltration or theft of financial information, which doesn't fit the context of maintaining control.
   - **B: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** involves creating scheduled tasks to execute programs at a specific time or interval, which could be a method for maintaining persistence but doesn't directly relate to securing alternative access means.
   - **C: T1136-Create Account** involves creating new accounts on a system, which could be used to secure alternative means of access by providing the attackers with additional, potentially less visible, entry points.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information** is about tricking users into divulging sensitive information and doesn't directly relate to the post-exploitation phase of securing alternative access.

Given the context of needing to secure alternative means of access after initial exploitation, creating a new account (T1136) would provide attackers with a reliable method to maintain control over the compromised system without relying solely on the initial exploit, which could be patched or otherwise mitigated.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used after gaining initial access to secure alternative means of access.
   - The exploitation of a public-facing application (like the Internet Explorer vulnerability) is the initial access method.
   - Securing alternative access involves ensuring that even if the initial entry point is closed, the attackers can still get in.
   - Creating a new account (T1136) directly supports this goal by providing an additional, potentially more stable, means of accessing the system.

Final Answer: C
