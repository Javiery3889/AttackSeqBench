To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after a number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromised Japanese companies, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials have compromised various Japanese companies across different sectors. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to these companies' systems and are likely using the backdoors for further malicious activities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests that the attackers are using valid accounts to evade detection, possibly by blending in with normal network activity.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This indicates that valid accounts are being used to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This implies that the attackers are using multi-stage channels for command and control, which could involve the use of proxies or other intermediate steps to hide the true source of the commands.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A & C: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing input data, which could be relevant in certain scenarios but doesn't directly relate to the use of backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials for command and control purposes.
   - **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This is a sub-technique of Network Filtering and is less directly related to the scenario described, which focuses on command and control and evasion techniques rather than network filtering.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy**: Given the context of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials, using a proxy (T1090) seems highly relevant. Proxies can be used for command and control communications, helping to obscure the origin of the commands and making it harder to detect and block the malicious traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves second-stage backdoors, indicating that initial access has been achieved and the attackers are now focused on maintaining access and possibly evading detection.
   - The use of hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials in these backdoors points towards a method for command and control that aims to remain stealthy.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1090-Proxy** is the most directly related to the use of proxies for command and control purposes, which aligns with the scenario described.

Final Answer: D
