To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary, Infamous Chisel, is in the process of collecting files of interest from a local system. Before exfiltrating these files, the adversary needs to enumerate data directories and gather system information. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enables this enumeration and gathering of system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1074.001-Local Data Staging**. This technique involves staging locally collected data in a centralized location on the system, possibly in preparation for exfiltration.
   - **Tactic: Discovery**, with the technique **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**. This technique is about discovering files and directories on the system, which can be used to identify locations of interest for data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**. This technique involves stealing web cookies, which doesn't directly relate to enumerating local system directories or gathering system information for the purpose of collecting files.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is about using non-standard protocols for communication, which doesn't directly relate to the task of discovering files and directories on a local system.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**. This technique involves gathering information from cloud accounts, which is not relevant to the local system file and directory discovery.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**. This technique directly involves discovering local files and directories, which aligns with the need to enumerate data directories and gather system information before collecting and exfiltrating files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique that enables the enumeration of data directories and the gathering of system information before file exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of both collection and discovery tactics in the context of the attack.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is the technique that directly supports the action of enumerating data directories and gathering system information, which is necessary for collecting predefined files of interest.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** to facilitate the collection of files by first identifying where those files are located on the system.

Final Answer: D
