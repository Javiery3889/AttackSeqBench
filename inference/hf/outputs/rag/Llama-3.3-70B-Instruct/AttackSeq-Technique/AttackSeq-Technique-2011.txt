To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed on workstations, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware on workstations after employees enabled macros in weaponized phishing email attachments. This indicates a scenario where the initial access vector was through phishing, and the execution of the malware was facilitated by user interaction (enabling macros).

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing malicious files, which aligns with the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves gaining initial access to a system through spearphishing attachments, which matches the scenario of employees receiving and interacting with weaponized email attachments.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1569.001-Launchctl**: This technique is related to executing system commands via launchctl, which doesn't directly relate to the initial steps of executing malware from a phishing email.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This involves using shared modules, which might be relevant in some malware campaigns but doesn't directly precede the execution of malware from a phishing email.
   - **C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique is about discovering remote systems, which doesn't fit the scenario of executing malware after a phishing attack.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious content (like enabling macros in a document) by the user, which directly precedes the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware in the described scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario involves an initial access vector of spearphishing with attachments (T1566.001), leading to the execution of malicious content.
   - The key action that leads to the malware execution is the user enabling macros, which is a form of user execution.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed is related to the user's action of enabling macros, which aligns with **T1204-User Execution**.

Final Answer: D
