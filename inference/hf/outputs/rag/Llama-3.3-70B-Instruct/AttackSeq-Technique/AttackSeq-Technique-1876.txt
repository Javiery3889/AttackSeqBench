To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the initial access phase of an attack, specifically mentioning the exploitation of external servers and the use of web shells. This indicates we are looking for a technique that precedes or enables this initial access, particularly in the context of exploiting public-facing applications or services.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain initial access. This is directly relevant to the scenario described, as exploiting external servers could involve public-facing applications.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: Web shells are used for persistence and can be a result of initial access, allowing attackers to maintain a presence on the network. This technique is mentioned as part of the attack but is more about what happens after initial access is gained.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain initial access, which aligns with the exploitation of external servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs**: This involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for command and control (C2) communications, which might not directly precede the exploitation of external servers.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This is a technique related to persistence and privilege escalation, not directly related to the initial access phase described.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the victim network, which could happen after initial access is established, not necessarily before.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: Gathering information about the victim's network could be a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications or external remote services, as it helps in identifying potential entry points.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of exploiting external servers and leveraging web shells for initial access, the most logical precursor would be gathering information about the victim's network to identify vulnerabilities or potential entry points.
   - Techniques like T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) and T1133 (External Remote Services) are directly related to the initial access method described but are more about the action of exploiting rather than the preparation for it.
   - Therefore, gathering victim network information (T1590) would be a plausible step before attempting to exploit external servers, as it would provide necessary intelligence for a successful exploit.

Final Answer: D
