To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app, after hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7, is likely to use a specific ATT&CK technique to collect geo-location data from the device. The key detail here is the collection of geo-location data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with **Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**. This technique involves masquerading as a legitimate process or service to evade detection, which doesn't directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
   - **Tactic: Collection** with **Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**. This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could encompass a wide range of data types, including geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding** is related to encoding data to avoid detection, not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules** is related to authentication mechanisms, not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **C: T1614-System Location Discovery** directly involves collecting information about the system's location, which aligns with the goal of collecting geo-location data.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** involves identifying the owner or user of a system, which is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

Given the focus on collecting geo-location data, **T1614-System Location Discovery** is the most relevant technique. Although it's not listed in the "Related TTPs," it's the most directly related to the action described in the question among the provided answer choices.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to collect geo-location data.
   - The related TTPs provide context but do not directly answer the question.
   - Evaluating each answer choice, **T1614-System Location Discovery** is the technique that directly involves collecting system location information, which includes geo-location data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for collecting geo-location data after the described initial actions is **C: T1614-System Location Discovery**.

Final Answer: C
