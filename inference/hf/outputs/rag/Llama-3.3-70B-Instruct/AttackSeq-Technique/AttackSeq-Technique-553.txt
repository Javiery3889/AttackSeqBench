To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after initial compromise and redirection to phishing websites, the attackers aim to capture credentials. The focus is on the technique used to capture credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) log-in pages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing credentials by logging user input on web portals, which aligns with the scenario of using fake OWA log-in pages.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This involves gathering credentials as part of reconnaissance, which is broader and not specifically about capturing input on fake login pages.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing with a link to compromise targets, which is part of the initial stages of the attack but not directly related to capturing credentials on fake login pages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which does not directly relate to capturing credentials on fake login pages.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This is a broader technique that involves capturing user input, which could apply but is less specific than another option directly related to web portal capture.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography, which is not directly related to capturing credentials on fake login pages.
   - **D: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This involves trying many passwords against a single account, which is not about capturing credentials through fake login pages.

Given the context and the specific mention of capturing credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages, **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** is the most relevant technique. However, since this specific sub-technique is not listed among the answer choices, we look for the closest match. **T1056-Input Capture** is the broader category under which web portal capture falls, making it the most appropriate choice given the options.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about capturing credentials on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - The related TTPs highlight **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** as the most relevant technique for this action.
   - Since **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture** is not an answer choice, we select the broader technique it falls under, which is **T1056-Input Capture**.
   - **T1056-Input Capture** is the closest match to the described action of capturing credentials by logging victim input.

Final Answer: B
