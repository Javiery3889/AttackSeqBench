To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, before extensively using remote services for lateral movement, uses tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, and net user commands to understand the network environment. This implies the attacker is in a phase of gathering information about the network, which is a part of the discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1018-Remote System Discovery". This technique involves the attacker discovering remote systems, which aligns with the use of tools like Nmap and Nbtscan to map out the network environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1012-Query Registry (A)**: This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system. While it is a discovery technique, it is more focused on local system discovery rather than remote system discovery or understanding the broader network environment.
   - **T1021-Remote Services (B & C)**: This technique involves using remote services to interact with a system, which could be part of lateral movement but doesn't directly relate to the initial phase of discovering the network environment.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D)**: This technique is not directly mentioned in the provided context, but it involves using application layer protocols to communicate with systems. However, the question hints at a technique that occurs after initial network discovery and before extensive use of remote services for lateral movement.

Given the context of using tools to understand the network environment and the provided related TTPs, the most relevant technique that would occur after initial network discovery (using tools like Nmap, Nbtscan) and before using remote services extensively for lateral movement would indeed be related to discovering remote systems. However, the exact match from the provided choices that fits the sequence described (considering the use of compromised credentials and the context of moving towards lateral movement) seems to be slightly misaligned with the direct implications of the question.

Since **T1018-Remote System Discovery** is mentioned as a related TTP and the question asks for a technique that likely occurred after using tools to understand the network environment, and considering the options provided, **T1021-Remote Services** seems to be the closest in the context of moving towards using remote services for lateral movement after discovering the network. However, it's essential to note that the question's framing and the options provided don't perfectly align with the typical sequence of TTPs as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an initial phase of network discovery.
   - The use of Nmap, Nbtscan, and net user commands suggests a focus on understanding the network environment.
   - The related TTP **T1018-Remote System Discovery** supports this phase of discovery.
   - The question then implies a move towards using remote services for lateral movement.
   - Given the options and the context, **T1021-Remote Services** is the technique that would logically follow the initial discovery phase, especially as it pertains to the use of remote services for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
