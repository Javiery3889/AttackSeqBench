To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the attack used legitimate applications to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of legitimate applications to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers. This action is directly related to gaining access to the victim's credentials, which falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from web browsers, which aligns with the action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique is about setting up rules to forward emails, potentially to collect sensitive information or maintain access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon. While it's a method for persistence, it doesn't directly follow the action of collecting credentials from mail clients and browsers.
   - **B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**: This is a technique used for persistence and privilege escalation by hijacking dynamic libraries. It doesn't directly relate to the collection of credentials.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which could be a next step after collecting credentials from web browsers, as it also involves accessing stored credentials.
   - **D: T1552.003-Bash History**: This technique involves collecting command history from bash, which might not directly follow the action of collecting credentials from mail clients and browsers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes an action focused on collecting credentials.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under "Credential Access" and "Collection", indicating the attack's focus is on gathering sensitive information.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** is the most directly related to the action of collecting credentials, as it involves accessing stored credentials, which could be a subsequent step after collecting credentials from web browsers and mail clients.

**Final Answer: C**
