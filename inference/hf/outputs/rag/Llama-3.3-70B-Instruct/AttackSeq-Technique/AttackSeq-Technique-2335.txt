To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Cinobi, presumably malware, uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials. After this initial phase, it communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server over a Tor proxy to download additional malware stages and configuration files. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs during this communication.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (Tactic) and include techniques such as using a proxy (T1090) for communication. There's also a mention of browser session hijacking (T1185) under the Collection tactic, but the primary focus of the related TTPs is on Command and Control, specifically proxy usage.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**: This technique involves manipulating firmware to gain persistence or control. It doesn't directly relate to communicating with a C&C server over a proxy.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide or obscure the C&C server's location. Given that the question mentions communication over a Tor proxy, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing DNS entries to make it difficult to track the C&C server. While it's a method for obscuring C&C communications, the question specifically mentions using a Tor proxy, not DNS manipulation.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information. The scenario described involves post-exploitation activities (downloading additional malware), not initial access or phishing attempts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by Cinobi to interact with its C&C server after initial credential theft.
   - The use of a Tor proxy for this communication is highlighted, which aligns with techniques used for hiding the location of C&C servers.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1090-Proxy** directly relates to using a proxy for C&C communications, which matches the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using a proxy for Command and Control purposes.

Final Answer: B
