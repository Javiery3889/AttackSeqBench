To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and before installing the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistence. This implies we are looking for a technique that would logically precede the installation of a backdoor, possibly related to how the attackers utilized the obtained credentials.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This suggests the use of domain accounts for persistence, which aligns with the idea of using obtained credentials for further access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.006-DCSync**: This technique involves using the DCSync method to obtain credentials, which is related to how Mimikatz can be used.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which doesn't directly relate to the use of credentials for persistence or the actions immediately preceding backdoor installation.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts, which aligns with the use of domain administrator credentials obtained through Mimikatz. It's a plausible step after obtaining credentials and before installing a backdoor, as it would involve using those credentials for further access or actions.
   - **C: T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique involves exploiting accessibility features, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario of using obtained credentials for persistence.
   - **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves forging web credentials, which doesn't align with the use of domain administrator credentials obtained through Mimikatz for installing a backdoor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the actions taken after obtaining domain administrator credentials and before achieving persistence with the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The use of Mimikatz to obtain credentials suggests the attackers are interested in leveraging valid accounts for their purposes.
   - Among the provided options, **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most relevant to using obtained credentials for further access or to facilitate the installation of a backdoor.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves using valid accounts after obtaining the credentials.

Final Answer: B
