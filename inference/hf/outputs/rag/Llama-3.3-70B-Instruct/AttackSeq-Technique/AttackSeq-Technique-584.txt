To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained credential access using tools like Mimikatz and Impacket for pass-the-hash attacks. They then use webshells to dump credentials and execute commands on other systems within the network. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using a password hash to authenticate to a remote system without needing the actual password, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz and Impacket for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing credential material stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory, which can be done using tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.002-Security Account Manager**: This technique involves accessing credential material stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM), which can also be targeted by attackers to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection** is not directly related to the use of webshells, dumping credentials, or executing commands on other systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection** involves injecting code into a process, which could be a part of the attack but doesn't directly relate to the use of webshells for executing commands on other systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1021-Remote Services** involves using remote services to execute commands, which aligns with the scenario of using webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network after gaining credential access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1021.007-Cloud Services** is specific to using cloud services for command and control, which is not indicated in the scenario provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained credential access and are using webshells to execute commands on other systems.
   - The use of webshells for command execution on remote systems within the network best aligns with the technique of using remote services for lateral movement and command execution.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that matches this scenario is **T1021-Remote Services**, as it directly involves using remote services to execute commands on other systems, which is what the attackers are doing after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: C
