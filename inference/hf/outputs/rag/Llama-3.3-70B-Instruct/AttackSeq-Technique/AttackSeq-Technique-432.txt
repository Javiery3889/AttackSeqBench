To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the AutoIt downloader used WMI objects to perform reconnaissance and gather process lists during victim system discovery, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions an AutoIt downloader utilizing WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) objects for reconnaissance, specifically to gather process lists during victim system discovery. This implies the attacker is in the discovery phase, trying to understand the victim's system environment.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**. This technique involves the adversary trying to identify services running on the system.
   - **Tactic: Execution** with **Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**. This technique involves using WMI to execute commands or access system information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This involves identifying peripheral devices connected to the system, which might not directly follow the use of WMI for process list gathering.
   - **B: T1547.015-Login Items**: This technique is about adding an executable to a login item, which is more related to persistence than the immediate next step after system discovery.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns closely with the use of WMI for reconnaissance and could logically follow the initial system discovery activities.
   - **D: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This involves searching for open websites or domains, which seems unrelated to the immediate next steps after using WMI for system discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already used WMI for initial reconnaissance, indicating an interest in the system's configuration and running processes.
   - The next logical step would be to gather more detailed system information to understand the environment better, which aligns with **T1082-System Information Discovery**.
   - This technique is directly related to the discovery phase and would naturally follow the initial use of WMI for gathering process lists.

Final Answer: C
