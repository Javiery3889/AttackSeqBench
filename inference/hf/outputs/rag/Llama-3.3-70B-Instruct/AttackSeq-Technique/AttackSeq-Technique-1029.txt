To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically Gamaredon, has used a backdoor to list interesting files on a system during the discovery phase. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares after this initial discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are categorized under the "Collection" and "Discovery" tactics. Specifically, they include:
   - **T1039: Data from Network Shared Drive** under the Collection tactic, which involves collecting data from a network shared drive.
   - **T1005: Data from Local System** under the Collection tactic, which involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **T1083: File and Directory Discovery** under the Discovery tactic, which involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1596.002-WHOIS**: This technique is related to gathering information about a domain or IP address using WHOIS queries, which doesn't directly relate to collecting files or data from local systems, drives, or network shares.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting the trust of a system by manipulating its trust mechanisms, which doesn't directly relate to the collection of sensitive documents.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system, which aligns with the scenario of using a backdoor to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**: This option seems unrelated to the direct collection of files or data as described in the scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a backdoor for listing interesting files, indicating an automated process.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under the Collection tactic that involve gathering data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - Given the context of automated collection of sensitive documents, **T1119-Automated Collection** is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the automated gathering of data, which could include sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves the use of automated collection techniques to gather sensitive information.

Final Answer: C
