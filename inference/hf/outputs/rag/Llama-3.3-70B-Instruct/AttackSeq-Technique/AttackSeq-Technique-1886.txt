To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has staged data collected from network shared drives and archived it using specific utilities. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable the transfer of tools and communication within the network after this data staging.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This indicates the attacker is collecting and staging data remotely, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools within a network, which could be relevant to enabling further malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This shows the attacker is collecting data from shared drives, fitting the initial action described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question hints at the need for a technique that facilitates the transfer of tools and communication after data staging. 
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or to facilitate internal network communication. It could be used for transferring tools and communicating within the network.
   - **B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**: This technique is related to modifying or adding libraries to execute malicious code, which doesn't directly relate to transferring tools or communication.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to access a network, which could be relevant but is more about initial access or maintaining access rather than specifically transferring tools.
   - **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding infrastructure used for malicious activities, which doesn't directly enable tool transfer or communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question emphasizes the need for a technique that enables tool transfer and communication after data staging.
   - Given the related TTPs, **T1090-Proxy** stands out as it directly facilitates communication and could be used for transferring tools within the network, aligning with the need to enable further malicious activities after data staging.
   - **T1021-Remote Services** could be considered for accessing the network, but it's not as directly related to the specific action of transferring tools and enabling communication as **T1090-Proxy**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves using a proxy for communication and tool transfer.

Final Answer: A
