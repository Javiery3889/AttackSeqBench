To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware achieved persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry but before establishing command and control by injecting into a process through Process Hollowing, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of events in an attack. First, the malware achieves persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry. This is associated with the technique T1547, which involves boot or logon autostart execution. After achieving persistence, the malware needs to perform some action before it establishes command and control (C2) through process hollowing, which is a technique (T1055.012) used for defense evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This is how the malware plans to establish C2.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This is how the malware achieved persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the technique used for achieving persistence, which is already mentioned as the initial step in the question. Therefore, it's not what we're looking for as the next step.
   - **Option B and D: T1057-Process Discovery** seems to be a repeated option, but it's relevant because after achieving persistence and before establishing a C2 channel, the malware might need to discover which processes are running on the system to decide which one to hollow. This is a plausible step before process hollowing as it would help in selecting a suitable process for hollowing.
   - **Option C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** involves gathering information about the domain trusts of the target environment, which, while potentially useful for lateral movement or other phases of the attack, does not directly relate to the immediate need of establishing C2 through process hollowing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware first achieves persistence using a RunOnce key, which is associated with T1547.
   - Before it can establish C2 through process hollowing (T1055.012), it logically needs to identify a suitable process to hollow, which aligns with process discovery (T1057).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves process discovery after persistence is achieved and before attempting to establish C2.

Final Answer: B
