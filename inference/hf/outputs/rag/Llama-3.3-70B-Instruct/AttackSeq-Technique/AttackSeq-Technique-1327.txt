To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after using Discovery techniques to identify targeted files, gathers information from removable drives while skipping certain file types. This is attributed to the CosmicDuke malware. The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred during this process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the Discovery tactic, which includes:
   - **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering peripheral devices connected to a system.
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering files and directories on the system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1127.002-ClickOnce**: This technique involves using ClickOnce, a Microsoft technology, to execute code. It doesn't directly relate to gathering information from removable drives.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. It doesn't directly relate to the action of gathering information from removable drives.
   - **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which doesn't directly relate to the described action of gathering data from removable media.
   - **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives. This directly aligns with the scenario described, where CosmicDuke gathers information from removable drives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions gathering information from removable drives, which aligns with the Discovery tactic and the techniques related to discovering and interacting with peripheral devices and files.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **T1025-Data from Removable Media** is the technique that directly involves collecting data from removable media, which matches the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is related to collecting data from removable media.

Final Answer: D
