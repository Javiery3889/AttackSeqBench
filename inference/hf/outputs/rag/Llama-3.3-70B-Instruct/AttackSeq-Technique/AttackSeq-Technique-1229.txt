To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Inception attackers used anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process. Anti-forensics techniques are methods used by attackers to evade detection and hinder forensic analysis. This implies that the attackers are trying to cover their tracks, which aligns with the tactic of Defense Evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Defense Evasion and specifically mention the technique T1070-Indicator Removal and its sub-technique T1070.004-File Deletion. Indicator Removal involves removing or altering artifacts that could be used to detect the adversary, which is a direct consequence of using anti-forensics techniques.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions on executable installer files, which doesn't directly relate to the use of anti-forensics or the removal of indicators.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup**: This technique involves using the startup functionality of office applications to execute malicious code. While it's a method for persistence or execution, it doesn't directly follow the use of anti-forensics techniques.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: Given that the attackers used anti-forensics techniques to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry, this technique directly aligns with the actions described. It's about removing indicators of compromise, which is a natural step after attempting to cover tracks.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves undermining trust mechanisms such as digital certificates or code signing. While it's a method of defense evasion, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of using anti-forensics and then removing indicators.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the use of anti-forensics techniques, which are used to evade detection.
   - The related TTPs highlight Defense Evasion, specifically Indicator Removal (T1070) and its sub-technique File Deletion (T1070.004), indicating the focus is on removing evidence of the attack.
   - Among the answer choices, T1070-Indicator Removal (C) is the most directly related to the actions described in the question and the provided related TTPs.

Final Answer: C
