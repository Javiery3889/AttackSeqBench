To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) server, accessed via Server Message Block (SMB), to execute additional PowerShell scripts. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer exfiltrated data out of the network after this setup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the Exfiltration tactic and include:
   - **T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, which involves transferring data from the victim network to the attacker's system using the same channel used for command and control.
   - **T1048: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**, which involves using non-standard protocols for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A (T1078.004-Cloud Accounts)**: This technique involves using cloud services for command and control, but it doesn't directly relate to exfiltrating data out of the network using the described C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B (T1029-Scheduled Transfer)**: This technique is about transferring data to an attacker-controlled system at a scheduled time, which doesn't directly match the scenario of using an established C2 channel for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C (T1530-Data from Cloud Storage)**: This involves obtaining data from cloud storage services, which is not directly relevant to the exfiltration method described.
   - **Answer Choice D (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique directly matches the scenario described, where the attacker uses the established C2 channel (in this case, via Microsoft OneDrive accessed through SMB) for exfiltrating data out of the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions using Microsoft OneDrive as a C2 server to execute scripts, indicating an established channel for command and control.
   - The focus is on the method used for exfiltrating data after this setup, pointing towards using the existing C2 channel for data transfer.
   - Given the related TTPs and the specifics of the question, **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the most relevant technique as it directly involves using the command and control channel for exfiltrating data.
   
Final Answer: D
