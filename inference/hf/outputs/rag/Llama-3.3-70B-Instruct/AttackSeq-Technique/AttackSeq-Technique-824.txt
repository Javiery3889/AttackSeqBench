To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after transmitting credentials stolen through spearphishing emails to their Command and Control (C2) servers, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure. This implies we are looking for a technique related to maintaining anonymity or secure communication with the C2 servers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This suggests the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This indicates data exfiltration is happening over the established C2 channel.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This is how initial access was gained, through spearphishing.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique is about collecting information on the victim, which doesn't directly relate to anonymous communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: T1590.002-DNS**: This involves using DNS for C2 communication, which could be a method for anonymous communication but isn't the most direct method for ensuring anonymity in communication with C2 servers.
   - **C: T1090-Proxy**: Using a proxy can facilitate anonymous communication by hiding the actual IP address of the C2 server or the compromised host, making it a strong candidate for facilitating anonymous communication.
   - **D: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This is a technique used to hide a service by only making it accessible after a specific sequence of network requests, which doesn't directly facilitate anonymous communication in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of needing anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure after initial access and exfiltration, the technique must support hiding or masking the communication.
   - Among the options, **T1090-Proxy** stands out as it directly supports anonymous communication by acting as an intermediary, thus hiding the actual IP addresses involved in the communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for facilitating FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after transmitting stolen credentials would involve using a proxy.

Final Answer: C
