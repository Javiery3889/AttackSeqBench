To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the PlugX variant communicated with C2 domains using web services, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the communication of a PlugX variant with Command and Control (C2) domains over specific ports using HTTP. This indicates we are looking at a Command and Control (C2) tactic, specifically how the malware communicates back to its controllers.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control tactics. Specifically:
   - **T1071.001-Web Protocols** is a technique under the Application Layer Protocol subset, indicating the use of standard web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port** refers to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication, which can be used to evade detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure used for C2, which could include using non-standard ports or web services to blend in with legitimate traffic. However, it's more about concealing the infrastructure rather than the method of communication itself.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This is a broader technique that involves using web services for C2 communication but doesn't specifically address the preparation or setup for such communication.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This sub-technique under Web Service is about establishing bidirectional communication, which is relevant but doesn't directly imply the setup or preparation for the communication method described.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, which could be a part of the C2 process but doesn't directly relate to setting up the communication channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **before** the communication with C2 domains. This implies we're looking for a technique that sets the stage for or enables this communication.
   - Given the context of using web services over specific ports, the focus should be on techniques that facilitate or are directly related to establishing this form of C2 communication.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure (A)** is about making the C2 infrastructure less detectable, which could involve setting up communication channels to use non-standard ports or blend in with legitimate web traffic, making it a plausible precursor to the described communication method.

**Final Answer: A**
