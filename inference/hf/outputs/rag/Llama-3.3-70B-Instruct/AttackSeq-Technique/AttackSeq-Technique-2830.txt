To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where BlackSoul has established communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. This communication is facilitated by the RESTful Strapi protocol and uses JSON-based data encoding. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next for transferring data over the established C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This indicates that the attacker is likely interested in extracting data from the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the technique **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**. This suggests the use of non-standard protocols for C2 communication, which could be relevant but does not directly address data transfer methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**: This technique involves creating a forged Kerberos ticket to access systems without being detected. It does not directly relate to data transfer over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data using a symmetric encryption algorithm over a non-C2 protocol, which does not match the scenario of using an established C2 channel for data transfer.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data, which could be a part of the process but does not specifically address the method of data transfer over the C2 channel.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique is about archiving the data collected from the target, which is not directly related to the transfer of data over the C2 channel.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most relevant technique for transferring data over the established C2 channel is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. However, this option is not directly listed in the answer choices. Among the provided options, **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the closest in context to the action of transferring data, as it implies the movement of data, even though it doesn't specifically mention the use of a C2 channel. However, based on the information given and the focus on C2 channel communication, none of the provided choices perfectly match the described scenario of using the C2 channel for data transfer as closely as **T1041** would, but since we must choose from the given options and considering the closest relevance to data transfer:

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the establishment of a C2 channel and asks about data transfer over this channel.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration and C2 communication tactics.
   - Given the choices, **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the closest to involving data movement, even though it's not a perfect match for the scenario described, which would ideally involve **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

**Final Answer: C**
