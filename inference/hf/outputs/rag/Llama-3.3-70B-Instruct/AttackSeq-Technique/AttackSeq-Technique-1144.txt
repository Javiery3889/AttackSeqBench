To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after GroundPeony utilized spear-phishing emails with lure documents and URL obfuscation to distribute malicious payloads from compromised websites, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial access tactic using spear-phishing emails with specific techniques such as lure documents and URL obfuscation. This already points towards techniques related to initial access and possibly execution or persistence, given the context of distributing malicious payloads.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Initial Access and include Phishing (T1566) and Spearphishing Link (T1566.002). These are directly related to the initial stage of an attack, where the attacker attempts to gain access to a system or network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves spear-phishing that is targeted at people within the organization, which might not directly follow the initial access via external spear-phishing.
   - **B: T1059.004-Unix Shell**: This involves using a Unix shell to execute commands, which could be a step after initial access but is more specific to the type of system being targeted.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Given that the initial attack vector involved URL obfuscation, it's plausible that the attackers would also use obfuscated files or information to evade detection after gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which could be a step after initial access to execute malicious payloads.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial attack vector is spear-phishing with URL obfuscation, indicating a focus on evading detection and successfully delivering a malicious payload.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical steps would involve executing the malicious payload and potentially maintaining access or moving laterally within the network.
   - Techniques like T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) and T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) are both plausible next steps as they involve executing or hiding malicious activities.
   - However, given the emphasis on obfuscation in the initial attack, **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** seems like a particularly relevant next step as it aligns with the attackers' apparent interest in evading detection.

**Final Answer: C**
