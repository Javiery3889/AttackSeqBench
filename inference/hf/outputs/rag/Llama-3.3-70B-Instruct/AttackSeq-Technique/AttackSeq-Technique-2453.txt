To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access stage but before persistence was achieved, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial Access Stage**: The victims were redirected to download a ZIP file containing a malicious executable. This indicates that the initial access has been achieved, likely through phishing or some form of social engineering (though the specific initial access technique isn't the focus of the question).

2. **Before Persistence**: The question specifies that persistence was achieved by creating registry keys in `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. This is directly related to the technique `T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder`, which is listed under the Persistence tactic.

3. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim. While it could be part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of achieving persistence through registry modifications.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or detect. Given that a malicious executable was downloaded, it's plausible that the executable or its communication could be obfuscated to evade detection, which could happen after initial access and before establishing persistence.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. This could potentially be used after initial access to prepare for persistence, such as executing scripts that eventually lead to modifying registry keys for persistence.
   - **D: T1059.002-AppleScript**: This is a sub-technique of `T1059` specifically related to AppleScript on macOS systems. Given the context of modifying Windows registry keys, this seems less relevant.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Considering the need for an action that bridges the initial access (downloading a malicious executable) and the establishment of persistence (modifying registry keys), the most plausible techniques would facilitate either the execution of the malicious code in a way that evades detection or the preparation of the system for persistence.

Given the context, **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** seems like a strong candidate because the malicious executable might need to be obfuscated to avoid detection as it executes and before it establishes persistence. However, **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** could also be relevant as it directly involves executing commands or scripts, which could be necessary for creating the registry keys for persistence.

Between these two, **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** is more directly related to the actions that would occur immediately after initial access and before persistence mechanisms are put in place, as it would be crucial for the malware to remain undetected during its initial execution and setup.

**Final Answer: B**
