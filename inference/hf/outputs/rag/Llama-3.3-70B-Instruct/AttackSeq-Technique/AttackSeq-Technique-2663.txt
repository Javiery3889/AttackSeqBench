To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after collecting data and gathering system information, needs to facilitate encrypted communication with fallback Command and Control (C&C) servers. This implies the attacker is looking to establish a secure and possibly covert channel for further interaction with the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network configuration, which could include IP addresses and system locale, aligning with the initial actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which matches the action of collecting data from local and networked drives mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique is about using fallback or alternative C&C channels, which directly relates to the need for encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers as described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system, allowing for bidirectional communication. While it's relevant for C&C, it doesn't specifically address the fallback or encrypted aspect.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**: This involves hiding data within other data, which could be a method for covert communication but doesn't directly address the need for fallback C&C communication.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique is more about collecting data and doesn't directly relate to establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C&C communication, which could include encrypted communication and could be used for fallback channels, especially if the primary method is compromised.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question emphasizes the need for encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers after initial data collection and system information gathering.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of system discovery, local system data collection, and the use of fallback channels for C&C.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to facilitating encrypted communication, as it can involve using protocols that support encryption (like HTTPS) for C&C communication, which can serve as a fallback method.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for facilitating encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers would involve using application layer protocols that can support encryption.

Final Answer: D
