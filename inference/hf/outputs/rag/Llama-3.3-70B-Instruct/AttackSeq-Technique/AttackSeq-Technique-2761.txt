To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the SOCKSBOT implant used defense evasion methods, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of defense evasion methods by the SOCKSBOT implant, specifically reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe to avoid disk artifacts. This implies the attacker is trying to remain stealthy and avoid detection by not leaving traces on the disk.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the tactic of Defense Evasion, which aligns with the context of the question. The techniques mentioned include:
   - T1620: Reflective Code Loading, which is directly mentioned in the question as a method used by the SOCKSBOT implant.
   - T1055.001: Dynamic-link Library Injection, a form of process injection.
   - T1055: Process Injection, a broader category that includes injecting code into another process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the defense evasion methods described.
   - **B: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This involves using asymmetric cryptography for obfuscation or evasion. It's a bit more related to evasion but doesn't directly follow from the described use of reflective loading.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. Given that the implant has already evaded defenses by loading reflectively, using a command and scripting interpreter could be a next step to execute further commands or scripts without leaving additional disk artifacts.
   - **D: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**: This technique involves wiping disk structures, which seems unrelated to the immediate next steps after evading detection through reflective loading.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the use of defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - The related TTPs all fall under defense evasion, indicating the attacker's focus on remaining stealthy.
   - Among the answer choices, **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** seems the most plausible next step after successfully evading defenses. This is because, having avoided detection, the attacker might use command and scripting interpreters to execute further malicious actions without needing to drop additional files to disk, thus maintaining stealth.

Final Answer: C
