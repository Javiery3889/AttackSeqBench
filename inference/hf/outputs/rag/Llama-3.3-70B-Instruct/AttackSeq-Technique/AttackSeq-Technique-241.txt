To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where encryption and mimicking legitimate network traffic are used to evade defenses. It specifically asks about the technique that facilitated communication between malware and a command and control (C2) server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include a tactic of Command and Control and a technique of T1071.001-Web Protocols. This suggests that the communication between the malware and the C2 server involves web protocols, which aligns with using HTTP for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft**: This option does not directly relate to the method of communication between malware and a C2 server. It's more about the objective of the attack rather than the technique used for communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This option directly relates to using application layer protocols for communication, which includes HTTP. Given that the question specifies the use of HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string for communication, this option seems highly relevant.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: While encryption is mentioned in the question, this option focuses on the type of cryptography used rather than the method of communication itself.
   - **D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This option involves using malicious links, which does not directly relate to the establishment of communication between malware and a C2 server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question emphasizes the use of HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string for communication between malware and a C2 server.
   - The related TTPs highlight Command and Control as the tactic and Web Protocols as the technique, which aligns with using HTTP for communication.
   - Among the answer choices, **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant because it directly pertains to the use of application layer protocols like HTTP for communication purposes.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely facilitated the described communication is related to using application layer protocols.

Final Answer: B
