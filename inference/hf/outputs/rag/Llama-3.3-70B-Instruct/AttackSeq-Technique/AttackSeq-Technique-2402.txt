To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a victim is tricked into interacting with a malicious link, leading to the installation of trojanized files. The focus is on the technique that enables the removal of attack artifacts through a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'. This implies we are looking for a technique related to executing scripts or commands that can facilitate the removal of files or artifacts left behind by an attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Defense Evasion, specifically techniques T1070 (Indicator Removal) and T1070.004 (File Deletion). These techniques are about removing evidence of an attack to evade detection. The question hints at a similar goal with the 'DeleteLeftovers' script.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. It's a broad technique that could be used for various purposes, including executing a script like 'DeleteLeftovers' to remove attack artifacts.
   - **B: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This technique is about creating accounts that can be used for persistence or other malicious activities. It doesn't directly relate to executing scripts for removing attack artifacts.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about transferring data from a victim system to an attacker-controlled system. While important for data theft, it doesn't directly relate to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This is a sub-technique of T1059, specifically involving the use of the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. Given that 'DeleteLeftovers' is a script, using a Windows Command Shell could be a plausible way to execute such a script for removing files or artifacts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the execution of a script ('DeleteLeftovers') aimed at removing attack artifacts, which aligns with Defense Evasion tactics.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under Defense Evasion, specifically file deletion.
   - Between the answer choices, **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** and **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell** are the most relevant because they involve executing commands or scripts, which could include the 'DeleteLeftovers' script.
   - Given the specificity of the action (executing a script to remove leftovers), and considering the provided related TTPs focus on file deletion as a method of indicator removal, **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell** seems more directly related to the action of executing a script like 'DeleteLeftovers' on a Windows system.

Final Answer: D
