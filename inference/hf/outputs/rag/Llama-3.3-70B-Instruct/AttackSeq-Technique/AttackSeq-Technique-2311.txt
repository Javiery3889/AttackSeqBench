To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used lateral movement techniques (such as SMB and PsExec) to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons across compromised systems. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather information from platforms like Microsoft SharePoint Online before exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to laterally move across a network, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools across a network, which could be relevant to deploying Cobalt Strike beacons.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint**: This specifically mentions collecting data from SharePoint, which directly relates to gathering information from Microsoft SharePoint Online as mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This is a broader technique that involves collecting data from various information repositories, which could include SharePoint but is not as specific as another option.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1213.003-Code Repositories**: This involves collecting data from code repositories, which does not directly relate to the scenario of gathering information from SharePoint Online.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546.011-Application Shimming**: This technique involves intercepting and modifying API calls, which does not directly relate to the described scenario of gathering information from SharePoint.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts to access systems, which, while potentially part of the attack chain, does not specifically address the action of gathering information from SharePoint.

Given the specific mention of SharePoint in the question and among the related TTPs, the most relevant technique for gathering information from Microsoft SharePoint Online before exfiltration would be directly related to collecting data from SharePoint.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of lateral movement to deploy beacons and then gather information from SharePoint Online.
   - The related TTPs highlight lateral movement techniques and specifically mention collecting data from SharePoint (T1213.002-Sharepoint).
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for gathering information from SharePoint, as described, would be the one that directly involves collecting data from such platforms.
   - Therefore, the correct answer choice should directly relate to collecting data from information repositories, specifically SharePoint.

**Final Answer: A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
