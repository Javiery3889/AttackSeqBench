To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where iOS malware has collected sensitive device information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) and is looking for the most likely ATT&CK technique to transmit this data back to its operators. This implies we are looking for a technique related to data exfiltration or communication with the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided related TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't directly relate to transmitting collected data back to operators.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This is about collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial action described in the question (collecting device information) but not with the transmission of this data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication. It's plausible for transmitting collected data.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel could be used to protect the data in transit, making it a strong candidate for securely transmitting collected data back to operators.
   - **C: T1557.004-Evil Twin**: This involves creating a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one, which doesn't directly relate to the transmission of collected data from a compromised device.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code, which doesn't fit the scenario of transmitting collected data.

Given the context, the most relevant techniques for transmitting data collected by malware would involve communication with a C2 server. Between options A and B, **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** is particularly relevant because it specifically addresses the need to securely transmit data, which is a common practice to evade detection and protect the integrity of the exfiltrated data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used to transmit collected data to operators.
   - The related TTPs provide context but don't directly answer the question; they hint at collection and lateral movement, which are not the focus.
   - The answer choices require evaluating which technique is most suitable for data transmission.
   - Given the need for secure communication to transmit sensitive data without detection, establishing an encrypted channel stands out.

Final Answer: B
