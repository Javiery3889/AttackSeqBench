To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an APT group, after gathering system information and collecting files, screenshots, and metadata, needs to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server. This communication is for the purpose of receiving commands and sending stolen data. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to facilitate this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1005-Data from Local System**, which involves collecting data from the local system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**, which involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel.
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1113-Screen Capture**, which involves capturing screenshots.

   These TTPs indicate activities related to collecting data from the victim's system and exfiltrating it, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** is relevant to the activities of gathering system information, collecting files, and screenshots. However, it doesn't directly address the communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation** is not directly related to the communication with a C&C server or the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery** involves gaining knowledge about the system and its environment, which is not the primary focus of communicating with a C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** directly involves establishing communication with a C&C server for receiving commands and potentially sending stolen data, which aligns with the need to facilitate communication for these purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes activities that have already involved data collection (gathering system information, collecting files, and screenshots).
   - The primary goal now is to communicate with the C&C server, which is essential for both receiving further commands and exfiltrating the collected data.
   - The ATT&CK tactic that directly supports this goal is **Command and Control**, as it involves the communication necessary for receiving commands and potentially sending stolen data back to the attackers.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for facilitating communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data is aligned with **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**.

Final Answer: D
