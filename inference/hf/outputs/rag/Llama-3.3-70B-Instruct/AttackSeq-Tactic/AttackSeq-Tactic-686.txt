To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that attackers have already gained initial access to the network (as they have infected servers) and are now using these servers as a pivot point to spread manually across the network. This implies movement within the network after the initial breach.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network. It's a method used after initial access has been gained.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools within a network to facilitate lateral movement, which is also a post-initial access activity.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique is related to gaining initial access to a network, which is not the focus of the question since the attackers have already infected servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access** is incorrect because the question states that the attackers have already infected servers, indicating they have already achieved initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** could be a part of the attack process but doesn't directly relate to the action of spreading across the network after initial infection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** is crucial for remote control of the infected systems but doesn't directly describe the act of moving across the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement** directly corresponds with the action described in the question: using infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network. The related TTPs (T1021.002 and T1570) also support this tactic as they are techniques used for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers are moving within a network after gaining initial access.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques used for lateral movement within a network.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that aligns with the scenario described is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: B
