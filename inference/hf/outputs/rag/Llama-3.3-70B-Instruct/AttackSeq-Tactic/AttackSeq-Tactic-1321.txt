To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Earth Wendigo gained initial access, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: Earth Wendigo used obfuscated JavaScript in spear-phishing emails to load malicious scripts from a remote server and steal browser cookies. This action describes the initial access phase where the attacker uses social engineering (spear-phishing) to trick victims into executing malicious code.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This confirms the use of spear-phishing as a method for initial access.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This indicates that after gaining access, the attacker's goal is to steal web session cookies, which falls under credential access. Stealing web session cookies can be used for further malicious activities, such as accessing sensitive information or moving laterally within a network without needing additional credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A: Persistence**: While persistence is a crucial aspect of maintaining access, the question describes actions taken immediately after initial access, focusing on stealing browser cookies, which doesn't directly imply establishing persistence mechanisms.
   - **Option B: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving through a network to find and exploit additional resources. While stealing web session cookies could facilitate lateral movement, the immediate action described (stealing cookies) is more directly related to gaining access to credentials or sensitive information rather than the act of moving through the network.
   - **Option C: Execution**: Execution refers to the tactic of running malicious code on a victim's system. Given that the malicious scripts were loaded from a remote server and executed on the victim's system to steal browser cookies, this option seems closely related to the actions described immediately after initial access.
   - **Option D: Initial Access**: This option is what Earth Wendigo has already achieved by using spear-phishing emails, so it's not what happened after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines the initial access method used by Earth Wendigo.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of spear-phishing for initial access and the stealing of web session cookies for credential access.
   - Given that the malicious scripts were executed to steal browser cookies, the most direct next step after gaining initial access is the execution of these scripts to achieve the goal of stealing cookies, which aligns with the tactic of **Execution**.

Final Answer: C
