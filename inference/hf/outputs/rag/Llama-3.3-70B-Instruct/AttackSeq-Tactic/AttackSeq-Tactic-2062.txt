To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Hi-Zor RAT (Remote Access Trojan) using specific techniques such as string-stacking and double XOR encoding for its operations. After these operations, it sends a victim's Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the encoding operations but before the data exfiltration.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This indicates the use of standard encoding schemes for communication, which aligns with the use of double XOR encoding by the Hi-Zor RAT.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This suggests the use of encryption or encoding to evade detection, which aligns with the string-stacking and encoding operations mentioned.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the command and control server. Given that the Hi-Zor RAT used encoding for its operations, it's plausible that this encoding is part of establishing or maintaining command and control, especially since it's followed by sending information through a secure TLS connection.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on a system. While encoding could be used in various phases of an attack, there's no direct indication in the question that privilege escalation occurred after the encoding operations and before the data exfiltration.
   - **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves evading detection by security systems. The use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding could indeed be part of defense evasion techniques. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after these operations, suggesting we're looking for what happened next in the attack sequence, not the evasion itself.
   - **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves developing resources, such as creating new tools or infrastructure, to support the attack. There's no clear connection between the encoding operations and resource development in the provided context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Hi-Zor RAT's use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding suggests efforts to evade detection or communicate securely, aligning with Defense Evasion and Command and Control tactics, respectively.
   - Given that the question specifies these operations occurred before sending a victim's information through a secure TLS connection, it implies that the communication channel was already established or was being utilized for command and control purposes.
   - The most direct connection to sending information (in this case, the Volume Serial Number) through a secure connection is the Command and Control tactic, as it involves the communication between the malware and the command and control server.

Final Answer: A
