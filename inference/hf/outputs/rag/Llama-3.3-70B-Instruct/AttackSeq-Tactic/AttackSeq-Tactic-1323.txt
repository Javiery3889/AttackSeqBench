To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies, but before they intercepted HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Earth Wendigo, involving the manipulation of webmail session keys and browser cookies, followed by the interception of HTTPS POST requests to steal login credentials. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely fits between these actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This indicates that the attackers are focusing on gaining access to credentials, specifically through stealing web session cookies, which aligns with the initial action of manipulating webmail session keys and browser cookies.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking**: This tactic and technique suggest that the attackers are collecting sensitive information by hijacking browser sessions, which could involve intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves evading detection by security controls, which doesn't directly relate to the actions of manipulating session keys/cookies or intercepting HTTPS requests for credential theft.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to a system or network, which seems too early in the attack sequence given that the attackers are already manipulating session keys and cookies.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system or network, which might not directly align with the immediate goal of stealing credentials through session manipulation and HTTPS interception.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**: This tactic is about gathering information that can be used for future operations, such as credentials. Given that the attackers are manipulating session keys/cookies (which could be part of gaining access) and then looking to intercept HTTPS requests (to collect credentials), this tactic fits well as it directly involves collecting sensitive information like login credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies, which can be seen as part of gaining **Credential Access**.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, before intercepting HTTPS POST requests, would be to **collect** sensitive information, which in this context is the webmail login credentials.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial manipulation but before the interception of HTTPS requests is **Collection**, as it directly relates to gathering credentials through session hijacking or similar means.

Final Answer: D
