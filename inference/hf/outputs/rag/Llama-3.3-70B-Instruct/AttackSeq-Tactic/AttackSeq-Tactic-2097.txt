To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of a back door (Nidiran) and other hacktools to infect internal hosts. This implies that the attackers already have some level of access to the victim's network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Lateral Movement (Tactic) with T1080 (Technique: Taint Shared Content)**: This suggests movement within the network, potentially spreading malware or compromising additional systems by tainting shared content.
   - **Initial Access (Tactic) with T1189 (Technique: Drive-by Compromise)**: This indicates how an attacker might initially gain access to a network, possibly through a drive-by download or exploit of a user's browser.
   - **Credential Access (Tactic) with T1003 (Technique: OS Credential Dumping)**: This involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which could be used for further access or movement within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which could be part of the attack but doesn't necessarily precede the use of a back door.
   - **Option B: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control is crucial for remote control of compromised systems but typically follows initial access.
   - **Option C: Initial Access**: This is the most likely tactic to have occurred before using a back door. Initial access tactics provide the entry point into the network, after which tools like back doors can be deployed.
   - **Option D: Discovery**: While discovery is an important phase for attackers to understand the network layout and identify targets, it is not the most direct precursor to using a back door to infect internal hosts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of a back door like Nidiran implies that the attackers have already gained some form of access to the network.
   - The related TTPs suggest methods for gaining initial access (Drive-by Compromise) and moving laterally within the network.
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic most likely to have occurred **before** the use of the back door, we need to identify the tactic that would enable the initial entry into the network.
   - **Initial Access** is the tactic that directly precedes the ability to use a back door or other hacktools to infect internal hosts, as it provides the necessary entry point into the network.

Final Answer: C
