To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection and before using publicly available offensive security tools for target mapping and reconnaissance, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after evading detection by interfering with logging mechanisms, TG1021 used tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit. These tools are typically used for mapping and reconnaissance within a network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This indicates that the adversary is interested in discovering systems and services within the network, which aligns with the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This shows that the adversary is taking steps to evade detection, which includes interfering with logging mechanisms as mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems, which doesn't directly relate to the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Credential Access (B)**: While credential access is a crucial step in many attacks, the question specifically mentions the use of tools for target mapping and reconnaissance, not directly for obtaining credentials.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic directly aligns with the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for mapping and reconnaissance purposes. After evading detection, an adversary would likely want to understand the network layout and discover potential targets.
   - **Persistence (D)**: Persistence involves maintaining access to a system, which, while important, does not directly relate to the reconnaissance activities described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary first evades detection by interfering with logging mechanisms.
   - The next logical step, given the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit, is to perform **Discovery (C)** to understand the network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the Discovery tactic after defense evasion and before or as part of using specific tools for target mapping and reconnaissance.

Final Answer: C
