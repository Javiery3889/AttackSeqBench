To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Pierogi backdoor has already collected system information during the Discovery phase. It then utilizes its capabilities to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Discovery phase, given these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the Discovery tactic, specifically:
   - **T1057: Process Discovery** and **T1082: System Information Discovery**, which are techniques used to gather information about the system and its processes.
   - **T1113: Screen Capture** is a technique under the Collection tactic, used to capture screenshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the backdoor has already completed the Discovery phase by collecting system information. This aligns with techniques like **T1057** and **T1082**.
   - The actions of taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands indicate a progression beyond mere discovery. Taking screenshots directly aligns with **T1113: Screen Capture**, which is under the Collection tactic. Executing arbitrary commands can be related to several tactics but, in the context of utilizing backdoor capabilities after initial discovery, it suggests the adversary is now collecting more specific data or interacting with the system in a more targeted manner, which can also be part of the Collection tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Discovery phase has been completed as per the question, so **B: Discovery** is not the next likely tactic.
   - **C: Resource Development** is not directly related to the actions described (taking screenshots and executing commands).
   - **A: Command and Control** is relevant because executing arbitrary commands is a form of command and control, but the question specifically asks for the tactic most likely occurred as the backdoor utilized its capabilities to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands, and taking screenshots is directly related to **T1113: Screen Capture**, which falls under the Collection tactic.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **D: Collection**, as it encompasses the action of taking screenshots (**T1113: Screen Capture**) and can include executing commands to collect more information or interact with the system for data collection purposes.

Final Answer: D
