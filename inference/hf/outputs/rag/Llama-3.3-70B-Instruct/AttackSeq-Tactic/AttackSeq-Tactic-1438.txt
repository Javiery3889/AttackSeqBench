To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials and redirect users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The scenario involves the use of fictitious login sites to collect credentials. This action is followed by redirecting users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona. The primary goal here seems to be the collection of credentials, which is a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts**: This indicates the attacker's effort to compromise accounts, which aligns with the use of fictitious login sites to collect credentials.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This suggests that the attacker is gathering information, specifically credentials, which is consistent with the initial action of collecting credentials.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This implies the creation of accounts that could be used for various malicious purposes, including the establishment of personas or accounts used in phishing campaigns.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to credentials. Given that credentials were collected, the next logical step would involve using these credentials to access systems, data, or applications, which aligns with Credential Access.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic is about gaining knowledge of the target environment. While discovery might occur at some point, it doesn't directly follow the action of collecting credentials and redirecting to a YouTube clip as a primary next step.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This involves techniques used to evade detection. While defense evasion is crucial for attackers, the scenario described doesn't directly imply evasion techniques as the immediate next step after collecting credentials.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing communication channels for controlling compromised systems. It might be a later step after gaining access, but it doesn't directly follow the credential collection in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of fictitious login sites to collect credentials indicates an attempt to compromise accounts (T1586).
   - Redirecting users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona could be part of the social engineering tactic to make the phishing attempt seem more legitimate or to distract.
   - Given the context of collecting credentials, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to use those credentials to gain access to systems, data, or applications, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

Final Answer: A
