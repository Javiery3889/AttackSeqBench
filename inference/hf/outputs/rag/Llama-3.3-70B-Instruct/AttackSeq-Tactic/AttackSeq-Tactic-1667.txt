To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already gained access to a system, using credential-stealing modules and monitoring network traffic. The focus is on what tactic is most likely used next to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access** with **Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**, which involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gain information about the system or credentials.
   - **Tactic: Discovery** with **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**, which involves techniques used to discover information about running processes on a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** refers to the tactic of gathering information relevant to the target. While collection does involve gathering data, the specific focus on locating processes and memory utilization suggests a more targeted goal.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** directly aligns with the goal of locating processes and understanding system details. The technique T1057-Process Discovery falls under this tactic, which is about discovering information about the system, including running processes.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** is more about gathering information about the target system or network before accessing it, which doesn't fit the scenario since the attacker has already gained access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access** refers to the tactic used to initially gain access to a system, which is not relevant to the scenario described as the attacker has already accessed the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already gained access to the system and is looking to understand the system's processes and memory utilization.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of network sniffing for credential access and process discovery for system understanding.
   - Given the focus on locating processes and memory utilization, the most relevant tactic is **Discovery**, as it directly involves techniques like process discovery to understand the system's current state.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.

Final Answer: B
