To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application and before an automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where malware has been delivered through a proprietary hardware/software scanner application. This implies that the initial access vector has already been exploited, and the malware is now embedded within the system. The question then asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before an automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers. This indicates we are looking for a step in the attack sequence that precedes lateral movement or the use of the SMB protocol for attacking servers.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This suggests that the attackers used SMB to move laterally within the network, targeting servers. This is relevant to understanding the post-exploitation activities.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This indicates that the attackers used Visual Basic for execution, possibly for running scripts or payloads. This is a technique used after initial access has been gained.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This shows that embedded payloads were used, which aligns with the delivery of malware through a proprietary application. This technique is about evading detection.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - Given that the malware is already delivered and embedded, **Initial Access (C)** has already occurred, so it's not the correct answer.
   - **Exfiltration (B)** typically involves stealing data, which is not directly implied in the scenario leading up to an automated attack on servers using SMB.
   - **Execution (D)** is a strong candidate because after the malware is delivered, it needs to be executed to perform its intended functions, which could include setting up for lateral movement or automated attacks.
   - **Persistence (A)** is about maintaining access, which could be a part of the attack sequence but doesn't directly lead into an automated attack using SMB.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware has been delivered and is embedded.
   - For the malware to act (e.g., to prepare for or execute an automated attack), it must be **executed**.
   - Execution enables the malware to perform its functions, which could include setting the stage for lateral movement or direct attacks on servers via SMB.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after the delivery of the malware, **Execution** occurs to enable the malware's capabilities, which then can lead to an automated attack using the SMB protocol.

Final Answer: D
