To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used defense evasion techniques, specifically mentioning self-deletion based on a hardcoded date. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely involved in gathering detailed information such as IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings after such an action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the tactic of Defense Evasion, with techniques including file deletion (T1070.004) and execution guardrails (T1480). These techniques are used to evade detection and defenses but do not directly relate to gathering information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to evade detection, which aligns with the initial part of the question but does not directly involve gathering detailed system or network information.
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment. Techniques under Discovery could include gathering IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings, which matches the second part of the question.
   - **Persistence (C)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network, which does not directly relate to the action of gathering detailed information as described.
   - **Reconnaissance (D)**: While reconnaissance does involve gathering information, in the context of ATT&CK, it's more about gathering information outside the network or system before an intrusion. The question implies actions taken after employing defense evasion techniques, suggesting an internal or post-compromise phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an action (defense evasion) and then asks about gathering detailed system information.
   - The related TTPs focus on defense evasion but do not directly address information gathering.
   - Given the context, the most relevant tactic for gathering detailed information such as IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings after employing defense evasion techniques would be **Discovery**.
   - This is because Discovery directly involves techniques for gathering information about the target system or network, which aligns with the described actions of gathering IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings.

Final Answer: A
