To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after using standard communication protocols (FTP and HTTP) for command and control (C2) and implementing fallback channels, is looking to perform an action that follows the utilization of these channels. The key elements here are the use of standard ports for C2 communication and the implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This indicates the act of transferring data from a network without authorization, using the command and control channel.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the technique **T1008-Fallback Channels**. This involves establishing an alternate method for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system if the primary method is disrupted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**. This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or data. While credential access might be necessary for initial compromise or movement, it doesn't directly relate to the use of C2 channels or exfiltration methods described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**. Given that the question mentions "document exfiltration" and the use of fallback channels for this purpose, this tactic directly aligns with the described actions. Exfiltration is the act of transferring data from a system without authorization, which matches the context of using C2 channels for data transfer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**. This tactic involves evading detection by security controls. While using standard ports and fallback channels could be part of defense evasion, the primary focus of the question is on the action following the establishment of these channels, which is more directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**. This tactic is about establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The question does describe the use of C2 channels but asks for the tactic that "most likely followed" after these channels were utilized, indicating the action that comes after establishing command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines the use of standard ports for C2 communication and the implementation of fallback channels specifically for document exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration over C2 channels and the use of fallback channels, both of which are directly related to the act of exfiltrating data.
   - Given the context, the most logical next step after establishing command and control and implementing fallback channels for exfiltration purposes is the actual act of exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: B
