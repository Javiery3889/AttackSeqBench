To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server and used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the establishment of communication between the NewPass agent and a command-and-control (C2) server. This communication utilizes a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests. The context suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now in the phase of maintaining communication with the compromised host.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for communication between the compromised host and the C2 server. The use of HTTP POST requests falls under this category.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This refers to the use of symmetric encryption for protecting the data communicated between the compromised host and the C2 server. The mention of a custom encryption algorithm aligns with this technique, as symmetric cryptography involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the communication has been established and is using custom encryption, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve leveraging this established communication channel for further malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised host and the C2 server, which aligns with the given scenario but doesn't necessarily represent a "next step" after communication is established.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration** involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. While this could be a next step, it's more specific to the action of stealing data rather than the general maintenance of access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery** involves the attacker learning more about the system and network. This could potentially happen over the established C2 channel but is not directly implied by the use of encrypted HTTP POST requests.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection** involves gathering information relevant to the attacker's goals, which could be facilitated by the established communication channel but, like exfiltration, is more about the action of collecting data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the establishment of a C2 channel with custom encryption, which is a critical step in maintaining access to a compromised system.
   - The use of this channel for further tactics like exfiltration, collection, or discovery would logically follow the establishment of this channel.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the ATT&CK tactic that "most likely occurred after" the establishment of this communication, which suggests looking for a tactic that directly leverages this established channel.
   - Given the context, **Command and Control (A)** is the most directly related tactic to the scenario described, as it encompasses the techniques used (custom encryption for HTTP POST requests) and is the foundation for other tactics like exfiltration or collection.

Final Answer: A
