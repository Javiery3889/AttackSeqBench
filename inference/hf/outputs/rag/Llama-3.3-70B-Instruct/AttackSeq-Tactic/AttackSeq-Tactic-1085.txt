To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial access scenario where spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments are used to deliver the ZeroT downloader. This establishes the initial foothold in the system. The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next to enable communication between ZeroT and its Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP POST beacons.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic and involve phishing techniques, specifically:
   - T1566: Phishing
   - T1566.002: Spearphishing Link
   - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment

   These TTPs are about gaining initial access to a system, which has already been achieved according to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Impact**: This tactic involves causing damage or disruption to a system or data. It doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up C2 infrastructure. While related, the question focuses on the communication aspect post-initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This has already been achieved according to the question, so it's not the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. Given that the ZeroT downloader needs to communicate with its C2 server via HTTP POST beacons, this is the most relevant tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines an initial access scenario using spear-phishing with malicious attachments.
   - The goal is to enable communication between the ZeroT downloader and its C2 server.
   - The provided TTPs confirm the initial access method but do not directly address the communication aspect.
   - The "Command and Control" tactic directly involves communication with a C2 server, which aligns with the need for ZeroT to communicate via HTTP POST beacons.

Final Answer: D
