To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after infected devices with backdoors were used to steal one-time passwords and create WhatsApp and Gmail accounts, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where devices have been infected with backdoors, which were then used to steal one-time passwords. This action allowed the attackers to create new accounts on WhatsApp and Gmail. The focus here is on the exploitation of compromised devices and the misuse of authentication mechanisms (one-time passwords) to gain unauthorized access to services.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This indicates a method used by attackers to maintain access to a system by manipulating authentication processes.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1528-Steal Application Access Token**: This shows an interest in obtaining credentials or access tokens that can be used to access applications without needing the actual password.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This suggests the creation or use of email accounts (or similar online services) for the attacker's purposes, which aligns with the creation of WhatsApp and Gmail accounts mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems or sending commands to them. While command and control is crucial for managing backdoors, the question hints at what happened after the backdoors were used, specifically focusing on the theft of one-time passwords and creation of new accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher privileges on a system than initially granted. While possible in the context of exploiting backdoors, the question does not directly imply an escalation of privileges within a system but rather the use of stolen authentication information to access or create new accounts.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment. The actions described (stealing one-time passwords, creating new accounts) seem more aligned with exploiting access rather than discovering new information about the environment.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**: This tactic directly involves obtaining credentials or access to systems, applications, or services. The theft of one-time passwords and the creation of new accounts (like WhatsApp and Gmail) directly relate to gaining access to these services, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the exploitation of backdoors to steal one-time passwords and create new accounts.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques used for persistence, stealing application access tokens, and creating email accounts, all of which are about accessing or maintaining access to systems and services.
   - Given the focus on using stolen authentication information to access or create new accounts, the most relevant tactic is about gaining access to credentials or services.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the described actions is related to accessing credentials or services.

Final Answer: D
