To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT28 used spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages and before they exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by APT28, starting with spear-phishing to harvest credentials, indicating an initial access tactic. The end goal mentioned is exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain deeper access into victim networks. We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates the exploitation of vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which aligns with the later part of the question.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This involves gathering credentials, which could be related to the initial spear-phishing activity.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This directly relates to the initial action described in the question, where APT28 uses spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial action involves spear-phishing for credential harvesting, the next logical step would involve using those credentials. 
   - **B: Credential Access** is a strong candidate because after obtaining credentials through spear-phishing, the attackers would likely use them to gain access to the system or network. This tactic directly follows the initial access attempts and precedes the exploitation of vulnerabilities for deeper access.
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** might occur after initial access but typically follows the establishment of a foothold, which could be after the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - **C: Resource Development** is less directly related to the sequence of exploiting vulnerabilities and moving deeper into networks.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** could occur after gaining initial access and escalating privileges but is more about moving within the network rather than the immediate step after credential harvesting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers start by using spear-phishing to harvest credentials.
   - The next logical step is to use these credentials to access the system, which aligns with **Credential Access**.
   - After accessing the system, they exploit vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain deeper access.
   
Final Answer: B
