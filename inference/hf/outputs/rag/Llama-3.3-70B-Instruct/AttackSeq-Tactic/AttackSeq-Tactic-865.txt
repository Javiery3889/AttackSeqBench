To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is about determining the ATT&CK tactic that would most likely ensure the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper on every system startup after the execution of "vba_macro.exe" via the Shell command. This implies we are looking for a tactic related to maintaining access or ensuring continued execution of malware.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification**: This suggests modifying shell configurations to persist access or ensure continued execution of malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This involves executing code using Visual Basic, which could be related to the initial execution of "vba_macro.exe".

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It does not directly relate to ensuring the execution of malware on startup.
   - **Lateral Movement (B)**: This involves moving from one system to another within an environment. It's not directly related to ensuring malware execution on system startup.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic is about establishing communication between the malware and the attacker's command and control server. While important for malware operation, it doesn't directly ensure startup execution.
   - **Persistence (D)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system. Ensuring a malware dropper is executed on every system startup falls directly under persistence, as it guarantees continued access or presence on the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks about ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper's execution on every system startup, which directly relates to maintaining access or presence.
   - The provided TTPs highlight techniques under Persistence and Execution, with a focus on modifying configurations for persistence.
   - Given the context, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic for ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup is Persistence, as it directly addresses maintaining access or ensuring continued execution of malware.

Final Answer: D
