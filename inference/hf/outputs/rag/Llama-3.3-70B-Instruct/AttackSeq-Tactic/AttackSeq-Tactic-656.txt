To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware (GAMEFISH) is executed after a spear-phishing email campaign, which is followed by lateral movement within the network by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers. We are asked to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before APT28 moved laterally.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This indicates the use of remote services exploitation to move laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** and **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: These techniques are used for gaining initial access to a network through spear-phishing emails, either by clicking on a link or opening an attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the execution of malware through exploit documents from spear-phishing emails, which aligns with **Initial Access** tactics (T1566.001 and T1566.002).
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step for an adversary like APT28, before moving laterally, would be to establish a foothold and gather necessary credentials or access to facilitate lateral movement. This is where **Credential Access** comes into play. Credential Access (Tactic) involves techniques used to obtain credentials like passwords, keys, or other authentication data. This would be necessary for APT28 to move laterally, especially if the initial access did not provide sufficient privileges for lateral movement.
   - **Resource Development** (A) is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of gaining access and then moving laterally.
   - **Exfiltration** (B) is about stealing data, which would likely occur after lateral movement and establishing access to sensitive areas of the network.
   - **Lateral Movement** (D) is what APT28 does after the step we are trying to identify, not the step itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access is gained through spear-phishing.
   - Before moving laterally by exploiting vulnerabilities, the adversary would likely need to gain appropriate credentials or access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before lateral movement is **Credential Access**, as it would provide the necessary privileges for the subsequent lateral movement.

Final Answer: C
