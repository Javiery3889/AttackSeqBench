To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT33 targeted companies in the oil product supply chain using spear phishing campaigns to gain access, and before they secured persistence within the networks by using botnets, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of events where APT33 uses spear phishing to gain initial access to companies in the oil product supply chain. After gaining access, but before securing persistence using botnets, we need to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic and specifically involve phishing techniques, including spearphishing link (T1566.002) and spearphishing attachment (T1566.001). These are methods used by attackers to initially gain access to a network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Initial Access (B)**: This is the tactic used by APT33 to gain access to the target networks through spear phishing, as described. It's the starting point of the attack sequence mentioned in the question.
    - **Persistence (A)**: This is mentioned as the end goal, where APT33 secures its presence within the networks using botnets. It's what happens after the initial access and the tactic we're trying to find.
    - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure or compromising third-party services. While it could potentially occur after initial access, it's not directly implied by the question's context as the immediate next step before persistence.
    - **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gather information about the network, systems, and applications after gaining access. Given that the attackers need to understand the network layout and potential vulnerabilities to effectively use botnets for persistence, discovery would logically occur after initial access and before establishing persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
    - APT33 uses spear phishing for initial access.
    - After gaining access, to effectively secure persistence (e.g., by using botnets), the attackers would need to understand the network and its vulnerabilities.
    - The discovery tactic aligns with this need, as it involves gathering information about the system, network, and applications, which would be necessary before attempting to secure persistence.

**Final Answer: D**
