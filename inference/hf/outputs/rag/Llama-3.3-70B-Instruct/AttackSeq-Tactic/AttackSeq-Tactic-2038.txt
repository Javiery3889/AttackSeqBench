To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Dragonfly attackers used remote-desktop protocol to maintain access to victim networks, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The attackers achieved initial access through spear-phishing emails and executed a Trojan backdoor through trusted software. This indicates the attackers have already gained access to the network and are looking to maintain or expand their presence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This confirms the initial method of gaining access was through phishing, aligning with the information provided in the question.
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This indicates the attackers used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement, which is a method to move through the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is crucial for attackers to remain undetected, the question focuses on the sequence leading up to using RDP for maintaining access, not specifically on evading defenses.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted. It's plausible that after initial access, attackers would escalate privileges to use RDP or other network services effectively.
   - **C: Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the network and systems. While discovery is essential for understanding the environment, the question implies a progression towards maintaining access rather than just exploring.
   - **D: Persistence**: Persistence is about maintaining access to the system, but the question asks for the tactic before using RDP for this purpose, suggesting we're looking for something that enables or precedes the use of RDP for persistence.

Given the context, **Privilege Escalation (B)** seems the most likely tactic to have occurred before using RDP. This is because, to effectively use RDP for maintaining access and possibly for lateral movement, attackers would likely need elevated privileges to bypass security restrictions and ensure uninterrupted access to the network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained through phishing.
2. A Trojan backdoor is executed, potentially requiring or facilitating privilege escalation to function effectively or to install itself in a persistent manner.
3. With elevated privileges, attackers can more easily use RDP for lateral movement and persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
