To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 utilized Mimikatz for credential theft and before they logged in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by APT10, starting with the use of Mimikatz for credential theft. This implies that the attackers have already gained some level of access to the network, enough to execute Mimikatz, which is a tool used for extracting credentials from a Windows system. After obtaining credentials, they use these to log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) include:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests the use of valid accounts to evade detection, which aligns with the use of stolen credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This implies gaining initial access to a network using valid accounts, which could be relevant but doesn't directly apply to the "after credential theft" scenario since initial access might have already been achieved to use Mimikatz.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This involves using external services to maintain access, which could be relevant after gaining credentials but doesn't directly address the immediate action of using those credentials for further network access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While collection activities might occur at various stages of an attack, they don't directly relate to the act of using stolen credentials to access a network.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers. It doesn't directly fit the scenario of using credentials to access a network.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network, often to expand access or reach specific data. Using stolen credentials to log in to a network via Citrix servers could be part of lateral movement, especially if the attackers are moving from an initially compromised system to other parts of the network.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials, which has already been achieved through the use of Mimikatz. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after credential theft.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that APT10 has already obtained credentials using Mimikatz, the next logical step in their attack sequence, before logging in to the Visma network, would involve using those credentials to further their access within the network.
   - The use of valid accounts (obtained through Mimikatz) to log in to the Citrix servers suggests movement within the network, aiming to access more systems or data.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)** is the most plausible tactic as it directly relates to the action of using stolen credentials to access more parts of the network, which aligns with the scenario of logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers.

Final Answer: C
