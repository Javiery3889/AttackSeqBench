To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials along with campaign codes to its infrastructure, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions FIN4 transmitting stolen credentials and campaign codes to its infrastructure. This action implies that FIN4 has already gained access to the credentials, which is a crucial step in the attack sequence. The transmission of these credentials to their infrastructure suggests they are preparing for further actions within the compromised network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This indicates the use of valid accounts to evade detection, which could be a step after gaining access to credentials.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This shows that valid accounts are used for initial access, which aligns with the idea of using stolen credentials for gaining access to a system or network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This involves gathering information about credentials, which could be part of the initial steps in an attack sequence but doesn't directly relate to the action of transmitting stolen credentials to infrastructure.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that FIN4 has already obtained and transmitted stolen credentials, the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve using these credentials for further malicious activities.
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This involves stealing data, which could be a goal after gaining access but doesn't directly relate to the transmission of credentials to the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure, which aligns with the transmission of credentials and campaign codes to their infrastructure. It suggests that FIN4 is setting up or has set up a means to control the compromised systems or networks.
   - **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials, which has already been achieved according to the question.
   - **Reconnaissance (D)**: While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, the specific action of transmitting credentials to infrastructure suggests a step beyond initial information gathering.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - FIN4 has transmitted stolen credentials and campaign codes to its infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs indicate the use of valid accounts for defense evasion and initial access, suggesting that the credentials are being used for malicious purposes within the network.
   - The most logical next step after transmitting credentials to their infrastructure would be to establish a means of command and control to utilize these credentials effectively.

Final Answer: B
