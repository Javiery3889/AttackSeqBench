To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Longhorn's malware communicated with their C&C (Command and Control) servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that Longhorn's malware communicated with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This indicates an effort to hide or protect the communication, which is a key aspect of Command and Control (C2) operations. The use of HTTPS and a custom cryptographic protocol suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain stealthy communication channels with the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This TTP is directly related to the scenario described, as it involves using web protocols (like HTTPS) for C2 communications. The custom cryptographic protocol used by Longhorn's malware fits within the context of using web protocols for command and control, enhancing the stealthiness of the communication.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This TTP involves exfiltrating data using encrypted channels that are not typically used for command and control. While this does involve encryption, it's more focused on the exfiltration of data rather than the establishment or maintenance of command and control channels.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C&C servers, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to either continue using this communication for further commands (which could include preparing for or executing lateral movement or exfiltration) or to move laterally within the network, or to exfiltrate data.
   - **Option D: Command and Control** is what has already occurred, as described in the question. The question asks for what likely happened "after" this communication was established.
   - **Option A: Discovery** could be a part of the attack sequence but is not directly implied by the establishment of secure C2 communications.
   - **Option C: Lateral Movement** is plausible as it often follows the establishment of a foothold in a network. However, the question specifically mentions communication with C&C servers, which could precede lateral movement but doesn't directly imply it as the next step.
   - **Option B: Exfiltration** is a strong candidate because, after establishing secure C2 communications, exfiltrating sensitive data could be a primary objective. The use of custom cryptographic protocols for C2 could also imply that similar or related techniques (like encrypted channels) might be used for exfiltration, aligning with T1048.002.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the establishment of secure command and control communications.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of web protocols for C2 and the exfiltration of data over encrypted non-C2 protocols.
   - Considering the logical progression of an attack, after establishing C2, an attacker might proceed with actions like lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - Given the emphasis on secure communication and the context provided by the related TTPs, exfiltration (which could utilize similar secure communication methods for data transfer) seems like a plausible next step.

Final Answer: B
