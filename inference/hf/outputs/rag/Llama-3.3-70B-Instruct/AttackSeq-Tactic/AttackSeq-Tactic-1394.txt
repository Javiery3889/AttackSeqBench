To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 used dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP) for interconnected command and control infrastructure linking back to their previous operations, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of dynamic-DNS domains and specific tools (Robocopy and PSCP) by APT10. This indicates a level of sophistication in their command and control (C2) infrastructure, suggesting they are beyond the initial stages of an attack. The use of these tools and techniques implies a need for maintaining access, moving laterally within a network, and possibly exfiltrating data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: 
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH**: This suggests that the attackers are using SSH to move laterally within the network. SSH is a common protocol used for secure remote access, and its use here indicates an attempt to expand access within the compromised network.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: The use of dynamic-DNS for command and control indicates an effort to maintain a resilient C2 channel. Dynamic DNS allows the attackers to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with their domains, making it harder for defenders to block their C2 communications.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given the context of using dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP, it's clear that APT10 is focused on establishing and maintaining a robust command and control infrastructure. This infrastructure is crucial for the next steps of the attack, which could include lateral movement, data collection, and potentially data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control** is directly related to the use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools for maintaining C2 infrastructure. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** these actions, suggesting we're looking for a consequence or next step of having a solid C2 in place.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access** could be a part of the attack but doesn't directly follow from the establishment of C2 infrastructure without additional context on credential theft or use.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection** is a plausible next step after establishing a robust C2 channel, as the attackers would likely use their access and control to collect sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery** might occur in parallel or as part of the lateral movement but doesn't directly follow the establishment of C2 as a necessary next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of dynamic-DNS and specific tools indicates a mature phase of the attack focused on C2.
   - The related TTPs highlight lateral movement and command and control techniques.
   - Considering the next logical steps after establishing robust C2, collection of data becomes a primary objective, as the attackers would seek to leverage their access for data exfiltration or further exploitation.
   
Final Answer: C
