To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers established Command and Control (C2), let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that attackers have already established Command and Control using stealth methods such as backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling. This implies that the attackers have successfully set up a means to communicate with the compromised system without being easily detected. The goal here is to maintain compromise persistence and facilitate data exfiltration.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on the Command and Control tactic, specifically mentioning techniques related to protocol or service impersonation (T1001.003) and DNS tunneling (T1071.004). These techniques are used to hide or disguise the C2 communication, making it harder for defenders to detect.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining resources (e.g., infrastructure, capabilities) that can be used to support their operations. While resource development could be a part of the broader campaign, it doesn't directly follow the establishment of C2 in terms of immediate tactical objectives related to the compromised system.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that has already been established, according to the question. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after C2 was established, so this choice seems to be what has already been accomplished.
   - **C: Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials is a common step after establishing a foothold in a network, as it allows attackers to move laterally, escalate privileges, and maintain access. However, the question emphasizes the use of stealthy C2 methods for persistence and data exfiltration, not necessarily the initial steps of gaining access or escalating privileges.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt, corrupt, or destroy systems and data. Given that the attackers are focused on maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data using stealthy C2 methods, causing direct impact might not be the immediate next step unless the goal is to cover tracks or punish the target.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question implies that the attackers have secured a way to communicate with the compromised system stealthily.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques used for maintaining this stealthy communication.
   - Considering typical attack flows, after establishing C2, attackers often look to leverage their access for further malicious activities such as data exfiltration, which might require additional steps like moving laterally or escalating privileges, but the question points towards actions that follow the establishment of a reliable and hidden C2 channel.
   - Given the emphasis on persistence and data exfiltration, and considering the tactics provided, **Resource Development (A)** seems like a plausible next step as it could involve setting up infrastructure for exfiltrating data or preparing for further operations, but it doesn't directly relate to the immediate post-C2 activities like data exfiltration or further system compromise.
   - However, upon closer consideration, the question's context suggests looking for a tactic that directly benefits from established C2. Since **Impact (D)** is about causing harm and **Credential Access (C)** is more about gaining access (which might have already been partially achieved by establishing C2), and given that **Command and Control (B)** is what's already been established, the most fitting answer considering typical attack progression and the provided context would actually be **Impact (D)**, as it represents a potential next step where the attackers, having secured their C2, look to achieve their objectives, whether through data exfiltration (which could be seen as a form of impact) or other means of affecting the target system.

**Final Answer: D**
