To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices such as MVPower DVR and Huawei routers before KiraV2 executed various DDoS attacks and distributed itself to other IoT devices. This implies we are looking for the initial stage of the attack where the attacker gains access to the IoT devices.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This involves using network devices for resource development, which could be relevant after initial access is gained.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This involves executing malicious code, which is more aligned with actions taken after initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which aligns with exploiting vulnerabilities in devices to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which would occur after the initial access is gained.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves discovering information about the target environment, which might not directly relate to exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic directly involves gaining access to a system or network, which aligns with exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which would occur after initial access is gained.

Given the context of exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices to gain access before executing further attacks, the most relevant tactic is gaining **Initial Access**. This is because exploiting vulnerabilities in devices like MVPower DVR and Huawei routers would be a method to initially access these devices, aligning with the **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the initial stage of an attack where vulnerabilities are exploited.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - The provided TTPs support this reasoning, especially **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gaining **Initial Access** to the IoT devices.

Final Answer: C
