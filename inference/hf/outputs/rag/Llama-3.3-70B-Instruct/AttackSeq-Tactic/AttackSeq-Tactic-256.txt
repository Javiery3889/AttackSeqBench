To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before UNC2452 used a supply chain compromise for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the supply chain compromise was used for Initial Access. This means we are looking for a tactic that would logically precede the initial access phase, particularly in the context of a sophisticated attack like the SolarWinds Orion platform attack.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on Initial Access, specifically Technique T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) and its sub-technique T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain). This indicates the attack involved compromising the software supply chain to gain initial access to the target environment.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It is a plausible precursor to the initial access phase, as attackers would typically need to gather information about potential vulnerabilities or entry points before attempting to compromise a system or network.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control servers. It is unlikely to occur before initial access, as it requires the attacker to already have a foothold in the target environment.
   - **C: Discovery**: While discovery is an important phase in the attack lifecycle, involving the identification of systems, users, and other details within the target environment, it typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development and acquisition of resources, such as infrastructure or capabilities, that can be used to support an attack. While it could potentially occur before initial access, it is more about preparing for the attack rather than directly preceding the initial access tactic in a linear sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the SolarWinds Orion platform attack, which involved a sophisticated supply chain compromise, it's logical to assume that the attackers would have needed to gather information about the target environment and the software supply chain before attempting to compromise it.
   - Reconnaissance (A) is the most likely tactic to have occurred before the initial access, as it aligns with the preparatory phase of an attack where attackers gather necessary information to plan their approach.
   - The other options either occur after initial access (B and C) or are not directly related to the sequence of actions leading up to initial access in this specific context (D).

Final Answer: A
