To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Emissary Trojan has implemented updates for evasion, including altering configuration storage and recompiled PE headers. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to establish communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure. This implies we are looking for the tactic related to how the malware communicates with its command and control (C2) servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols, T1071.004-DNS) and Defense Evasion (T1027.009-Embedded Payloads). The focus here is on how malware communicates with its C2 servers, using web protocols or DNS, which are techniques under the Command and Control tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Exfiltration** is the tactic of stealing data from a target. While communication with C2 servers can be involved, the primary goal of exfiltration is data theft, not establishing communication for command and control purposes.
   - **B: Command and Control** is the tactic of establishing communication between the malware and the attacker's C2 servers. This allows the attacker to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system. Given the context of establishing communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** involves techniques used by attackers to evade detection. While the question mentions evasion techniques used by the Emissary Trojan, the question specifically asks about establishing communication, not evading defenses.
   - **D: Discovery** is about gaining knowledge of the target system or network. This does not directly relate to establishing communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the establishment of communication with C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under the Command and Control tactic.
   - Establishing communication for issuing commands or receiving data aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for establishing communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure after evasion techniques have been implemented is related to Command and Control.

Final Answer: B
