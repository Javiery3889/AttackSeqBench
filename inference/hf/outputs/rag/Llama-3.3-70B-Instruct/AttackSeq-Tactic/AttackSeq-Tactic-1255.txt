To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Fox Kitten Campaign's reconnaissance activities, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes the Fox Kitten Campaign's initial activities as reconnaissance, focusing on industries like IT, Telecommunication, and Government. The goal of this reconnaissance was to develop access routes for further breaches, specifically through supply-chain attacks. This implies that the initial phase of gathering information has been completed, and the next steps would involve using the gathered intelligence to gain access to targeted systems or networks.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic. This includes:
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a supply chain to gain access to a target organization. This directly aligns with the mention of supply-chain attacks in the question.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves gaining access by compromising a user's system through a web-based attack when the user visits a compromised website. While relevant to initial access, it doesn't directly relate to supply-chain attacks.
   - **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This is a sub-technique of supply chain compromise, focusing specifically on software supply chains. It also aligns with the context of supply-chain attacks.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This is the tactic that has already been completed according to the question. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after reconnaissance.
   - **B: Resource Development**: While resource development is a crucial aspect of an attacker's lifecycle, the question specifically mentions activities leading to supply-chain attacks, which are more directly related to gaining initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access**: Given the context of supply-chain attacks and the techniques provided (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, T1189-Drive-by Compromise, T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain), this tactic is the most relevant. The attackers have completed reconnaissance and are now using that information to gain initial access through compromised supply chains.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves carrying out the attack once access has been gained. While it is a subsequent step, the question focuses on the transition from reconnaissance to the next phase, which is gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines an attack sequence starting with reconnaissance aimed at facilitating supply-chain attacks.
   - The related TTPs highlight techniques under the "Initial Access" tactic, particularly those involving supply chain compromise.
   - Therefore, the most logical next step after reconnaissance, given the context of supply-chain attacks, is gaining "Initial Access" to the targeted systems or networks.

Final Answer: C
