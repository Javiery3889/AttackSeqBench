To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after enabling macros that executed payloads and before the campaign's backdoor function gathered machine information and sent it to the C&C server, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of events where macros are enabled, leading to the execution of payloads. This is followed by an unspecified tactic, and then a backdoor function gathers machine information and sends it to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The key here is understanding the sequence of events in an attack and how tactics are used to achieve the attacker's goals.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This indicates that the attack involves executing malicious files, which aligns with the execution of payloads mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This suggests that the initial access vector for the attack could be through spearphishing, which is a common method for delivering malicious files or links that lead to malicious files.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to evade detection. While defense evasion is crucial throughout an attack, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described, as it's more about maintaining access or avoiding detection rather than a step that necessarily occurs after payload execution and before data gathering.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system. Enabling macros that execute payloads could be a form of initial access or execution, but the act of gathering machine information and sending it to a C&C server suggests the attacker is moving beyond initial execution and towards establishing a foothold, which persistence is a part of.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system or network. While the backdoor function gathering machine information aligns with discovery, the question asks for the tactic before this gathering occurs. Discovery is more about the action of gathering information itself.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic is about executing malicious code, which has already occurred according to the question (enabling macros that executed payloads). Thus, it's less likely to be the correct answer since we're looking for what happens after execution.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the execution of payloads (via enabled macros) and before the backdoor gathers and sends machine information to the C&C server is **Persistence (B)**. This is because, after gaining initial access and executing code, an attacker would likely seek to establish a persistent presence on the system to facilitate further actions, such as gathering information, which is a precursor to the backdoor's activities described.

**Final Answer: B**
