To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Octopus malware has already gathered system information (such as disk name, computer name, and user name) using WMIC.exe. This action is indicative of the Discovery tactic, specifically the System Information Discovery technique (T1082). The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next as the malware communicates with hardcoded commercial web-hosting servers to receive commands like file uploads or downloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the Discovery tactic and the System Information Discovery technique (T1082). This context suggests that the initial action of gathering system information is part of the Discovery phase, where the attacker is trying to understand the environment they have compromised.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While lateral movement could potentially occur after initial system compromise, the description provided does not directly imply movement to another system but rather communication with external servers for command and control.
   - **B: Discovery**: The Discovery tactic has already been partially executed through the gathering of system information. However, the question asks for the next likely tactic after this initial discovery.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control servers to issue commands and receive stolen data. The description of the malware communicating with hardcoded commercial web-hosting servers to receive commands aligns closely with this tactic.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security systems. While defense evasion could be a part of the attack sequence, the specific action of communicating with command and control servers for file uploads or downloads does not directly imply evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action of gathering system information using WMIC.exe is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The next action described involves communication with external servers for receiving commands, which is characteristic of the Command and Control tactic.
   - Therefore, the most logical sequence is that after the initial discovery, the malware would establish Command and Control to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: C
