To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros. After this initial access, PowerShell scripts are executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of these PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. This indicates the use of PowerShell to execute commands, which aligns with the execution of PowerShell scripts mentioned in the question.
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange. This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute code, which could be related to the initial exploitation of the Microsoft Word document but is less directly related to the execution of PowerShell scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**. This tactic directly involves executing malicious code, which includes the execution of PowerShell scripts. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**. This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While reconnaissance might occur at some point during an attack, it is not directly implied by the execution of PowerShell scripts following initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**. This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold on the system, which is described in the question as happening through a malicious Microsoft Word document. The execution of PowerShell scripts to decode and run backdoor components would logically follow initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**. This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an environment, which is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell scripts following initial access through a malicious document.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document, which directly aligns with **Initial Access**.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components is an action that would occur after gaining initial access, as it involves executing code within the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most logical sequence is that **Initial Access** occurred before the execution of PowerShell scripts.

Final Answer: C
