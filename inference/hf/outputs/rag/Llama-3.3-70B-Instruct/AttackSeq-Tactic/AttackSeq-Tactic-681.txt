To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Volatile Cedar gained initial access, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Volatile Cedar has already gained initial access to a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing web servers. This means the initial stage of the attack, which involves getting into the system, has been completed. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application". This technique is a method used to gain initial access, which aligns with the scenario described in the question where the initial access was gained through vulnerability exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**: After gaining initial access, an attacker's next logical step often involves establishing persistence. This means they would try to maintain their access to the system over time, despite changes to the environment or attempts to remove them. Persistence is a critical phase that follows initial access, as it allows the attacker to continue their operations without needing to re-exploit the same vulnerability every time.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that has already been accomplished according to the question, so it cannot be what occurred after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**: While resource development is an important aspect of an attacker's campaign, it typically follows after the attacker has established a foothold and is looking to expand their capabilities or prepare for further actions. It's less directly related to the immediate actions following initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**: Execution refers to the tactic of running malicious code on a compromised system. While this could occur after initial access, it's more of a specific action rather than a broad tactic that encompasses the immediate post-access activities like establishing a persistent presence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after gaining initial access.
   - Initial access has already been achieved through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - The next logical step for an attacker would be to ensure they can maintain access over time.
   - Persistence is the tactic that directly aligns with this goal.

Final Answer: A
