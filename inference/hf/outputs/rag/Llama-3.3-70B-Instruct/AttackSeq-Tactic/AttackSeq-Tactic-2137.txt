To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT15 has already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz for privilege escalation. The focus is on what happens next, specifically how their RoyalCLI backdoor bypasses policy settings to execute commands, and which ATT&CK tactic this action most likely falls under.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) include:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** with the technique **T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control**. This indicates a method used to gain higher privileges.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with the same technique **T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control**. This suggests evading security measures to maintain access or execute malicious activities without detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)** has already been achieved as per the question stem (using Mimikatz), so while relevant, it's not what's being asked about the next step.
   - **Discovery (C)** and **Collection (D)** tactics are not directly related to the action of bypassing policy settings to execute commands.
   - **Defense Evasion (A)** directly relates to the action of bypassing security controls or policy settings, such as those that disable command prompt execution, to execute the RoyalCLI backdoor. The technique **T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control** is listed under Defense Evasion, which aligns with the goal of evading policy settings to execute commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely follows the initial privilege escalation, focusing on the action of bypassing policy settings.
   - Given that the initial privilege escalation has already occurred, we're looking for the tactic related to evading security controls.
   - The related TTPs show that **T1548.002 - Bypass User Account Control** can be used for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion, but in the context of bypassing policy settings to execute a backdoor, it aligns more closely with Defense Evasion.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after gaining domain administrator credentials is to use the gained privileges to evade defense mechanisms, such as policy settings that restrict command execution.

Final Answer: A
