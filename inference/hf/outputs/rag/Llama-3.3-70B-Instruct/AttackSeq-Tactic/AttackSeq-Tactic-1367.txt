To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks by exploiting external servers and deploying web shells. This indicates that the initial step involved gaining access to the network, likely through an external vector.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This indicates the use of web shells to maintain persistence within the network. Web shells are often used after initial access has been gained to provide a reliable way to access the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This suggests that the initial entry point into the network was through external remote services, which aligns with the exploitation of external servers mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: While reconnaissance is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, often occurring before the initial access, the question specifically asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before establishing a foothold, which implies the attacker has already gathered necessary information.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: Defense evasion techniques are used to avoid detection, which can occur at various stages of the attack, including after initial access. However, it's not directly related to the act of establishing a foothold.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement occurs after an attacker has already gained access to a network and is trying to move within it. This is not the initial step in establishing a foothold.
   - **D: Initial Access**: Given that the related TTPs include the exploitation of external remote services (T1133) for initial access, and the question describes exploiting external servers to deploy web shells, the most logical precursor to establishing a foothold is gaining initial access to the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The exploitation of external servers and the deployment of web shells as described indicate actions taken after gaining initial access.
   - The related TTPs support the use of external remote services for initial access, which aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that the attackers first gained **Initial Access** to the network, which then allowed them to establish a foothold by deploying web shells.

Final Answer: D
