To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after employing techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting, we are looking for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 (a known threat actor group) used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations. The key elements here are the use of LSASS memory dumping, which is a technique for credential harvesting, and the subsequent use of native OS binaries and custom malware for information gathering.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Credential Access" and the technique "T1003.001-LSASS Memory". This indicates that the attackers were focused on gaining access to credentials, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question (process memory dumping of LSASS).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems. While it's a crucial part of many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the initial steps of credential harvesting or the subsequent information gathering using native OS binaries and custom malware.
    - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Given that FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations after credential harvesting, Discovery seems like a plausible next step after gaining access to the system.
    - **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target before actually engaging with it. Since the question describes actions that have already been taken within the system (credential harvesting), Reconnaissance would have occurred before these actions, not immediately before the use of native OS binaries and custom malware for information gathering.
    - **Credential Access (D)**: This is the tactic that involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question mentions that credential harvesting has already occurred, so while Credential Access is relevant, it's what has led to the current point, not what comes before the described actions of FIN13.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question outlines a sequence where credential harvesting (part of Credential Access) has occurred.
    - The use of native OS binaries and custom malware for gathering information on network and host configurations suggests a phase of the attack focused on discovering more about the system and network.
    - Given the context, **Discovery (B)** is the most logical choice because it directly follows the initial compromise and credential harvesting, aligning with the actions described (using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather more information).

Final Answer: B
