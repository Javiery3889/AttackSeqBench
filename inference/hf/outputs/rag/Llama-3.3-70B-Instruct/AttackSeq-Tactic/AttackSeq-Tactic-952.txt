To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443. This implies that the attacker is attempting to hide their command and control (C2) communications within legitimate traffic to avoid detection. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the tactic of Command and Control. Specifically, they include:
   - **T1001.003 - Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique involves disguising malicious traffic as legitimate traffic, which aligns with blending C2 communications with normal SSL traffic.
   - **T1571 - Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using unusual ports for C2, but in this scenario, the use of port 443 (a standard port for SSL/TLS) is mentioned, which is the opposite.
   - **T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric encryption for C2 communications, which aligns with the use of the Camellia cipher for encryption.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the encryption and blending of C2 communications with normal SSL traffic are techniques used to establish a covert channel for command and control, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to use this established channel for command and control purposes. The techniques mentioned (encryption and impersonation of legitimate traffic) are means to an end, where the end is to maintain control over the compromised system without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of encryption (T1573.001) and blending with normal SSL traffic (T1001.003) suggests an effort to hide C2 communications.
   - These actions are typical of setting up a reliable and covert channel for command and control.
   - After establishing such a channel, the next logical step would be to use it for its intended purpose: issuing commands to the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after these preparations is Command and Control, as it involves using the established covert channel to direct the compromised system to perform specific actions.

Final Answer: B
