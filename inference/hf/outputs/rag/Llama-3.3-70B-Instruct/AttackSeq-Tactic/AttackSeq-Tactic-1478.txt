To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Duke group securely communicated with their command-and-control server, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the Duke group used layered encryption and encoding for managing compromised systems. This implies they have already established a secure communication channel with their command-and-control (C2) server. The use of encryption and encoding techniques (like those mentioned in the Related TTPs: T1132.001 - Standard Encoding and T1573 - Encrypted Channel) is a method to protect their C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect and intercept.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The Related TTPs provided are both under the tactic of Command and Control. T1132.001 (Standard Encoding) and T1573 (Encrypted Channel) are techniques used to hide or encrypt C2 communications, ensuring that the commands sent to and from the compromised systems are not easily detectable. This indicates the group is in the phase of maintaining access and potentially preparing for further actions within the compromised network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information relevant to the adversary's goal. While collection could occur at various stages of an attack, it is a plausible next step after establishing secure C2, as the adversary would likely want to gather more information about the compromised system or network.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This involves transferring data from the compromised system to the adversary's system. Exfiltration could be a goal but typically follows after the adversary has collected data worth exfiltrating.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving through a network to expand access. After establishing secure C2, an adversary might attempt lateral movement to increase their foothold within the network.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that has already been described as occurring, involving the establishment of secure communication channels for controlling compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that the Duke group has already established secure communication with their C2 server, the most immediate next steps would likely involve utilizing this secure channel for further malicious activities.
   - **Collection (A)** and **Lateral Movement (C)** are both plausible next steps as they utilize the established C2 channel for further network exploration or expansion.
   - However, **Collection (A)** is a more direct next step after establishing secure C2, as it involves using the established channel to gather more information about the system or network, which can then inform decisions about what data to exfiltrate or where to move laterally within the network.
   - **Exfiltration (B)** and **Command and Control (D)** are less likely as the immediate next step since exfiltration typically follows collection, and command and control is what has just been established.

**Final Answer: A**
