To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where initial access is achieved through emails embedding malicious documents. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a system. After the initial access, the question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Dridex malware communicated with its command and control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for communication between the malware and the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** and **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: These techniques are related to gaining initial access through spearphishing, either by clicking on a link or opening a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access is achieved through spearphishing with malicious documents (T1566.001), which aligns with the given scenario.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the malware (Dridex) communicated with its C2 servers. This communication is an example of Command and Control (T1071.001).
   - **Execution (C)** is the tactic that involves executing malicious code on the victim's system. Given that the malware needs to be executed before it can communicate with its C2 servers, this tactic is a likely candidate.
   - **Lateral Movement (A)** involves moving laterally within a network, which might not necessarily occur before C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration (B)** involves stealing data, which could happen after the malware has established communication with its C2 servers.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)** involves evading detection, which could happen at various stages of the attack but isn't directly related to the sequence of initial access and C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Initial access is gained through spearphishing with a malicious attachment.
   - For the malware to communicate with its C2 servers, it first needs to be executed on the victim's system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after initial access, the malware is executed, and then it communicates with its C2 servers.

Final Answer: C
