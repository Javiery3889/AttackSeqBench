To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT28 used the Komplex Binder to deliver the dropper, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 uses the Komplex Binder to deliver a dropper. The dropper is saved on the system, and a decoy PDF file is opened to initiate the attack. This action implies that the initial phase of the attack involves getting malicious code to run on the victim's system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1204.002 - Malicious File." Execution as a tactic involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. The technique T1204.002 specifically refers to using malicious files to execute code.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that allow an adversary to initially access a network. Given that the dropper has already been delivered and a decoy PDF is used to initiate the attack, the initial access has likely already occurred.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic aligns with the action of running the dropper and using a decoy PDF to initiate the attack. The use of a malicious file (as indicated by T1204.002) to execute code fits within the execution tactic.
   - **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While collection might occur at some point during the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the action of delivering and executing a dropper.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The described action does not indicate movement between systems but rather the initial execution of malicious code on a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The delivery of a dropper and the use of a decoy PDF to initiate an attack suggest that the primary goal at this stage is to execute malicious code on the victim's system.
   - The related TTPs highlight the execution tactic and the use of malicious files, which aligns with the described actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after delivering the dropper is the execution of the malicious code.

Final Answer: B
