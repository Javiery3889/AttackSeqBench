To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a trojanized version of software (3CX) is used in a supply chain attack to distribute Smooth Operator malware to macOS systems. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the target systems through the compromised software.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain
   Both of these TTPs are related to the initial access tactic, specifically focusing on supply chain compromise as the method of gaining initial access to the target systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold within the network. Given that the supply chain attack has already been successful in distributing the trojanized software, the initial access has been achieved. This tactic aligns with the techniques provided (T1195 and T1195.002), which are about compromising the supply chain to gain access.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code within the target environment. While execution of the Smooth Operator malware is a likely next step after the initial access, the question asks for the tactic that "most likely occurred after" the distribution of the trojanized software, implying we are looking for the immediate consequence of the supply chain attack.
   - **Credential Access (B)** and **Discovery (A)**: These tactics involve obtaining credentials or discovering information about the target system, respectively. While these could be subsequent steps in an attack, they are not the immediate result of a successful supply chain attack aimed at distributing malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The supply chain attack using a trojanized version of the 3CX software is a method of gaining **Initial Access**.
   - The techniques provided (T1195 and T1195.002) directly relate to **Initial Access** through supply chain compromise.
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after the distribution of the malware, which implies the initial foothold has been established.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice, given the context of the question and the related TTPs, is **Initial Access**, as it directly corresponds to the tactic of gaining entry into the target systems through the compromised software supply chain.

Final Answer: D
