To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Lazarus group maintained communication with command and control servers, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus group using backdoor malware to execute remote commands during the FEIB heist. This indicates an established communication channel between the attackers and their command and control (C2) servers. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this communication was established.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the Command and Control tactic. Specifically:
   - **T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple communication channels to hide the true destination of the C2 traffic.
   - **T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**: This sub-technique involves establishing communication that allows both the attacker and the compromised system to send and receive data.
   - **T1008 - Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is compromised or blocked.

   These TTPs suggest a focus on establishing and maintaining reliable and covert communication between the attackers and the compromised systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or data. While credential access might be necessary for the initial compromise or for moving laterally within a network, it doesn't directly follow the establishment of C2 communication.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic involves causing direct impact on the target, such as data destruction, denial of service, or data encryption for ransom. Impact tactics could occur after establishing C2, as the attackers might use the established communication to deliver payloads that cause impact.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. Given that the backdoor malware was used to execute remote commands, execution is likely an ongoing process throughout the attack, including after the establishment of C2.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers. The question states this has already been achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that communication with C2 servers has been established and used for executing remote commands.
   - The related TTPs focus on the Command and Control tactic, indicating a strong emphasis on communication.
   - Given that the attackers have established a means to execute commands remotely, the next logical step would involve using this capability to achieve their objectives, which could include causing impact or further executing malicious code.
   - Between B (Impact) and C (Execution), **C: Execution** is more directly related to the action of executing remote commands through the established backdoor, which is a continuation of the attack sequence described.

Final Answer: C
