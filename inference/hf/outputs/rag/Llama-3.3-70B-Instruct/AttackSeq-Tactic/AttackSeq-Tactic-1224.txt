To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next in the attack sequence, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The attackers have already used a backdoor Trojan (PoisonIvy) to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server. This indicates they have established a means of remote access and control over the compromised system. They have also prepared the intellectual property for exfiltration by copying it to archives on internal systems. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next as they completed the attack.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This involves staging data in a location that is accessible to the adversary, typically for exfiltration. This technique is relevant because the attackers have already prepared the intellectual property by copying it to archives, which could be considered a form of data staging.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which aligns with the action of copying intellectual property to archives on internal systems.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. Given that the attackers have a C&C channel established via the PoisonIvy backdoor, this is a plausible next step for completing the attack, especially since they have prepared the data for exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**: This tactic involves disrupting, modifying, or destroying systems and data. While possible, the context provided focuses on data exfiltration rather than causing impact.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system. The use of a backdoor Trojan indicates persistence, but the question asks about the next step after preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**: Given the preparation of intellectual property and the establishment of a C&C channel, exfiltrating the data is a logical next step. The related TTPs support this, especially T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: While command and control is already established, the question asks for the next tactic in completing the attack, which implies moving beyond just maintaining control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have established a means of remote access and control.
   - They have prepared the intellectual property for exfiltration by copying it to archives.
   - The related TTPs suggest that exfiltration, specifically over a C2 channel, is a likely next step.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs leads to the conclusion that the next tactic in completing the attack is exfiltration.

Final Answer: C
