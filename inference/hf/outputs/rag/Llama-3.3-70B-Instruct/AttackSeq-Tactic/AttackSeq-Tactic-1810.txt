To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have collected credentials, prepared them for transmission, and then established a mechanism to upload these stolen credentials to an external FTP server. The key action here is the upload of stolen credentials to an external server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Exfiltration (Tactic)** with **Automated Exfiltration (Technique: T1020)**: This involves automatically exfiltrating data from a network.
   - **Reconnaissance (Tactic)** with **Credentials (Technique: T1589.001)**: This involves gathering information about the target, including credentials.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic)** with **File Transfer Protocols (Technique: T1071.002)**: This involves using file transfer protocols for command and control communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration** is about moving data from a network, which aligns with uploading stolen credentials to an external server.
   - **Reconnaissance** involves gathering information and does not directly relate to the act of uploading data to an external server.
   - **Command and Control** involves maintaining control over a compromised system, which can include using file transfer protocols but is broader than just exfiltrating data.
   - Given the specific action of uploading stolen credentials, the most relevant tactic is **Exfiltration**. However, the answer choices do not directly include "Exfiltration." We need to find the closest match among the provided options.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when attackers uploaded stolen credentials to an external FTP server.
   - Uploading stolen credentials is a form of data exfiltration.
   - Among the answer choices, **Exfiltration** is not directly listed, but based on the context, we are looking for an action that involves moving data out of the network.
   - **Resource Development (A)** could involve setting up infrastructure for exfiltration but is not the act itself.
   - **Collection (B)** is related to gathering data, which is what happened before the upload, not the upload itself.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)** is about gathering information and does not directly involve data transfer out of the network.
   - **Command and Control (D)** can involve data transfer but is more about maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - Given the closest match based on the action described (uploading stolen credentials), and considering that **Exfiltration** is not an option but is closely related to the action of uploading data, we must choose the option that best aligns with the outcome of such an action. Since **Exfiltration** is not an option, and considering the context provided by the related TTPs, the action of uploading credentials to an external server for command and control purposes or for exfiltration purposes can sometimes overlap. However, the specific mention of uploading to an external FTP server aligns more closely with the concept of exfiltrating data, which is not directly listed. Among the provided choices, the closest in terms of network activity related to the described action (uploading data) would be **Command and Control**, as it can involve the use of protocols for transferring files (like FTP) for various purposes, including exfiltration, even though it's a broader category.

Final Answer: D
