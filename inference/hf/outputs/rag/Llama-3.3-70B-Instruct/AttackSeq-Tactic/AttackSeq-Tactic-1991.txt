To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Lazarus group gained initial access and before they achieved persistence, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The Lazarus group used malicious Word documents with macros to gain initial access. This means the initial access vector is already established, so we're looking for a tactic that follows initial access but precedes persistence. The question mentions achieving persistence through auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware, indicating a sequence of actions where the group is moving from gaining access to establishing a more stable foothold.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTP (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File) indicates that the Execution tactic is relevant, specifically using malicious files. This technique is often used after initial access to execute malicious code, which can lead to further malicious activities such as establishing persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which aligns with the use of malicious Word documents with macros to execute the next stage loader-type malware. Execution is a logical step after initial access, as it allows the attackers to run their tools and scripts, potentially leading to persistence.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic refers to the outcomes or effects of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining access and then achieving persistence.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This is the tactic used to gain an initial foothold, which has already been accomplished according to the question.
   - **D: Persistence**: While this is the ultimate goal mentioned (achieving persistence), the question asks for the tactic that occurred before persistence was established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Lazarus group used malicious Word documents to gain initial access.
   - The next logical step after gaining access would be to execute malicious code to further their goals.
   - The provided TTP supports the use of the Execution tactic for malicious file execution.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access, the Execution tactic was used before achieving persistence.

Final Answer: A
