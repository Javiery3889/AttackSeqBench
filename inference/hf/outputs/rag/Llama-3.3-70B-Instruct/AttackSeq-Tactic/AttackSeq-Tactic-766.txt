To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Darkhotel APT gained initial access, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Darkhotel APT targets hotel guests with malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This implies a level of planning and reconnaissance to understand the targets' behaviors, preferences, and vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves masquerading as a legitimate entity to evade detection. In the context of the question, disguising malware as legitimate software updates is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a vulnerability in a web browser or its plugins when a user visits a malicious website. While not directly mentioned in the question, it's related to how initial access might be gained.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Given that the attackers knew which software updates to mimic (Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash, Windows Messenger), it suggests they had prior knowledge about their targets' likely software usage. Reconnaissance would have provided this insight.
   - **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the initial phase of targeting with disguised malware.
   - **Collection (C)**: This involves gathering data. It's more relevant after initial access has been gained.
   - **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic is about developing resources (like malware) to support operations. While relevant to the development of the malware, it doesn't directly precede the initial access in terms of tactical sequence in this context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers' ability to target specific software updates suggests prior knowledge of the targets' environment and behaviors.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering this kind of information, making it a logical precursor to the initial access tactic described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gathering information about the targets (Reconnaissance) before attempting to gain initial access through disguised malware.

Final Answer: A
