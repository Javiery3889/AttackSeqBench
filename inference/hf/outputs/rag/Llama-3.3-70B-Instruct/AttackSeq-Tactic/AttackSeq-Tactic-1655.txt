To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malicious batch file executed a PowerShell script, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious batch file executes a PowerShell script. This script downloads and extracts the main malware library DLL and other components from the Internet. The key action here is the execution of a PowerShell script, which is a method of executing code on a victim's system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the "Execution" tactic. Specifically, they mention:
   - **Tactic: Execution** with **Technique: T1059.004 (Unix Shell)** and **Technique: T1059.001 (PowerShell)**. These techniques are methods used by attackers to execute code on a compromised system. PowerShell, in particular, is a powerful tool that can be used for various malicious activities, including downloading and executing malware.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While collection might occur at some point during an attack, it doesn't directly follow the execution of a script designed to download and extract malware components.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence** - Persistence tactics are used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. After executing a script that downloads malware, an attacker might attempt to establish persistence to ensure continued access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. While credential access could be a goal of the malware, it's not the most direct consequence of executing a script to download malware components.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** - This is the tactic that has already been described in the question. The execution of the PowerShell script is an instance of the Execution tactic.

Given that the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the execution of the PowerShell script, we need to consider what typically happens next in an attack sequence after malware components have been downloaded and extracted.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The execution of the PowerShell script to download malware components is an action within the Execution tactic.
   - After the malware is downloaded and extracted, the next logical step for an attacker would be to ensure that the malware can survive system restarts or other events that might terminate the malware's process. This is where establishing **persistence** becomes crucial.

**Final Answer: B**
