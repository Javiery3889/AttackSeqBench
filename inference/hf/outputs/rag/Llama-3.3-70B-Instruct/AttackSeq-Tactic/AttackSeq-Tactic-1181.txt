To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT28 identified vulnerable systems, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 conducts IP range scans and reports scanning results to a centralized server, indicating they are looking for vulnerable systems. This action is part of the reconnaissance phase, where attackers gather information about potential targets.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are both under the Reconnaissance tactic. 
   - **T1595.001 - Scanning IP Blocks** involves scanning to identify reachable hosts.
   - **T1595.002 - Vulnerability Scanning** is about identifying vulnerabilities in systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. While collection can occur at various stages, it's not directly related to the initial identification of vulnerable systems through scanning.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials to access systems, which would typically occur after identifying vulnerable systems, not before.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network, which could be a result of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities but is not the step that directly precedes the identification of vulnerable systems through scanning.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic is about discovering information about the internal network, systems, and security measures in place. It is closely related to the reconnaissance activities described but is more focused on post-compromise activities.

Given the context, the most likely tactic to have occurred before identifying vulnerable systems through scanning would be related to gaining access to the network or system where such scanning can be performed. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred "before" the scanning, which implies we are looking for a tactic that precedes the reconnaissance activities described (scanning IP blocks and vulnerability scanning).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The described activities (scanning IP blocks and vulnerability scanning) are part of the Reconnaissance tactic, aimed at identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities.
2. For APT28 to perform these scans effectively, they would need some form of access or a starting point for their reconnaissance.
3. The Initial Access tactic provides this starting point, allowing attackers to establish a foothold from which they can begin their reconnaissance activities, including scanning for vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer**: C: Initial Access
