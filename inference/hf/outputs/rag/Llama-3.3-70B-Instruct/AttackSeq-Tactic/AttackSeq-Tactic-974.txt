To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a type of malware, has already collected information using various methods (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer). It then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to have occurred to enable communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and to exfiltrate data via FTP and WebDav servers. This implies we are looking for the tactic related to sending collected data back to the attackers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on exfiltration tactics and techniques. Specifically, T1041 refers to exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C2) channel, and T1048.003 refers to exfiltration over unencrypted, non-C2 protocols. Both are techniques under the Exfiltration tactic, indicating that the question is pointing towards how data is sent out of the compromised network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. Given that the question mentions enabling communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, this could be a strong candidate because C2 communications often involve such requests to receive commands or send back stolen data.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within a network. While important for an attacker's overall strategy, it doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data via HTTP, FTP, or WebDav.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is necessary for the initial stages of an attack, the question focuses on the exfiltration of data, not the execution of malware.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic is about gathering information. The question states that collection has already occurred (via keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer), so it's looking for what happens after collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions exfiltrating data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
   - The techniques provided (T1041 and T1048.003) are both under the Exfiltration tactic but involve different methods of exfiltration.
   - The question's context (enabling communication and exfiltrating data) suggests that the data collected is being sent back to the attackers, which is a key aspect of Command and Control (enabling communication) and directly related to Exfiltration (sending the data).
   - However, the most direct match from the provided answer choices, considering the context of sending data back (exfiltration) and the techniques mentioned, is related to how the data is communicated back to the attackers, which is a part of Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A**
