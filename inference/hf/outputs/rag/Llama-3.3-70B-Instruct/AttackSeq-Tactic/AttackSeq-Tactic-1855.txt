To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the BLACKGEAR campaign enhanced its ability to target Japanese users, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the BLACKGEAR campaign enhancing its ability to target Japanese users by crafting fake documents in the target's native language. This implies that the attackers had to first understand or discover the language used by their targets to effectively craft these documents.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614.001-System Language Discovery**: This TTP suggests that an attacker is trying to discover the system language of the target. This could be relevant because knowing the system language would help in crafting documents in the target's native language.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access to a system. While this could be a method used by the BLACKGEAR campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the enhancement of targeting capabilities based on language.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The key detail in the question is the enhancement of targeting capabilities by crafting documents in the target's native language. This implies a need for prior knowledge or discovery of the target's language.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)** is the tactic most closely related to gathering information about the target, which would include discovering the target's language. This tactic involves gathering information to plan an attack, which aligns with the need to know the target's language before crafting fake documents.
   - **Initial Access (A)** is about gaining an initial foothold into a system, which doesn't directly relate to the preparation or planning phase of understanding the target's language.
   - **Impact (B)** refers to the tactics used to disrupt or destroy systems and data, which is not relevant to the preparation phase of crafting targeted documents.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D)** involves increasing privileges within a system, which also doesn't directly relate to the planning phase of understanding the target's language.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question implies a need for prior knowledge of the target's language to enhance the campaign's effectiveness.
   - The related TTPs suggest that discovering the system language is a relevant technique.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which would include language.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that **Reconnaissance** occurred before the campaign enhanced its ability to target Japanese users.

Final Answer: C
