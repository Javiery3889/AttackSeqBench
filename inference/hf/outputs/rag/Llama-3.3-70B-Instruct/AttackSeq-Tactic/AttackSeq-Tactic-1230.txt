To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the V1 server connected to V2's SMB service, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a server (V1) connects to another server (V2) using SMB (Server Message Block) service to perform sensitive operations. This action is part of lateral movement within a compromised network, indicating that the attacker has already gained access to the network and is now moving laterally to expand their control or gather more information.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Lateral Movement" as the tactic, with techniques including "T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services" and "T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares". These techniques suggest that the attacker is exploiting remote services (possibly vulnerabilities in services like SMB) to move laterally within the network. The use of SMB/Windows Admin Shares indicates the attacker is leveraging shared administrative resources to facilitate this movement.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While collection might occur during lateral movement, it doesn't directly relate to the action of connecting to an SMB service to perform operations.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: Similar to collection, reconnaissance is about gathering information, often before or during the initial stages of an attack. It's less directly related to the act of lateral movement using SMB services.
   - **C: Execution**: Execution involves carrying out malicious code or commands on a target system. This could be a part of lateral movement but doesn't specifically address the initial step of gaining access to the network or the specific tactic that would precede connecting to an SMB service.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial breach or entry point into a network. Given that lateral movement is occurring, it implies the attacker has already gained initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes lateral movement, which implies the attacker has already gained access to the network.
   - The use of SMB services for lateral movement suggests the attacker is leveraging existing network services to move between systems.
   - Before connecting to V2's SMB service, the attacker must have already gained access to the network (Initial Access) to be in a position to perform lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D**
