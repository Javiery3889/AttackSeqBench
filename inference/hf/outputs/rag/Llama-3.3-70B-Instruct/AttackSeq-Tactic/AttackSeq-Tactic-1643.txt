To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before SideCopy gained initial access, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where SideCopy, a threat actor, gains initial access through malicious LNK files and a complex infection chain involving HTAs (HTML Applications) and loader DLLs. This indicates a sophisticated initial access method, possibly involving social engineering or exploitation of vulnerabilities.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This involves executing malicious files, which aligns with the use of malicious LNK files and loader DLLs.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This could be relevant if the initial access involved compromising a supply chain, but the question does not directly indicate this.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL, which is consistent with the loader DLLs mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network, which would occur after initial access, not before.
   - **B: Credential Access**: While credential access could be a goal of the attack, it doesn't necessarily precede initial access in all cases and isn't directly implied by the use of malicious files and DLLs for initial access.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing resources (like malware) to be used in attacks. While relevant to the attack lifecycle, it's more about preparation than the immediate precursor to initial access.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack, which could include identifying vulnerabilities or potential entry points. Given the complexity of the initial access method (involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs), it's plausible that some form of reconnaissance occurred to identify how to craft an effective initial access vector.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur before gaining initial access through a complex method.
   - Initial access tactics like the one described (using malicious files and DLLs) often follow some form of planning or information gathering to be effective.
   - Reconnaissance (D) is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target environment, which would logically precede the development and deployment of a tailored initial access method.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that some form of reconnaissance occurred to inform the initial access method used by SideCopy.

Final Answer: D
