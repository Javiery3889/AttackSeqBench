To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Fox Kitten Campaign conducted reconnaissance activities but before gaining access to the networks, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of events where the Fox Kitten Campaign has already conducted reconnaissance activities. This means the initial phase of gathering information about potential targets has been completed. The next step in the attack sequence involves gaining access to the target networks, but the question asks for the tactic that likely occurred before this access was gained, specifically through exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access** with **Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a network. This is relevant because the question mentions exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services, which can be considered public-facing applications.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance** with **Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**, which involves gathering information about targets, including credentials. However, the question states that reconnaissance has already been conducted.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Reconnaissance (B)** has already been conducted according to the question, so it's not the answer we're looking for.
   - **Initial Access (A)** is the tactic that involves exploiting public-facing applications (like VPN services) to gain access to a network, which aligns with the method used to gain access mentioned in the question.
   - **Resource Development (C)** is about developing and obtaining resources, such as infrastructure or tools, necessary for operations. While this could potentially occur before exploiting vulnerabilities, it's not directly implied in the sequence provided.
   - **Collection (D)** involves gathering information, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase or could occur at various stages of an attack, but it doesn't directly relate to the act of exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given that reconnaissance has already occurred, we're looking for the tactic that precedes the exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial access.
   - The exploitation of 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services to gain access is a direct action that follows the initial reconnaissance and likely involves developing or utilizing specific resources or tools (like exploits) to achieve.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the tactic most likely to occur after reconnaissance but before gaining access through exploiting vulnerabilities. Since **Resource Development (C)** involves preparing the means (e.g., exploits, infrastructure) to conduct the attack, including exploiting vulnerabilities, it fits as the intermediate step between reconnaissance and initial access.

**Final Answer: C**
