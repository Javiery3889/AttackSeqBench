To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers, after establishing communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers using RC4-encrypted HTTP requests, use this connection to upload files from infected machines. The key elements here are the establishment of C&C communication and the action of uploading files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control, specifically using web protocols (T1071.001) for communication and symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) for encryption. These are techniques used within the Command and Control tactic to maintain communication between the compromised system and the C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities or using other techniques to gain higher privileges on a system. While important for many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the action of uploading files via an established C&C channel.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers, which aligns with the scenario of using an established connection for uploading files. The techniques mentioned (web protocols and symmetric cryptography) are directly related to this tactic.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system or network. The scenario described assumes access has already been gained, and communication with C&C servers is established.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from a system. While uploading files could be part of exfiltration, the context provided focuses on the communication method rather than the data theft itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes an established communication channel with C&C servers.
   - The action of uploading files is a common aspect of Command and Control, as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or upload additional malware.
   - The techniques mentioned (using web protocols and symmetric cryptography) are directly related to maintaining this communication.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate tactic related to the described action, given the context of established communication and the use of specific techniques for C&C, is Command and Control.

Final Answer: B
