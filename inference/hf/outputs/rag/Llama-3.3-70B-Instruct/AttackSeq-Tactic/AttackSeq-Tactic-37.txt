To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described actions, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection and uses a DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk. This already points towards techniques related to evading detection and executing code.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs mention the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1059.001-PowerShell". This technique is specifically about using PowerShell to execute code, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. The use of PowerShell to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk directly falls under execution tactics, as it involves running code on a system.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: While operating in memory to avoid detection is a defense evasion technique, the question asks for the tactic that occurred "after" the script avoided detection, suggesting we're looking for what happened as a result of or following the evasion, not the evasion itself.
   - **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to credentials. The scenario described does not directly imply obtaining credentials.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the adversary's command and control server. While executing files could be part of setting up command and control, the primary focus of the scenario is on the execution of code, not establishing a command and control channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes using PowerShell to execute code in memory, which directly relates to the "Execution" tactic.
   - The use of DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk further supports the execution tactic, as it's a method to run code on a system.
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the described actions, and considering the provided TTPs, the focus is on the execution of code.
   
Final Answer: C
