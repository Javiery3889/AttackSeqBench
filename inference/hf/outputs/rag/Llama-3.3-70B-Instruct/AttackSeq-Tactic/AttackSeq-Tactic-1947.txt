To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers compromised a server to distribute a trojaned software update. This action is a form of initial access (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain) where the attackers exploit the trust in software updates to gain initial access to the target systems. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial compromise but before establishing communication with the command and control server, with the goal of avoiding detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels. This suggests the use of multiple channels for command and control, which could be relevant after initial access.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain. This is the method used for the initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This involves stealing data, which is not directly related to the actions described before establishing command and control.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to evade detection, which aligns with the goal of avoiding detection after the initial compromise and before establishing command and control.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This involves moving within a network, which might not be directly relevant to the specific action of avoiding detection right after initial access via a software update compromise.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: While establishing command and control is the ultimate goal, the question asks for the tactic before this step, focusing on avoiding detection.

Given the context, **Defense Evasion (B)** is the most plausible tactic. The attackers would likely attempt to evade detection after compromising the system and before establishing a command and control channel, especially since they are exploiting trust in software updates, a method that could raise suspicions if not properly concealed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers initially compromise a server to distribute a trojaned software update, exploiting the trust in software updates.
   - The goal is to avoid detection after this initial access but before establishing command and control.
   - Defense evasion techniques are used to avoid detection by various means, such as hiding malicious activity or disguising it as legitimate traffic.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic in this scenario is Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: B
