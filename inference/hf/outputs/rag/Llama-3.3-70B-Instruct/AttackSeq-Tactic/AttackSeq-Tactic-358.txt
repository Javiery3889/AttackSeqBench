To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SombRAT backdoor, associated with the CostaRicto Campaign, has established communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. This communication is facilitated through protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next for transferring the collected data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (use of protocol tunneling and DNS for C2 communication) and Exfiltration (exfiltration over a C2 channel). These TTPs indicate methods used by attackers to maintain communication with compromised systems and to extract data from those systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up C2 infrastructure. While related to the initial setup, it doesn't directly involve the transfer of collected data.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers. The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP falls under this category, but the question asks about transferring collected data, not just maintaining control.
   - **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attackers. Given that the C2 channel is already established, using this channel for exfiltration (as indicated by T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is a logical next step for transferring collected data.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic is about moving within a network to expand access. While important in many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the transfer of collected data out of the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that communication with C2 servers has been established, indicating that the attackers have control over the compromised system.
   - The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication suggests that the attackers are leveraging these channels for command and control purposes.
   - The next logical step, given the context of transferring collected data, would be to use the established C2 channel for exfiltration, as this is a common method for transferring data out of a compromised network without being detected.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the established communication and the goal of transferring collected data, points towards exfiltration as the next tactic.

Final Answer: C
