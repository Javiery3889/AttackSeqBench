To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through spear phishing but before the infected device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing to maintain access, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where APT35 has already gained initial access to a corporate device via spear phishing. This is a technique used by attackers to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links that lead to malware infection. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this initial access but before the establishment of persistent Command and Control (C2) beaconing, which is a method used by attackers to maintain access to the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic. Specifically, they mention:
   - T1091: Replication Through Removable Media (not directly relevant to the spear phishing initial access method described).
   - T1566.002: Spearphishing Link.
   - T1566.001: Spearphishing Attachment.
   
   These TTPs confirm the initial access vector (spear phishing) but do not directly inform us about the subsequent steps after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to evade detection. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most direct next step after initial access and before establishing C2.
   - **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It's a plausible next step after initial access, as attackers often seek to expand their foothold within the network before establishing persistent C2.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. After gaining initial access, an attacker would likely want to understand the environment they are in, which could include discovering network resources, user accounts, and potential vulnerabilities. This is a logical step before attempting to move laterally or establish persistent C2.
   - **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the target, such as data destruction or denial of service. It's less likely to be the immediate next step after initial access and before C2 establishment, as the attacker would typically want to secure their access and gather information before causing impact.

Given the context, after initial access through spear phishing, an attacker would likely seek to understand their environment (**Discovery**) before attempting to establish persistent C2 or move laterally. Discovery would provide the necessary information for the attacker to decide the best approach for maintaining access and furthering their goals within the network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is achieved through spear phishing.
2. The next logical step involves understanding the environment to plan further actions.
3. Discovery (C) is the tactic that aligns with this need for environmental awareness and planning.

**Final Answer: C**
