To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial infiltration and before credential gathering, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where Buckeye uses spear-phishing emails with malicious .zip attachments to gain initial access to the victim's network. After this initial access, they gather credentials using tools like keyloggers and Lazagne. We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically the technique of spear-phishing with attachments (T1566.001). This confirms that the initial step of the attack involved gaining access through phishing.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This is the tactic used to gain entry into the network, which has already occurred according to the question.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to evade detection, which could happen at various stages of the attack but isn't directly implied as the next step after initial access and before credential gathering.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, which doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving within the network to other systems or areas, which is a plausible next step after initial access and before attempting to gather credentials, as it would allow the attackers to reach areas where credentials might be more accessible or valuable.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have gained initial access through spear-phishing.
   - The next logical step would be to move within the network to find valuable targets for credential gathering.
   - Lateral movement would facilitate reaching systems or areas with the desired credentials.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after initial access and before credential gathering is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: D**
