To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved before establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers, specifically focusing on the use of targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables. This scenario implies an initial stage of an attack where the attacker is trying to gain access to the target system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment. This technique involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content, aiming to trick the recipient into opening or executing the attachment, thereby granting the attacker initial access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker obtaining resources, such as buying domains or setting up infrastructure, which doesn't directly relate to the initial contact with the target via emails.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about evading detection by the target's security measures, which might occur after initial access but doesn't directly involve the initial method of gaining access.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic directly involves the methods used by an attacker to initially gain access to a system or network. The use of targeted emails with malicious attachments (Spearphishing Attachment) is a common technique under this tactic.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions after gaining access, focusing on the effects they want to achieve within the system, such as data theft, denial of service, etc.

Given the context of using targeted emails with ZIP file attachments containing disguised executables to gain initial access, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic is **Initial Access**, as it aligns with the technique of Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) provided in the related TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an initial stage of an attack.
   - The use of targeted emails with malicious attachments is a known technique for gaining initial access.
   - The related TTPs support this by mentioning Initial Access as a tactic and Spearphishing Attachment as a technique.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gaining **Initial Access** through such methods.

Final Answer: C
