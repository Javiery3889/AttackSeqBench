To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an implant that has already been active, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and spying on applications. This indicates that the initial access and possibly some level of execution or establishment of a foothold within the system have already occurred. The next step involves communication with hardcoded server addresses through remote thread injection, which suggests a method of maintaining control and potentially exfiltrating data or receiving further commands.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1056.001 - Keylogging**. This is directly related to the actions described in the question (logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots), indicating that the attacker is in the process of collecting sensitive information.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, also with the technique **T1056.001 - Keylogging**. This shows that keylogging is not just for general data collection but also aimed at obtaining credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Execution**: While execution is a critical tactic for getting the implant to run and perform its functions, the question seems to imply that the implant is already active and executing its tasks (logging keystrokes, etc.). The next step described (communication with hardcoded server addresses) doesn't directly align with the execution tactic.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold into the system. Given that the implant is already active and performing tasks, initial access has likely already occurred.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for command and control between the attacker and the compromised system. The mention of communication with hardcoded server addresses through remote thread injection fits well within this tactic, as it describes a method for the implant to receive commands or send back collected data.
   - **D: Collection**: While collection is indeed happening (as evidenced by the keylogging and screenshot capture), the specific action of communicating with hardcoded server addresses through remote thread injection seems more aligned with maintaining control and potentially receiving further instructions rather than the act of collecting data itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The implant's activities (keylogging, screenshot capture) indicate that the collection of data is ongoing.
   - The next step of communicating with hardcoded server addresses suggests the need for command and control, to either receive further instructions or exfiltrate the collected data.
   - Given the context, the most likely next tactic in the sequence described is related to maintaining communication and control.

Final Answer: C
