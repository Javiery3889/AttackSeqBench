To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gathered network information using tools like ADFind (for Active Directory reconnaissance) and port scanning. After this initial reconnaissance, they propagated beacons to other systems within the company's network. The question asks us to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next in this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the Discovery tactic. Specifically, they involve:
   - **T1018: Remote System Discovery**, which is about discovering systems on the network that are accessible.
   - **T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery**, which involves gathering information about the network configuration, such as how systems are connected and configured.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. Given that the attackers have already used ADFind and port scanning, they have likely completed the initial discovery phase. Propagating beacons to other systems suggests they are moving beyond mere discovery.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on a target system. While executing code is a critical step in many attacks, the act of propagating beacons itself doesn't necessarily imply code execution on the target systems at this stage; it's more about establishing a presence or control.
   - **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves evading detection by the target's defensive systems. While defense evasion is crucial for attackers, the act of propagating beacons to other systems within the network doesn't directly imply evasion techniques at this point.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network, often to expand access and control. Propagating beacons to other systems fits well within this tactic, as it suggests the attackers are attempting to spread their influence and potentially gain access to more systems within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already performed initial reconnaissance using ADFind and port scanning.
   - The next logical step after gathering network information would be to use that information to spread their presence within the network.
   - Propagating beacons to other systems is a method of spreading influence and potentially gaining access to more systems, which aligns with the definition of Lateral Movement.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: D
