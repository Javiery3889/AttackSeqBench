To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described activities, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign has already utilized specific techniques (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) through the SombRAT backdoor. These techniques are used to gather information about the target system. The information gathered is then archived using a custom storage file format. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the "Discovery" tactic. Specifically, T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) are mentioned, both of which fall under the "Discovery" tactic. These techniques are used to gather information about the system and its processes.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Given that the CostaRicto Campaign is already utilizing a backdoor (SombRAT) to perform discoveries, initial access has likely already been achieved.
   - **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering data, which aligns with the actions described (using the backdoor to discover and archive system information). The fact that they are archiving gathered information suggests they are collecting data for potential future use.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources that can be used to support operations. While the use of a custom storage file format could be seen as resource development, the primary focus described is on the discovery and collection of information.
   - **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the system, its components, and its security controls. The described actions (process discovery, system information discovery, system time discovery) are all part of the discovery tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after these discoveries.

Given the context, the CostaRicto Campaign has already performed discovery activities. The act of archiving the gathered information using a custom storage file format suggests that they are collecting and potentially preparing this information for use, which aligns more closely with the **Collection** tactic. Collection is about gathering and organizing data that can be used for various purposes, including planning future attacks or exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the primary actions described: Discovery techniques are used, and information is archived.
2. Determine the purpose of these actions: The purpose appears to be gathering and organizing system information.
3. Evaluate the answer choices based on the ATT&CK framework:
   - Initial Access is likely already achieved.
   - Collection aligns with the archiving and potential future use of the gathered information.
   - Resource Development might be a secondary aspect but doesn't directly relate to the primary actions described.
   - Discovery is what has been done, not what comes after.

**Final Answer**: B
