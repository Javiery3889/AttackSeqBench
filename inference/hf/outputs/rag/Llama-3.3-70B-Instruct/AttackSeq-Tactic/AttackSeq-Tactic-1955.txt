To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where after surveying the victim's computer and sending specific information to a remote server, OceanLotus uses a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443. This suggests that the attackers are establishing a communication channel with the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2). Specifically, they mention the use of non-standard ports (T1571) and non-application layer protocols (T1095) for C2 communication. This indicates that the attackers are using unconventional methods to communicate with the compromised system, likely to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system or network. While the initial surveying of the victim's computer fits into discovery, the use of a custom binary protocol for communication suggests a step beyond mere discovery.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic is about the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. The described actions do not directly imply disruption or manipulation but rather setting up a communication channel.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on a specific port (in this case, TCP port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS but can be used for other encrypted communications) aligns with establishing a secure and potentially covert C2 channel.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic is about stealing data from the system. While sending system information to a remote server could be part of exfiltration, the focus on using a custom protocol for communication suggests setting up a channel that could be used for various purposes, including but not limited to exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gathered initial information and are now setting up a communication channel.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with encryption and a specific port indicates an effort to establish a secure and possibly covert channel.
   - This action is most closely related to establishing Command and Control, as it enables the attackers to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system securely.
   - Therefore, the most likely next tactic in the sequence described is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
