To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor payload, after being delivered through obfuscated macro scripts, begins communicating with a specific URL (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) to send and receive commands. The key elements here are the communication with a command and control (C2) server and the use of obfuscation for payload delivery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for communication between the compromised system and the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This suggests the execution of malicious files, which could include the backdoor payload.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This implies methods used to evade defenses by deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the obfuscation methods mentioned in the question for delivering the macro scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is relevant due to the use of obfuscation for the macro scripts, the question specifically asks about the communication with the C2 server, not the evasion techniques used for delivery.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This choice directly aligns with the scenario described, where the backdoor communicates with a C2 server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) to send and receive commands. The related TTP (T1071.001-Web Protocols) supports this, as it involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**: There's no information in the question suggesting that privilege escalation occurred or was necessary for the communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: Initial access refers to the initial entry point of an adversary into a network. The scenario described involves communication post-initial access, as the backdoor is already delivered and active.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the communication between the delivered backdoor payload and a C2 server.
   - The use of obfuscation for macro scripts is a precursor to this communication but is not the primary action described.
   - The related TTPs support the notion of C2 communication via web protocols.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for the described action is Command and Control, as it directly involves sending and receiving commands between the compromised system and the C2 server.

Final Answer: B
