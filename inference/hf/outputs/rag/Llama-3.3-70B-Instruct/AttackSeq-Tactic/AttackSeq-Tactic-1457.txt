To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the JavaScript dropper Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and before the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions where a JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) is used to fingerprint an infected system. This involves executing commands and saving the output to a temporary file. After this action, we are looking for a tactic that precedes the communication of the KopiLuwak backdoor with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control communications, which aligns with the KopiLuwak backdoor's method of communication.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This refers to the execution of JavaScript code, which is relevant to the initial action of the JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) executing commands on the infected system.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which is what the JavaScript dropper does initially. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after this execution and before the backdoor's communication.
   - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system or network. The action of the JavaScript dropper fingerprinting the system fits into this category, as it involves executing commands to gather system information.
   - **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic is about evading detection by security controls. While important, the described sequence does not directly imply evasion techniques between the system fingerprinting and the backdoor's communication.
   - **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering data, which could be a part of the system fingerprinting process. However, given the context, it seems more specific to the action of gathering information (discovery) than the broader collection of data.

Given the sequence of events:
1. The JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) executes commands and saves output to a temporary file, which is an execution and discovery action.
2. The question asks for the tactic after this execution and before the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with compromised websites.

The most plausible sequence suggests that after the initial execution (which includes discovery), the next logical step before establishing command and control (C2) communication would indeed be further **Discovery (B)**. This is because understanding the system (through fingerprinting) would help in deciding the next steps for persistence, privilege escalation, or lateral movement, which are all facilitated by a better understanding of the system and network environment.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The JavaScript dropper's action of executing commands to fingerprint the system is an initial step that involves execution and discovery.
- The question seeks the tactic following this initial step and preceding the establishment of C2 communications.
- Discovery (B) is the most fitting tactic as it aligns with the system fingerprinting action and precedes the communication phase, where the attacker would use the gathered information to facilitate further malicious activities.

**Final Answer**: B
