To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome and before tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Exploitation of a Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome**: The initial step involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain arbitrary read/write access. This action is typically associated with gaining initial access or escalating privileges within a system.

2. **Use-After-Free Condition for Arbitrary Read/Write Access**: This condition is a result of the exploitation and allows the attackers to potentially execute code or modify system settings, which could be part of privilege escalation or preparation for further malicious activities.

3. **Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the attackers used scheduled tasks for persistence, which means they installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This suggests that exploitation (like the zero-day exploit mentioned) can be used for escalating privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This shows that scheduled tasks can also be used for executing malicious code.

Given these points, the sequence of events seems to be:
- Initial exploitation for gaining access or escalating privileges.
- Using the gained access to perform further actions.
- Installing tasks for persistence.

The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the exploitation and **before** the installation of tasks for persistence. 

- **Exploitation** (for initial access or privilege escalation) has already occurred.
- **Persistence** is what is being done by installing tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler, which is mentioned as happening after the tactic in question.
- **Execution** could be a part of the process after exploitation, as the attackers would need to execute their code to achieve further goals, such as installing persistence mechanisms.
- **Defense Evasion** and **Exfiltration** are not directly implied by the given sequence of events as necessary steps between exploitation and persistence.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence suggests that after exploiting the vulnerability and before installing tasks for persistence, the attackers would need to **execute** their malicious code or commands to set up the persistence mechanism (in this case, installing tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler).

**Final Answer: A**
