To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malware components collected detailed system information, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) have collected detailed system information. This includes IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings. The collection of such detailed system information is typically an initial step in the attack lifecycle, aimed at understanding the target environment.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the network configuration of the target system, which aligns with the collection of IP addresses and platform details.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include recursive directory listings and other system information.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique is about identifying the owners or users of a system, which might not directly relate to the collection of system information like IP addresses and directory listings but is part of the broader discovery phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the malware has already collected detailed system information, we are looking for the tactic that most likely follows such an action. 
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This involves transferring data from the target system to the attacker. Given that data has been collected, exfiltration could be a logical next step to send the collected information back to the attackers.
   - **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system. While important, it doesn't directly follow from the collection of system information unless the information collected is used to establish persistence mechanisms.
   - **Collection (C)**: The question states that collection has already occurred, so while ongoing collection is possible, it's not the next distinct tactic.
   - **Discovery (D)**: Similar to collection, discovery is already in progress or has occurred based on the information given.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The collection of detailed system information is a precursor to several potential next steps, but given the context, the most direct next step after collecting such information would be to **exfiltrate** this data back to the attackers for further analysis or use.
   - The other options, while possible in the broader context of an attack, do not as directly follow the action of collecting system information as exfiltration does.

Final Answer: A
