To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after the described actions, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a VBA-Macro uses obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis and then decodes a JavaScript payload. This payload is a downloader that drops and executes a file from a URL. The key elements here are the use of obfuscation, the decoding of a JavaScript payload, and the action of downloading and executing a file.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This indicates that the attacker is trying to evade defenses by deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which aligns with the initial part of the question where the VBA-Macro decodes a JavaScript payload.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This shows the use of JavaScript for execution, which directly relates to the JavaScript payload mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This refers to the use of Visual Basic (VBA in this context) for execution, aligning with the VBA-Macro part of the question.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next after the described actions. Given that the actions involve decoding a JavaScript payload and then using it to download and execute a file, we need to consider what tactic this sequence of actions would fall under.
   - **Option A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems. While downloading and executing a file could be part of maintaining control, the primary focus of the question seems to be on the initial execution and evasion rather than ongoing command and control.
   - **Option B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to a system. The actions described (using a VBA-Macro, decoding a JavaScript payload, and downloading/executing a file) could indeed be part of gaining initial access, especially if the file being downloaded is malware or a tool used for further exploitation.
   - **Option C: Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher privileges on a system than initially granted. The described actions do not directly imply an attempt to escalate privileges but rather to execute code and potentially establish a foothold.
   - **Option D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about evading detection and defense mechanisms. The use of obfuscation and decoding techniques to execute a payload does align with defense evasion, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred next, after these evasion techniques were used.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The sequence described involves using a VBA-Macro with obfuscation to decode a JavaScript payload, which then downloads and executes a file. This sequence suggests an attempt to gain access to a system (by executing malicious code) rather than to evade defenses (which was already part of the initial action) or escalate privileges.
   - Given the focus on executing a file downloaded from a URL as a result of the decoded JavaScript payload, the most likely next tactic in the ATT&CK framework is related to gaining access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs points towards gaining **Initial Access** to the system, as this is the phase where an attacker would attempt to execute malicious code or download and install malware to establish a foothold.

Final Answer: B
