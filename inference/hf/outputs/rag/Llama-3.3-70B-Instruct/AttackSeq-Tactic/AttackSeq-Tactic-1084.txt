To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where ZeroT communicates with its command and control server via HTTP POST beacons after gaining access. It specifically mentions the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft CHM files as the initial infection vector. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers gained access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the "Initial Access" tactic, with techniques including phishing (T1566), spearphishing link (T1566.002), and spearphishing attachment (T1566.001). These techniques are methods used by attackers to gain initial access to a system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the question asks for the tactic that occurred before gaining access and mentions the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious files, we need to identify the tactic that aligns with the initial stage of an attack. The provided TTPs all relate to initial access methods, specifically phishing and its variants. The mention of spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft CHM files directly correlates with T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment), which is a technique under the "Initial Access" tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The question specifies the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious files as the method of initial infection.
    - The related TTPs highlight techniques under the "Initial Access" tactic, which includes spearphishing attachment.
    - Since the question asks for the tactic before gaining access, and given that the described action (spear-phishing) is a method of gaining initial access, the correct answer must be the tactic that encompasses these initial access techniques.
    - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before attackers gained access using spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft CHM files is "Initial Access".

Final Answer: C
