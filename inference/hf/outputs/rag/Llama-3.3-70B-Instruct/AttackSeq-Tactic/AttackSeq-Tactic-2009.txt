To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before achieving initial access through spear phishing emails. The emails were disguised as payment documents and contained compressed files with malware executables. This indicates a targeted attack where the attackers had some knowledge about the targets, suggesting a preceding phase of gathering information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention "Tactic: Initial Access" and "Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment". This technique involves sending emails with attachments that contain malicious content, which aligns with the scenario described in the question. The initial access tactic is about how attackers gain their first foothold within a network, which is exactly what the spear phishing is intended to achieve.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code within a target environment, which could be a step after initial access but doesn't necessarily precede it in the context of preparing for the spear phishing campaign.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which would be necessary for crafting targeted spear phishing emails disguised as payment documents. It makes sense that before sending such emails, the attackers would need to gather information about their targets to make the emails appear legitimate and increase the chances of success.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic is about the attacker's preparation and capability development, which might not directly relate to the specific action of sending targeted emails unless it involves developing the capability to send such emails. However, it's less directly related to the act of gathering information needed for the spear phishing campaign.
   - **D: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access within a system, which occurs after initial access has been achieved, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before achieving initial access through a targeted spear phishing campaign.
   - The spear phishing campaign involved sending emails that were tailored to appear as payment documents, indicating the attackers had prior knowledge of their targets.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of spear phishing with attachments for initial access.
   - Given the targeted nature of the attack, it's logical that the attackers first gathered information about their targets.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access, given the context, is **Reconnaissance**, as it involves gathering information that would be used to craft the targeted emails.

Final Answer: B
