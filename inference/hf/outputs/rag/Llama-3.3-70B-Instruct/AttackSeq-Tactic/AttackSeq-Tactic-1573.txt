To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious documents are used to execute malware as part of a phishing campaign. After the execution of the malware, it establishes communication with multiple Command and Control (C2) domains. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Resource Development**, with the technique **T1583.001-Domains**. This suggests the development of resources, specifically domains, which can be used for various purposes, including Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - **Tactic: Execution**, with the technique **T1204.002-Malicious File**. This indicates the execution of malicious files, which aligns with the initial step of the attack sequence described in the question, where malicious documents are used to execute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the initial entry point into a network. While phishing and executing malicious documents are methods of gaining initial access, the question asks about the step after the malware has been executed, which suggests we are past the initial access phase.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. Establishing communication with C2 domains does not directly relate to causing impact.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the adversary's C2 infrastructure. Given that the malware establishes communication with multiple C2 domains, this tactic directly aligns with the described action.
   - **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves the methods used by an adversary to maintain their presence within a network over time. While establishing C2 communication could be part of maintaining persistence, the primary focus of the described action is on the communication with C2 domains, not on maintaining access over time.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where, after initial access and execution of malware, the malware communicates with C2 domains.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of malicious files for execution and the development of resources (domains) for potential C2 operations.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK tactic after executing malware and establishing communication with C2 domains is **Command and Control**, as it directly involves the communication between the compromised system and the adversary's infrastructure.

Final Answer: C
