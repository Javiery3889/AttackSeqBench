To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Charming Kitten gained initial access to victims' accounts, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that Charming Kitten used spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gain initial access. This indicates the use of social engineering techniques to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically mentioning "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link". These techniques are directly related to how the initial access was gained, as described in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the target environment. While it could be a precursor to targeted attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation or setup needed for the spear-phishing campaign described.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves the adversary attempting to gain access to the target system or network. The question describes the method used for initial access but asks for the tactic that occurred before this.
   - **C: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system or network after initial access has been gained. It's not relevant to the preparation phase before initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining resources needed to support their operations, such as setting up infrastructure for phishing campaigns. Given that the question mentions the use of spear-phishing emails and SMS messages impersonating known services, it suggests a level of preparation and resource setup beforehand.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before gaining initial access through spear-phishing.
   - The use of spear-phishing emails and SMS messages, especially those impersonating well-known services like Google Drive, implies a level of planning and setup.
   - The "Resource Development" tactic includes setting up the necessary infrastructure and resources for such campaigns, which would logically precede the execution of the spear-phishing attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that the resources needed for the spear-phishing campaign (e.g., domain names, email accounts, SMS sending capabilities) were developed before the initial access attempt.

Final Answer: D
