To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the threat actor utilized spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial attack vector where threat actors use spear-phishing emails with spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims. This is a method used to gain initial access to a system or network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access
   - Technique: T1566 - Phishing
   - Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link

   These TTPs confirm that the initial method of compromise is indeed phishing, specifically spear-phishing via links, which falls under the "Initial Access" tactic. This tactic involves the threat actor trying to get into a network or system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **D: Initial Access** is the tactic that involves the initial breach or entry point into a system or network. Given that the question describes the use of spear-phishing emails to compromise victims, this is the tactic that is currently being described, not the one that follows.
   - **A: Execution** involves executing malicious code or commands on a compromised system. While this could potentially follow initial access, the question does not provide direct evidence that code execution has occurred as a result of the phishing attempt.
   - **B: Credential Access** involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. This tactic often follows initial access, as once an attacker has a foothold, they may attempt to gather credentials to move laterally within a network or to access sensitive data.
   - **C: Resource Development** is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure. While important, this is less directly related to the immediate next steps following initial access via phishing.

Given the context, after a threat actor gains initial access (via spear-phishing in this case), a common next step is to try to obtain **Credential Access**. This is because having credentials allows the attacker to move deeper into the network, access sensitive information, or use the compromised system as a pivot point for further attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actor uses spear-phishing to gain initial access.
   - The next logical step after gaining access would be to try to obtain more privileges or access to more systems.
   - Credential Access is a critical step for achieving these goals.

Final Answer: B
