To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Higaisa APT group used the JavaScript file to execute 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Higaisa APT group using a JavaScript file to execute a command that retrieves IP address information. This action is part of a larger operation and indicates an interest in understanding the network configuration of the target system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery". This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system, which aligns with the action of executing 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls. While defense evasion is a common tactic used by attackers, it does not directly relate to the action of gathering network configuration information.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves techniques used to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. Retrieving IP address information does not directly align with causing impact but is more about gathering information.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves techniques used to develop resources, such as establishing a command and control channel or obtaining resources to support an operation. While resource development is crucial for attackers, the specific action of retrieving IP address information is more closely related to understanding the environment.
   - **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves techniques used to gather information about the target system or network. The action of executing 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information directly aligns with system network configuration discovery, which is a technique under the Discovery tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The action described (executing 'cmd /c ipconfig') is aimed at discovering the system's network configuration.
   - The related TTPs directly mention "Discovery" as a tactic and "System Network Configuration Discovery" as a technique, which aligns with the described action.
   - Therefore, the most logical sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred before or as part of the operation to gather necessary information about the target system's network configuration.

Final Answer: D
