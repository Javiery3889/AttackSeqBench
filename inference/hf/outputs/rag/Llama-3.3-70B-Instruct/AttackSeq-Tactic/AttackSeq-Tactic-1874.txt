To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary uses a spearphishing email with an unencrypted zip file to gain initial access. It mentions that before this action, the adversary likely gathered detailed target information to enhance their attack methods. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access, given this context.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment". This indicates that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before initiating an attack. Given that the adversary had to gather detailed target information to make their spearphishing attack more effective (by making it appear as a legitimate program, for instance), reconnaissance fits as a precursor to the initial access attempt.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic refers to the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. It does not align with the preparatory phase of gathering information for an attack.
   - **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the adversary. It occurs after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: While this is the tactic that includes the technique of spearphishing, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before initial access, not the tactic that includes the initial access method itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before gaining initial access through a spearphishing email.
   - The scenario implies that the adversary needed to gather information about the target to make the spearphishing attempt successful.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which would be necessary before attempting initial access through a targeted method like spearphishing.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that reconnaissance occurred before the initial access attempt.

Final Answer: A
