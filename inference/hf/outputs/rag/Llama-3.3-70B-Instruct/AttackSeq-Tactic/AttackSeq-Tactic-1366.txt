To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Scote malware is using techniques to evade detection and then retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers. The key elements here are the evasion techniques and the establishment of communication with command and control (C2) servers through unconventional means (Pastebin, Google+).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the Command and Control tactic, specifically techniques involving dead drop resolvers (T1102.001) and web services (T1102). Dead drop resolvers are used to resolve locations where C2 instructions are hidden, and web services can be used for C2 communication. These techniques are about establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and its C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is mentioned in the question as something the malware does, the specific action of retrieving information to establish communications with its servers is not primarily about evading detection but about setting up a channel for command and control.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target environment. While the malware is retrieving information, its purpose is not to gather intel about the target but to establish communication, which doesn't fit well with reconnaissance.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the C2 servers. The action described in the question—retrieving information from Pastebin or Google+ to communicate with its servers—aligns closely with this tactic, especially considering the related TTPs provided.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: Exfiltration is about transferring data from the victim's system to the attacker. The scenario described focuses on setting up communication channels, not on transferring data out of the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware is setting up a means to communicate with its C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs point towards techniques used for Command and Control.
   - The action of retrieving information to establish these communications is a key part of maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic in this context is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
