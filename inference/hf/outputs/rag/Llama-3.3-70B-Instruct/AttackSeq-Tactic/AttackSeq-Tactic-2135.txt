To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor by APT15. This backdoor installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS for communication. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this deployment.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1071.004-DNS". This indicates that the attackers are using DNS as a means of command and control (C2) communication. The use of DNS for C2 suggests that the attackers are likely using the RoyalDNS backdoor to maintain access to the victim's network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Persistence**: While the backdoor does install persistently, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after deployment, suggesting we're looking for an action taken after persistence is established.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the creation, purchase, or compromise of resources such as infrastructure, domains, or accounts that can be used for future operations. While possible, it's not directly implied by the use of a backdoor for C2.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. The use of a backdoor for C2 doesn't directly imply privilege escalation, although it could be a subsequent step to achieve more significant control.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the removal of data from the victim's network. Given that the backdoor uses DNS for communication, it's plausible that after establishing a persistent presence (persistence), the next step would be to exfiltrate sensitive data, as the backdoor could be used to transmit data out of the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor and its use of DNS for C2 communication suggests that the attackers have established a means to issue commands to the compromised system and potentially receive data back.
   - Given the context of using a backdoor for C2, the most logical next step after establishing persistence would be to use this channel for data exfiltration, as it aligns with the common goals of APT groups like APT15 to steal sensitive information.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor is data exfiltration, as it leverages the established C2 channel for a common attack objective.

Final Answer: D
