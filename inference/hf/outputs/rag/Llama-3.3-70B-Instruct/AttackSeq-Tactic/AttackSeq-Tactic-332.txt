To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Bankshot implant has evaded detection and is communicating with control servers after being disguised as ZIP files. The key elements here are the evasion of detection, the disguise as ZIP files, and the communication with control servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation**: This suggests that the attackers are exploiting applications or systems, but it doesn't directly relate to the communication with control servers or evasion techniques.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This directly relates to the implants disguising themselves as ZIP files to evade detection, which is a form of masquerading.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While it's possible that the implants could be used for lateral movement, the question focuses on communication with control servers and evasion, not movement between systems.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. The scenario described doesn't directly imply the implants are being used for discovery; instead, they are communicating with control servers.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves evading detection by the target's defensive systems. The implants disguising themselves as ZIP files is a clear example of defense evasion, but the question also mentions communication with control servers, which is not solely about evasion.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the implant and the attacker's control servers. The implants communicating with hardcoded control servers fits this description precisely, as it involves the exchange of commands or data between the compromised system and the attacker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The implants have already evaded detection by masquerading as ZIP files, which aligns with **Defense Evasion**.
   - However, the key action described in the question is the communication with control servers, which is essential for receiving commands or sending stolen data.
   - Given the focus on communication with control servers, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic is **Command and Control**, as it directly involves the communication between the compromised system (where the implant resides) and the attacker's control servers.

Final Answer: D
