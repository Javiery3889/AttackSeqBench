To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after the stolen credentials were sent to a command and control server using standard application layer protocols, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server. This action implies that there is already an established communication channel between the compromised system and the C2 server. The use of standard application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for sending stolen credentials suggests that the attackers are leveraging common internet protocols to communicate with their C2 server, which is a technique often used for command and control purposes.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Command and Control" tactic. Specifically:
   - **T1071: Application Layer Protocol** and its sub-technique **T1071.001: Web Protocols** indicate the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
   - **T1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol** refers to using protocols that are not at the application layer (like DNS tunneling) for C2 communication.

   These TTPs suggest that the context is about how attackers communicate with their C2 servers, which is a critical aspect of maintaining control over compromised systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry point an attacker uses to gain access to a network. Given that credentials have already been stolen and sent to a C2 server, initial access has likely already occurred.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the removal of data from a system. While sending stolen credentials to a C2 server could be considered a form of exfiltration, the question specifically asks about the next step after this action, in the context of ATT&CK tactics.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers' C2 server. Given that the stolen credentials were sent using standard application layer protocols, this action is directly related to establishing or maintaining command and control.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. Since the question states that credentials have already been stolen and sent to a C2 server, the focus has moved beyond just accessing credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question context and related TTPs clearly indicate that the action of sending stolen credentials to a C2 server is part of command and control operations.
   - Given that the credentials have been sent, the next logical step in the attack sequence, based on the ATT&CK framework, would be to use these credentials or the established C2 channel for further malicious activities, which still falls under the broader category of command and control, as it involves using the compromised system or credentials for the attackers' purposes.
   
Final Answer: C
