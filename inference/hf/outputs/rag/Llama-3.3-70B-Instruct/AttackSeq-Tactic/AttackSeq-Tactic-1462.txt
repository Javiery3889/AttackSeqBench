To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors execute BlackEnergy 3 malware on targeted employee workstations. The malware is delivered through weaponized MS Office documents that exploit the employees' enabling of macros. This implies that the initial step involved getting the malware into the system, which is often associated with gaining access to the system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1204.002 - Malicious File," which refers to the use of malicious files to execute malicious code. This technique is part of the execution tactic, indicating that the focus is on how the malware was run on the system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow the adversary to maintain their presence on the system. While persistence is crucial for long-term access, it doesn't directly relate to the initial execution of malware.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves techniques used to gain initial access to a system or network. Given that the threat actors used weaponized documents to exploit enabled macros, this suggests they needed a way to get the malware into the system, which aligns with initial access tactics.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection. While defense evasion is likely used throughout the attack, it doesn't directly describe the action of getting the malware to run initially.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic is about executing the malware, which is what happened when the BlackEnergy 3 malware was run. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors used weaponized MS Office documents with macros enabled to deliver the malware.
   - This action implies that the initial step was to gain access to the system, which is necessary before executing the malware.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of the malware is gaining initial access to the system.

Final Answer: B
