To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after NanHaiShu used techniques such as base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation by NanHaiShu. These techniques are used to hinder detection of a decoy XLS and JScript file. This implies that the attacker is trying to evade detection, which is a key aspect of the Defense Evasion tactic.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided all fall under the Defense Evasion tactic. Specifically, they include:
   - T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File, which aligns with the use of base64 encoding.
   - T1027.010: Command Obfuscation, which could relate to the layered URL string obfuscation.
   - T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information, which is a broader technique that encompasses both encoding and obfuscation methods to hide files or information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: Given that all the related TTPs are categorized under Defense Evasion and the question describes actions (base64 encoding and URL string obfuscation) aimed at evading detection, it suggests that the primary goal of these actions is to avoid being detected by security measures. This directly aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation is a clear indicator of attempting to evade detection.
   - These techniques are specifically mentioned as part of the Defense Evasion tactic in the related TTPs.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these evasion techniques were used, implying we are looking for a tactic that follows or is closely related to these evasion methods.
   - Since the techniques used are already part of Defense Evasion, and considering the context of evading detection to possibly maintain access or move further within a system, the most logical next step or related tactic would still be focused on evasion, as the primary goal is to remain undetected.

**Final Answer: D**
