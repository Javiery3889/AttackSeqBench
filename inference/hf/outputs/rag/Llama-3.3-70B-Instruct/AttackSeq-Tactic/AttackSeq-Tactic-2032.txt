To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker is using a stealthy implant in memory for defense evasion. This implies the attacker is already inside the network and is taking steps to avoid detection. Before moving on to host enumeration or network information gathering for data exfiltration, the attacker uses a hardcoded URL to retrieve payloads for execution. This action suggests a communication mechanism between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the tactic of Defense Evasion, which involves techniques used by attackers to evade detection and bypass security controls. The techniques mentioned include:
   - **T1480.001 - Environmental Keying**: This involves using specific conditions or environmental factors to trigger certain malicious behaviors, which could be part of how the implant operates in memory.
   - **T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about making encoded or obfuscated data readable and usable, possibly relevant to how payloads are handled.
   - **T1027.009 - Embedded Payloads**: This involves embedding payloads within other files or programs, which could relate to how the implant operates and retrieves additional payloads.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While lateral movement might occur after initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to using a hardcoded URL to retrieve payloads.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 infrastructure. Using a hardcoded URL to retrieve payloads fits well within this tactic, as it involves communicating with the C2 server to fetch additional malicious code.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information relevant to the attacker's objectives. While collection does occur in the scenario described (host enumeration, network information gathering), it doesn't directly involve the use of hardcoded URLs for payload retrieval.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic is about the attacker's actions to disrupt, corrupt, or destroy data and systems. The scenario described doesn't directly imply actions aimed at causing impact but rather at preparing for potential exfiltration or further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes an action (using a hardcoded URL to retrieve payloads) that occurs after defense evasion and before collection or exfiltration activities.
   - The use of a hardcoded URL for payload retrieval is a method of communicating with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - This action aligns most closely with establishing and maintaining communication for the purpose of executing additional malicious code.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred, involving the use of a hardcoded URL to retrieve payloads for execution, is Command and Control.

Final Answer: B
