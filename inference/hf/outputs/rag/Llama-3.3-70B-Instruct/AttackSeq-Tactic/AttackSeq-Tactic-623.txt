To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after obtaining valid credentials for lateral movement but before the collection of relevant data. The focus is on locating relevant systems, users, and data within the target network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This involves using domain accounts to maintain access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts to gain initial access.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This involves gathering information about credentials.

   These TTPs suggest activities related to gaining and maintaining access, as well as reconnaissance, but the question specifically asks about locating relevant systems, users, and data after gaining access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is mentioned as already accomplished ("after obtaining valid credentials").
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: While lateral movement is mentioned in the context of the question, it's more about moving within the network rather than locating relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, and its components. It aligns with the goal of locating relevant systems, users, and data after gaining access.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic is about gathering data, which is mentioned as the next step after the one in question ("prior to the collection of relevant data").

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies a sequence where the attacker has already obtained valid credentials for lateral movement.
   - The goal is to identify the tactic used to locate relevant systems, users, and data before collecting data.
   - **Discovery (C)** is the tactic that directly involves exploring and understanding the network, its systems, and data, which fits the described sequence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described points towards the **Discovery** tactic as the answer.

Final Answer: C
