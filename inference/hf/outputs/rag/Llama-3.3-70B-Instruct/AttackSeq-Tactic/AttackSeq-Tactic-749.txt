To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Gamaredon injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents and used its Outlook VBA macro to send emails with malicious attachments, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Gamaredon, has already gained access to a system and is using malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, as well as an Outlook VBA macro, to further their attack. This implies that the initial access to the system has already been achieved.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This indicates the use of Visual Basic for execution, which aligns with the use of VBA macros for malicious purposes.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This suggests that the initial access was likely gained through spearphishing with a malicious attachment, which is a common method for delivering malware or gaining initial access to a system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: Execution**: While execution is indeed a part of the attack (as the malicious macros are being executed), the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the injection of malicious macros. Execution is more aligned with the action of running the malicious code rather than the step before it.
   - **Option B: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. While it's a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, the question implies that the attacker has already gained access and is now acting on that access, making reconnaissance less likely to be the immediate precursor.
   - **Option C: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving within a network to gain access to additional systems or data. The scenario described involves using compromised systems to send emails to other targets within the same organization, which could imply movement or action within the network, but the primary focus is on using the already compromised system to spread, not necessarily moving to new systems.
   - **Option D: Discovery**: Discovery involves identifying systems, data, or other assets within the target environment. Given that the attacker has already gained access and is now using the system to spread malicious emails and inject macros, it's plausible that some form of discovery (e.g., identifying reachable Word and Excel documents, understanding the email system) occurred before these actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access, likely through spearphishing.
   - The use of malicious macros and sending emails with malicious attachments suggests the attacker has a level of understanding of the system and its capabilities.
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to have occurred **before** these actions, which involves using the system's capabilities to further the attack.
   - Given the context, **Reconnaissance (B)** seems the most fitting as it involves gathering information that would be necessary for the subsequent actions (e.g., understanding the network, identifying potential targets within the organization, knowing where to inject macros for maximum effect). However, considering the specifics of the question and the typical flow of an attack, **Discovery (D)** could also be a strong candidate because it directly relates to identifying and understanding the environment in which the attacker is operating, which would be necessary before executing the described actions.

However, considering the typical sequence of events in an attack and the specifics provided, **Reconnaissance (B)** is often more about gathering information before gaining access or very early in the process, whereas **Discovery (D)** fits well with the idea of exploring the environment after initial access to plan the next steps, such as where and how to inject malicious macros and who to target with emails.

Given the context and focusing on the action described (injecting macros and sending emails), the most appropriate choice seems to be **Discovery (D)**, as it aligns with the phase of understanding the environment to execute such targeted actions.

**Final Answer: D**
