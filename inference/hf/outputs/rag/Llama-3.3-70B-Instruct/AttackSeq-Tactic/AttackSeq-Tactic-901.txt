To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already evaded defenses using techniques like DLL side-loading to launch malicious payloads. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next to allow PKPLUG (a piece of malware) to communicate with and control compromised systems. This implies we are looking for a tactic that involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Defense Evasion" and the technique "T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading". This technique is used to evade defenses by loading malicious DLLs that are then executed by legitimate processes, thereby masking the malicious activity. This information confirms that the initial step of evading defenses has been accomplished.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow malware to maintain its presence on a system between restarts or to survive other interruptions. While important for long-term control, it doesn't directly relate to communicating with or controlling compromised systems in real-time.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic has already been utilized, as indicated by the use of DLL side-loading. It's about evading detection, not establishing control or communication.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or applications. While it could be a part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly enable communication with compromised systems.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 infrastructure. This would allow PKPLUG to receive commands and exfiltrate data, fitting the description of what is needed to "communicate with and control compromised systems".

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that follows defense evasion and enables communication and control of compromised systems.
   - Defense evasion (B) has already been achieved through DLL side-loading.
   - Persistence (A) and Credential Access (C) are important but do not directly enable real-time communication and control.
   - Command and Control (D) is the tactic that directly addresses the need for communication and control of compromised systems.

Final Answer: D
