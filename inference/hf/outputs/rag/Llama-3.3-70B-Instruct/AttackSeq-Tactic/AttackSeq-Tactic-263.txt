To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used Defense Evasion techniques and before they employed Discovery techniques, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using Defense Evasion techniques (specifically Indicator Removal on Host, which is related to T1070), the attackers then moved on to employ Discovery techniques like Process Discovery. This indicates a progression in the attack where the attackers first tried to evade detection and then sought to understand the environment better.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion as a tactic and Indicator Removal (T1070) as a technique. This suggests the attackers were trying to hide their tracks or avoid being detected by removing indicators that could lead to their discovery.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: This is mentioned as a subsequent action (using Process Discovery), so it's unlikely to be the answer since we're looking for what happened before Discovery.
   - **Persistence (B)**: After evading defenses, establishing persistence would be a logical next step to ensure continued access to the compromised system before moving on to discover more about the network.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which could be part of the initial compromise but doesn't directly fit as a bridge between defense evasion and discovery in this context.
   - **Credential Access (D)**: While obtaining credentials could be a goal, it's not directly implied as the next step after defense evasion and before discovery in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first used Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - The next logical step would be to ensure they can maintain access to the system without being detected, which aligns with **Persistence**.
   - After establishing persistence, they would then seek to understand the network and system better through **Discovery** techniques like Process Discovery.

**Final Answer: B**
