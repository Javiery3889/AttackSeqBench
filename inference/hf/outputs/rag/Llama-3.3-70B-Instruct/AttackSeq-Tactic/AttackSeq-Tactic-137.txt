To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FamousSparrow executed SparrowDoor on compromised systems but before they attempted to evade detection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by FamousSparrow, starting with the execution of SparrowDoor on compromised systems. This execution utilized cmd.exe and exploited vulnerabilities, indicating an initial access and execution phase. The question then mentions an attempt to evade detection by injecting encrypted shellcode (MpSvc.dll) into processes, which is a defense evasion technique.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This suggests that the attackers used process injection to potentially escalate privileges, which is a common step after initial access to gain more control over the system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection**: This indicates the use of process injection to evade detection, aligning with the latter part of the question.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which aligns with the initial action of executing SparrowDoor. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this execution.
   - **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system. While persistence mechanisms might be established after initial execution, the specific actions described (executing SparrowDoor and then evading detection) don't directly imply persistence as the immediate next step.
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system and its environment. While discovery can occur at various stages of an attack, the actions described don't directly suggest that discovery is the immediate next step after execution and before evasion.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question, which focus on execution and evasion rather than developing resources for the attack.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence suggests that after executing SparrowDoor (Execution), the attackers would likely attempt to **escalate their privileges** to move laterally or gain more control over the system before attempting to evade detection. The mention of process injection (T1055) in both related TTPs supports this, as it can be used for both privilege escalation and defense evasion. However, since the question asks for the tactic before evasion and after execution, and considering the provided options, **Privilege Escalation** is not listed as an option but is closely related to the actions described. Among the given choices, **Discovery (A)** is the closest in the sequence that could logically occur after initial execution and before evasion, as understanding the system (discovery) could precede attempts to evade detection more effectively.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial execution of SparrowDoor using cmd.exe and vulnerabilities.
2. A need for the attackers to understand the system better or establish a stronger foothold, which could involve discovery or other tactics not explicitly listed.
3. Attempt to evade detection by injecting encrypted shellcode into processes.

**Final Answer**: A
