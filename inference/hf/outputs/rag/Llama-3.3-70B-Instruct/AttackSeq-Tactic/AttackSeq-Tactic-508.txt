To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the observed spear phishing attack, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a spear phishing attack that uses a malicious Excel file to deliver a payload. This attack is part of a campaign targeting Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this observation.

2. **Understanding the ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques**:
   - **Reconnaissance** (Tactic) involves gathering information about the target.
   - **Initial Access** (Tactic) involves gaining an initial foothold within a network.
   - **Execution** (Tactic) involves executing malicious code on a compromised system.
   - **Persistence** (Tactic) involves maintaining access to a compromised system.
   - **Discovery** (Tactic) involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or environment after gaining access.
   - **Resource Development** (Tactic) involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations.

3. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - The mentioned techniques (T1589.002-Email Addresses under Reconnaissance, and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment under Initial Access) indicate activities related to gathering information about the target and gaining initial access to the target's system through spear phishing.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic is about setting up resources for future operations, which might not directly follow the initial access phase in a straightforward attack sequence.
   - **B: Persistence**: After gaining initial access, an attacker would likely try to maintain access, making persistence a plausible next step.
   - **C: Discovery**: After initial access, an attacker would likely try to discover more about the system or network they've accessed, which aligns well with the sequence of gaining access and then exploring the environment.
   - **D: Execution**: Execution of malicious code is likely how the initial access was achieved (through the malicious Excel file), so this might have already occurred as part of the initial access phase.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file indicates the attacker has already gained **Initial Access**.
   - After gaining access, the next logical steps for an attacker would be to either **execute** additional malicious code (which might have been part of the initial payload), **persist** in the system to maintain access, or start **discovery** to understand the network and system better for further exploitation.
   - Given that **Execution** might have been part of the initial access phase (delivering the payload), and considering the next steps in a typical attack sequence, **Persistence** and **Discovery** are strong candidates.
   - Between **Persistence** and **Discovery**, **Discovery** (C) is a more immediate next step after initial access, as understanding the environment is crucial for deciding how to persist or execute further malicious activities effectively.

**Final Answer: C**
