To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign employed data collection methods but before data was exfiltrated over the C2 channel, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of data collection methods using a custom storage file format by the CostaRicto Campaign. This indicates that the attackers have already collected data and are preparing for the next steps. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after data collection but before the data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, with the technique **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**. This indicates the method used for exfiltrating data.
   - **Tactic: Collection**, with the technique **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**. This shows how data was collected and stored, aligning with the custom storage file format mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration** is the tactic that involves moving data from the victim's system to the attacker's system, which is mentioned to happen after the step we are trying to identify.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance** is about gathering information about the target environment, which typically happens before or at the beginning of an attack, not after data collection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** refers to the attacker's ability to control the compromised system and issue commands. This is a crucial step that would occur after initial access and potentially after data collection, as it would be necessary for managing the flow of data and for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation** involves gaining higher privileges on a system, which could happen at various points in an attack but isn't directly implied as a necessary step between data collection and exfiltration in this context.

Given the context that data has been collected and stored in a custom format, and considering the need for the attackers to manage and potentially prepare the system for exfiltration, **Command and Control (C)** seems the most plausible tactic. This is because establishing command and control would be essential for the attackers to issue commands, potentially prepare the collected data for exfiltration, and then exfiltrate the data over the C2 channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Data collection using a custom storage file format has occurred.
2. The attackers need to manage the collected data and the compromised system.
3. Command and Control is necessary for managing the system and preparing for data exfiltration.
4. Exfiltration over the C2 channel happens after the system is under control and data is ready to be moved.

**Final Answer: C**
