To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after performing network reconnaissance and gathering information, an attacker (Emissary Panda) uses stolen credentials and exploits CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) to traverse the network. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**, with techniques involving the exploitation of remote services (T1210) and the use of SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002). These techniques are used for moving laterally within a network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance**, with a technique involving credentials (T1589.001), which is about gathering information and credentials for potential use in further attacks.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Lateral Movement (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to move within a network, which aligns with the action of exploiting EternalBlue to traverse the network. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this action.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is about establishing communication channels for controlling compromised systems, which doesn't directly relate to the preparatory phase before lateral movement.
   - **Impact (C)**: This tactic involves actions taken to disrupt or manipulate systems and data, which is not directly related to the preparatory phase of gathering information and credentials before moving laterally.
   - **Discovery (D)**: This tactic is about gaining knowledge of the target system, network, or organization, which aligns with the initial phase of performing network reconnaissance and gathering information, including credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker performed network reconnaissance and gathered information.
   - The use of stolen credentials and exploitation of EternalBlue for network traversal indicates a phase of lateral movement.
   - Before lateral movement can occur, especially with the use of specific exploits and credentials, the attacker must have a good understanding of the network and necessary credentials, which points to a discovery or reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: D**
