To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already set up persistence through a scheduled task named PolicyConverter. This indicates that the attacker has established a means to maintain access to the compromised system over time. Before communicating with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests, we need to identify which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1205 - Traffic Signaling
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task

   These TTPs indicate that the attacker has focused on establishing persistence, with T1053.005 specifically mentioning the use of a scheduled task, which aligns with the "PolicyConverter" scheduled task mentioned in the question. T1205, Traffic Signaling, is about using a specific protocol or channel to signal to the attacker that a system is compromised or to trigger certain actions, but it's more about the communication aspect after persistence is established.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker setting up infrastructure that can be used for future campaigns. While it could be relevant in a broader campaign context, it doesn't directly fit between establishing persistence and communicating with compromised websites.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gather information about the system or network they've compromised. Given that persistence has already been established, the next logical step before communicating with compromised websites might not necessarily involve more discovery, as the question implies a progression towards action rather than reconnaissance.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the attacker removing data from the compromised system. While exfiltration could occur at various points in an attack, the question hints at communication with compromised websites, which might not directly imply data exfiltration.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic is about establishing a channel for controlling the compromised system. Given that the attacker has set up persistence and is about to communicate with compromised websites, this suggests the need for command and control to direct these communications or actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has established persistence, indicating they want to maintain access.
   - The next step involves communicating with compromised legitimate websites, which suggests the attacker needs to control or direct the compromised system or systems.
   - Command and Control (C2) is essential for directing these communications or actions, making it the most likely tactic to occur after establishing persistence and before communicating with compromised websites.

Final Answer: D
