To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers established command and control (C2) servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that attackers have already established command and control servers in various locations. This implies that the attackers have successfully set up infrastructure to communicate with compromised systems. The tactic of establishing C2 servers falls under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data in a remote location, often as part of exfiltrating data from a target network. It suggests that after establishing C2, the attackers might be interested in collecting and possibly exfiltrating data.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.004-Server**: This technique involves using servers for resource development, which could be related to the establishment of C2 servers but also indicates the use of servers for other malicious purposes, such as hosting malware or staging areas for data.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique specifically mentions using DNS for command and control, which is a method used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. This is directly related to the establishment of C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the C2 servers are already established, the next logical steps for the attackers would involve using these servers for malicious activities. 
   - **Option A: Impact** refers to tactics that are intended to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the integrity of systems, data, or services. While possible, this doesn't directly follow the establishment of C2 unless the attackers' goal is to cause immediate harm, which isn't directly implied by the establishment of C2 servers alone.
   - **Option B: Persistence** involves techniques that attackers use to keep access to systems or networks. Establishing C2 servers is a form of persistence but the question asks for the tactic that occurs after C2 establishment.
   - **Option C: Credential Access** involves obtaining credentials to access systems or networks. While this could be a next step, the establishment of C2 doesn't directly imply that credential access is the immediate next goal, especially since C2 can be used for various purposes including but not limited to credential access.
   - **Option D: Command and Control** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after C2 servers are established, implying that the C2 tactic itself is already in progress.

Considering the above analysis, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 servers, given the context of the related TTPs, would be to use the established C2 for further malicious activities such as data collection or exfiltration, which aligns more closely with the **Collection** tactic (implied by T1074.002) but isn't directly listed as an option. However, among the provided options, **Persistence (B)** is a tactic that would likely occur after establishing C2, as it involves maintaining access to the compromised systems, which the C2 servers facilitate. Persistence is about keeping the access, which can be achieved and maintained through the established C2 channels.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Establishing C2 servers is a critical step for attackers to communicate with compromised systems.
2. The related TTPs suggest activities post-C2 establishment, such as data staging and using servers for resource development.
3. Among the given options, the most logical next step after establishing C2, considering typical attack flows, involves maintaining access and potentially using the C2 for further malicious activities.

**Final Answer: B**
