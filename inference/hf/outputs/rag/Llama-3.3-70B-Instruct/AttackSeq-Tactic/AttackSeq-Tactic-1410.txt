To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Initial Access and before ensuring continued functionality by abusing a legitimate software component, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial Access** was achieved through the injection of malicious code in a dynamic library of 3CX software. This is an example of **T1055.001 - Dynamic-link Library Injection**, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion and can also be related to Privilege Escalation, as indicated by the related TTPs.

2. The **Related TTPs** mention **Tactic: Privilege Escalation** and **Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**, as well as **Tactic: Defense Evasion** with the same technique. This suggests that the initial access likely involved evading defenses and possibly escalating privileges.

3. After gaining initial access, the next logical steps for an attacker would involve establishing a foothold, which could involve **Execution** of malicious code to achieve further goals, **Discovery** to understand the environment better, **Persistence** to maintain access, or **Resource Development** to prepare for further exploitation.

4. Given that the attackers ensured their continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component after initial access, this implies they needed to execute their malicious code in a way that would allow them to maintain their presence without being detected easily.

5. **Execution (A)** is the most direct next step after initial access, as it involves executing the malicious code injected into the dynamic library to achieve the attacker's objectives, which could include setting up persistence, escalating privileges, or starting the process of discovering the network.

6. **Discovery (B)** and **Persistence (C)** are also plausible steps but are more specific to the goals of understanding the environment and maintaining access, respectively. **Resource Development (D)** is less directly related to the immediate post-initial access activities described.

7. Considering the need to execute malicious code to achieve further goals, such as abusing a legitimate software component for continued functionality, **Execution** stands out as the most likely tactic to occur immediately after initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- Initial access through dynamic library injection.
- Related TTPs indicate defense evasion and potential privilege escalation.
- Execution is necessary for running malicious code post-access.
- Ensuring continued functionality implies a need for initial code execution.

**Final Answer: A**
