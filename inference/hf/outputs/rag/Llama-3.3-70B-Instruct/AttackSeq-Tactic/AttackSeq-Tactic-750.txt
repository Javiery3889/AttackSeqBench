To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, identified as Gamaredon, has already gained access to a system. They have used backdoors to list interesting files and have propagated through the system using malicious macros in Word and Excel documents via Outlook VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros. The attacker is now searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This indicates the initial method of gaining access to the system was through spearphishing with an attachment, which aligns with the use of malicious macros in documents.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This shows that the attacker used Visual Basic (VBA macros in this context) for executing their malicious code, which is consistent with the propagation method described.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This tactic and technique are about discovering files and directories on the system, which directly relates to the action of searching for sensitive documents.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the attacker has already gained access and is now searching for sensitive documents, we need to identify which ATT&CK tactic this action aligns with. 
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** involves gaining higher privileges on a system, which is not directly related to searching for documents.
   - **B: Collection** involves gathering information relevant to the attacker's goals, which aligns with searching for sensitive documents.
   - **C: Command and Control** refers to the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, not directly related to the action of searching for documents.
   - **D: Credential Access** involves obtaining credentials, which is not the primary focus of searching for sensitive documents.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already gained access to the system and is using various techniques to move laterally and gather information.
   - The action of searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives is directly related to gathering information that could be useful for the attacker's goals.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this action is **Collection**, as it involves gathering relevant information.

Final Answer: B
