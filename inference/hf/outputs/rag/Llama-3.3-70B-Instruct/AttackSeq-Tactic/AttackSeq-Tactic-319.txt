To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Geumseong121 used a website disguised as a fundraising service to deliver a malicious app to the victims, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious actor, Geumseong121, uses a disguised website to deliver a malicious app. This action is aimed at gaining access to the victim's system or device. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this initial action.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This indicates the use of malicious links to execute malicious code. While this is relevant to the initial phase of delivering malware, it's more about the method of execution rather than the phase that follows initial access.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, which aligns with the scenario of using a disguised website to deliver a malicious app. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option C: Initial Access** is what has already occurred, as described in the scenario. The malicious app has been delivered, indicating that initial access has been achieved.
   - **Option D: Resource Development** is not directly related to the immediate actions following the delivery of a malicious app. It involves the development of resources (like infrastructure or capabilities) that can be used for future operations.
   - **Option A: Defense Evasion** could be a subsequent tactic, as once inside, an attacker might attempt to evade defenses. However, it's not the most direct next step after gaining initial access through a malicious app.
   - **Option B: Command and Control** is a critical phase that follows initial access. After gaining access to a system, establishing command and control (C2) is essential for the attacker to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or move laterally within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes the initial access phase through a malicious app delivered via a disguised website.
   - The immediate next step for an attacker after gaining initial access would be to establish a means to control the compromised system or app, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access would involve establishing Command and Control.

Final Answer: B
