To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already performed credential dumping (likely using Mimikatz, as mentioned) and have executed reconnaissance commands. They then use the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems using webshells. The key elements here are the use of credentials to access other systems and the execution of commands remotely.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are focused on Credential Access, specifically techniques related to obtaining credentials (T1003.001-LSASS Memory and T1003.006-DCSync). These techniques are about accessing credentials, not about the actions taken after credentials are obtained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network, often to expand access and privilege. Using collected credentials to execute commands on other systems via webshells fits this description, as it involves using the credentials to access and control other systems.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: While reconnaissance was mentioned in the initial steps (discovering remote systems, user accounts, and network topology), the question asks about the tactic that occurred when the actors leveraged the collected credentials to execute commands, which goes beyond mere reconnaissance.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials, which has already been accomplished according to the question. The question is asking about what happened after the credentials were obtained.
   - **D: Discovery**: Similar to reconnaissance, discovery involves gathering information about the system or network. The action described (executing commands on other systems) is about utilizing the information and credentials gathered, not just discovering more information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where the attackers have already gained access to credentials and are now using those credentials to access and execute commands on other systems.
   - The related TTPs focus on how the credentials were obtained, not what was done with them afterward.
   - Lateral Movement (A) is the tactic that best describes using credentials to move laterally within a network and execute commands on other systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: A
