To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after BlackEnergy 3 malware gathered local network information and before it sent data to servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where BlackEnergy 3 malware uses the GetAdaptersInfo() function API to gather local network information. This action is followed by an unspecified tactic and then the malware sends data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe. We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This indicates the malware is gathering information about the system's network configuration, which aligns with using GetAdaptersInfo() to gather local network information.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This suggests the malware is collecting data from the local system, which could be a step after discovering the network configuration and before sending the data out.
   - **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This is about causing an impact on the system, specifically through data destruction, which does not directly relate to the sequence of gathering information and sending data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems or data. While credential access could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly follow the action of gathering network information and then sending data.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the malware. Given that the malware is sending data to servers, this could be a plausible step as it implies communication with a command and control server.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within a network. While possible, the question doesn't directly imply movement between systems, just the gathering of network information and sending data.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to a system or network, which would occur before the gathering of network information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware gathers local network information, which is a discovery tactic.
   - The next logical step, based on the provided TTPs and the fact that the malware sends data to servers, would involve communicating with those servers, which aligns with command and control activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after gathering network information and before sending data to servers across Europe is the establishment of command and control.

Final Answer: B
