To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros within malicious Word documents are executed, and then scripts from watering hole attacks start communicating with external servers. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when this communication started.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1059.005-Visual Basic", which refers to the use of Visual Basic (in this case, VBA) for execution. This indicates that the initial step involves executing malicious code through VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which aligns with the execution of VBA macros. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred when the scripts began communicating with external servers, not the execution of the macros themselves.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the system or data, which doesn't directly relate to communicating with external servers.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server, which fits the scenario of scripts communicating with external servers.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which could be achieved through the execution of malicious macros but doesn't directly involve communication with external servers after access is gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The execution of VBA macros is an initial step that allows malicious code to run on a victim's system.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred when scripts (presumably deployed or enabled by the initial macro execution) began communicating with external servers.
   - Communicating with external servers for command and control is a distinct phase of an attack that follows initial access and execution of malicious code.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this phase of the attack is Command and Control, as it directly involves communication with external servers to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: C
