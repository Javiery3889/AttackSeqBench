To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where UNC1151, after gaining initial access through spear phishing campaigns, attempts to steal victim credentials via spoofed websites. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during these efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to the initial access phase, specifically mentioning "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment" as techniques used for gaining initial access. However, the question asks about the tactic involved in stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites, which implies a different phase of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker removing data from the victim's system. While exfiltration might occur later in the attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the act of stealing credentials.
   - **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain credentials, such as passwords, keys, or other authentication data. Stealing credentials via spoofed websites directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic is about the attacker learning more about the system, network, or environment. While discovery might be a part of the attack process, it doesn't directly relate to the act of stealing credentials.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic is about how the attacker first gains access to the system or network. The question already states that initial access was gained through spear phishing, so this doesn't apply to the subsequent action of stealing credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the initial access has already been achieved through spear phishing.
   - The focus is on the subsequent action of stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites.
   - Among the provided answer choices, **Credential Access** is the tactic that directly involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the action of stealing credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after initial access, given the context of stealing credentials, points towards the Credential Access tactic.

Final Answer: B
