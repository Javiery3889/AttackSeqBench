To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained initial access to servers V1 and V2 by installing backdoors. Before establishing a covert communication channel, the attacker uses V2's SMB service to transfer sensitive operations. We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred during this transfer.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Lateral Movement, specifically using SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) and Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570). There's also a mention of Command and Control via File Transfer Protocols (T1071.002), but the primary focus is on Lateral Movement techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection. While defense evasion might be a part of the attack, the question specifically asks about the transfer of sensitive operations via V2's SMB service, which doesn't directly imply evasion techniques.
   - **Discovery (B)**: Discovery tactics are about gathering information about the target environment. The scenario described involves transferring operations, not necessarily discovering new information about the network or systems.
   - **Impact (C)**: Impact tactics are about the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. The transfer of sensitive operations might be part of setting up for impact, but it doesn't directly align with the typical techniques under Impact.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. Using V2's SMB service to transfer sensitive operations suggests the attacker is moving laterally within the network, potentially to expand their access or control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of transferring sensitive operations via V2's SMB service after initial access and before establishing a covert communication channel.
   - The related TTPs highlight Lateral Movement techniques, specifically using SMB services for lateral movement.
   - Given the context, the action described best fits with moving within the network to achieve further access or control, which is characteristic of Lateral Movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.

Final Answer: D
