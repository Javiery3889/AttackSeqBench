To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has collected information from an iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. The attacker then sends this data out via HTTP and receives commands from the attacker. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely involved in this process.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This involves collecting data from a local system, which aligns with the initial collection of data from the iOS device.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could include sending data via HTTP and receiving commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network before an attack. While it's related to information gathering, it doesn't directly involve sending collected data out or receiving commands.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for commanding and controlling compromised systems or assets. Given that the scenario involves sending data out via HTTP and receiving commands, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up infrastructure. It doesn't directly relate to the act of sending data out or receiving commands.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying systems, services, or other assets that could be used for further exploitation. While related to information gathering, it doesn't directly involve the exfiltration of data or receiving commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes collecting data and then sending it out via HTTP while also receiving commands from the attacker.
   - The related TTPs highlight exfiltration techniques, including exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with sending data and receiving commands.
   - Among the answer choices, **Command and Control (B)** is the tactic that most directly involves establishing a channel for sending data out from a compromised system and receiving commands from the attacker.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the described scenario involves the **Command and Control** tactic.

Final Answer: B
