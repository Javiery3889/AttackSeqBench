To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute their malicious activities during Operation Aurora, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred before the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. This implies we are looking for an action or set of actions that precede the exploitation phase, which is part of the "Execution" tactic in the ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the exploitation of a client-side application (in this case, Internet Explorer) to execute malicious code. This is the point at which the attackers were able to run their malicious activities.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This suggests a method by which an attacker gains initial access to a system, often through exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or their plugins, which aligns with the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow an adversary to maintain their presence on a system. While important for long-term access, it doesn't directly precede the exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial execution.
   - **Option B: Execution**: This is the tactic where the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities falls. It's the action of executing malicious code, not the step before.
   - **Option C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold on a system. Given that exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer is a method of gaining access (as indicated by T1189-Drive-by Compromise), this seems like a strong candidate.
   - **Option D: Credential Access**: This involves obtaining credentials to access systems or services. While important, it's not directly related to the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities for code execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer is a method of gaining initial access to a system, as it allows the attackers to execute their malicious code.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that the exploitation (Execution tactic) is closely tied to gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before or is directly related to the exploitation is gaining **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: C
