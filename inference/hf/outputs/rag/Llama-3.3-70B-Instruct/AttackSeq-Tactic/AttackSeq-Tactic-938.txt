To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an exploitation of vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. This exploitation leads to the execution of commands and the installation of an MSI package on the system. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this exploitation.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution". This indicates that the initial action involved exploiting a client-side vulnerability to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. While exploitation of vulnerabilities can be a method of initial access, the question implies that the exploitation has already occurred, leading to command execution and MSI package installation. Thus, the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. Given that the exploitation of vulnerabilities has led to the execution of commands and installation of an MSI package, this aligns closely with the execution tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred "after" the exploitation, suggesting we are looking for a subsequent action.
   - **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. While installing an MSI package could potentially lead to actions aimed at gaining credential access, there's no direct indication in the question that credential access was the immediate next step after exploitation.
   - **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic is not a standard ATT&CK tactic. ATT&CK tactics include techniques like Reconnaissance, Resource Development is more related to the concept of developing resources (like establishing a foothold, or creating a backdoor) for future operations but it's not directly listed as a tactic in the ATT&CK framework.

Given the context, the exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute commands and install an MSI package directly aligns with the **Execution** tactic. However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred "after" this exploitation, and considering the standard ATT&CK tactics, **Execution (B)** is the closest match because the exploitation itself is a form of execution, and subsequent actions (like installing an MSI package) could be part of further execution tactics or lead into other tactics like Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Credential Access. But based on the provided options and the direct context of exploitation leading to command execution, **Execution** seems to be the most relevant, even though it might seem like a precursor to the question's "after" clause.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial action: Exploitation of vulnerabilities for client execution.
2. Determine the immediate outcome: Execution of commands and installation of an MSI package.
3. Evaluate subsequent tactics based on the ATT&CK framework and provided options.

**Final Answer**: B
