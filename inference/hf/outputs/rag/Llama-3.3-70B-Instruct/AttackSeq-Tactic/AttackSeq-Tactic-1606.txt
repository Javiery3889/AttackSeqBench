To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access. The initial access was gained by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents. This implies that before gaining access, the attackers would have needed to gather information or prepare for the attack in some way.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This tactic and technique are about the attacker discovering files and directories on the compromised system, which would typically occur after initial access has been gained.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This involves gaining initial access to a system through spearphishing with an attachment, which aligns with the method described in the question (using malicious documents like .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, and .PPT files).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold on a system, which is what the attackers did using malicious documents. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within an already compromised network, which would occur after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: While discovery does involve gathering information, the specific technique mentioned (T1083) is more relevant to post-compromise activities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before attacking, which would logically precede initial access. Reconnaissance could involve identifying vulnerabilities, mapping out the network, or gathering information that would be used to craft targeted spearphishing attacks (like those using malicious documents).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before initial access was gained through exploiting vulnerabilities with malicious documents.
   - Initial access (A) is the event itself, not what happened before.
   - Lateral movement (B) happens after initial access.
   - Discovery (C) as mentioned, particularly with the technique provided, seems more relevant to post-access activities.
   - Reconnaissance (D) is about gathering information before an attack, which would logically precede the use of malicious documents to gain initial access.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence is that reconnaissance would occur before the initial access to gather necessary information for a targeted attack.

Final Answer: D
