To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit. SharpHound is a tool often used for network reconnaissance and mapping, which can be used to gather information about the target environment without leaving traces on disk. PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts that can be used for various purposes, including exploitation and post-exploitation activities, which can also be used in memory to avoid detection. The question implies that these tools were used for scanning and mapping targets, suggesting activities related to gathering information about the target environment.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Discovery" with the technique "T1018-Remote System Discovery". This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with the use of SharpHound for network reconnaissance. The other related TTP mentions "Defense Evasion" with the technique "T1562.006-Indicator Blocking", which involves evading detection by blocking indicators that might be used to detect malicious activity. This could relate to the use of in-memory tools like PowerSploit to avoid leaving traces on disk.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**: 
   - **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges within a system. While it's a common step in many attack sequences, it doesn't directly relate to the initial use of tools for scanning and mapping without leaving disk traces.
   - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic directly involves gathering information about the target environment, which aligns with the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping. The related TTP specifically mentions "Discovery" as a tactic, supporting this choice.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which could be a part of the attack sequence but doesn't directly relate to the scanning and mapping activities described.
   - **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which might be necessary for the use of some scanning tools but doesn't directly align with the described activities of scanning and mapping without leaving disk traces.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: 
   - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets suggests activities focused on gathering information about the target environment.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that "Discovery" is a key part of this process, especially with the mention of "T1018-Remote System Discovery".
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before these activities is related to setting up the environment for these tools to be effective, but given the choices, **Discovery** is the most directly related to the activities described.

Final Answer: B
