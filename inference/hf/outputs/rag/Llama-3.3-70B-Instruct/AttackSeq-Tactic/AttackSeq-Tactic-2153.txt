To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after discovering game production environments by pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, APT41 collected source code and digital certificates. This implies that the attackers had to move through the network to reach the desired systems, suggesting some form of movement or access escalation was necessary.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This technique involves using code signing to make malicious code appear legitimate, which could be used after gaining access to sensitive areas of the network, such as where source code and digital certificates are stored.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information about the system, which aligns with the initial phase of discovering game production environments.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Collection**: This is the tactic that involves gathering information, which is what APT41 did by collecting source code and digital certificates. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this collection.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through the network, which aligns with "pivoting between Windows and Linux systems" to discover game production environments. It's a plausible step before collecting sensitive data.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: While this could be necessary to access certain areas of the network, the question doesn't directly imply that privileges were escalated specifically to collect source code and digital certificates.
   - **D: Persistence**: This involves maintaining access over time, which might not directly relate to the act of discovering environments and then collecting data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question implies movement through the network ("pivoting between Windows and Linux systems") to reach the game production environments.
   - The related TTPs suggest that system information discovery (T1082) was used, which is part of the Discovery tactic, but the question asks for the tactic before collection.
   - Lateral Movement (B) is the most direct precursor to collecting source code and digital certificates, as it involves navigating through the network, which would be necessary to reach and access these sensitive resources.

Final Answer: B
