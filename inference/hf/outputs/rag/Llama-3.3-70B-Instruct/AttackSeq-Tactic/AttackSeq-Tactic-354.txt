To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign utilized encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute their custom VM-based payload and before the attackers used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions taken by the CostaRicto Campaign. Initially, they used encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute a custom VM-based payload. This action is related to executing malicious code on a compromised system. After this execution, the attackers then used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning, which is related to discovering services running on the network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves scanning for open ports and services on the network, which aligns with the use of tools like pscan and nmap.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves executing commands via PowerShell, which aligns with the initial action of using encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial action (using PowerShell for execution) is clearly related to the **Execution** tactic.
   - The subsequent action (using pscan and nmap for network service scanning) is related to the **Discovery** tactic, specifically **Network Service Discovery (T1046)**.
   - Given these two points, we need to find the tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions. The options provided are **Defense Evasion**, **Persistence**, **Discovery**, and **Lateral Movement**.
   - **Defense Evasion** could be a part of the initial execution phase or a separate action but doesn't directly fit between execution and discovery in a logical sequence based on the provided context.
   - **Persistence** involves maintaining access to the system, which could happen after initial execution but before further actions like discovery. However, it's not directly implied by the use of PowerShell for execution followed by network scanning.
   - **Discovery** is the tactic that involves gathering information about the system or network, which includes network service scanning. However, the question asks for the tactic before the discovery actions (like using pscan and nmap), so while discovery is relevant, it's not the answer we're looking for in this sequence.
   - **Lateral Movement** involves moving from one system to another within the network, which could logically occur after initial execution (especially if the payload was designed to spread or enable further movement) and before or as part of the discovery phase to identify potential targets for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first executed their payload using PowerShell, which is an execution tactic.
   - The next logical step, before they start scanning the network for services (a discovery tactic), could involve establishing a foothold or moving within the network to prepare for or as part of the discovery process.
   - Given the options and the context, **Lateral Movement** seems the most plausible tactic that would occur after the initial execution and before the network service discovery, as it aligns with the progression of an attack where after gaining initial access and executing code, an attacker would look to move within the network, potentially using the executed payload as a means to do so, and then scan for services to identify vulnerabilities or points of interest.

Final Answer: D
