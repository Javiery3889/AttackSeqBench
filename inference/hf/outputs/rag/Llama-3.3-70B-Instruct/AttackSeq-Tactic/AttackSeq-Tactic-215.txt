To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials and then uploading stolen files with specific extensions to a Command and Control (C2) server. It asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurs before the files are uploaded.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Collection**, **Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This indicates the adversary is collecting data from the local system, which could include files with specific extensions.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**, **Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This shows the adversary is exfiltrating (uploading) data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the action of uploading stolen files to a C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, **Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This is about stealing web session cookies, which is relevant to the backdoor stealing Google Chrome credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question mentions the backdoor stealing credentials (which aligns with **Credential Access**), and then there's an action of uploading files (which aligns with **Exfiltration**).
   - Before the files can be uploaded (exfiltrated), the adversary needs to identify and collect the files of interest on the local system. This action of identifying and gathering files for exfiltration fits the **Collection** tactic.
   - **Reconnaissance** is about gathering information about the target environment before an attack, which doesn't directly fit the sequence after credential theft and before file upload.
   - **Discovery** involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system and its environment, which could happen at various stages but isn't directly implied as the immediate step before exfiltration in this context.
   - **Credential Access** has already occurred (stealing Chrome credentials), so it's not the next step before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials, which is an action of **Credential Access**.
   - Before uploading specific files to the C2 server (**Exfiltration**), the adversary would need to collect or identify these files on the local system.
   - The **Collection** tactic, specifically collecting **Data from Local System (T1005)**, is the most logical step that occurs before the exfiltration of these files.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurs before the stolen files are uploaded to the C2 server is **Collection**.

Final Answer: D
