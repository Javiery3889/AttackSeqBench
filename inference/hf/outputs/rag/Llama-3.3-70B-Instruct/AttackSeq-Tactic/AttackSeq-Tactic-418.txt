To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information to identify exposed and misconfigured instances before attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for Initial Access. This implies a phase of gathering information or reconnaissance prior to the actual exploitation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access. While it's related to the exploitation phase, it doesn't directly involve scanning or reconnaissance.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This directly involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which aligns with the activity of scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information about exposed and misconfigured instances.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves discovering services running on a network, which could be part of the reconnaissance process but is more focused on post-compromise rather than pre-exploitation reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure. It doesn't directly relate to scanning for vulnerabilities.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which is not about scanning or reconnaissance.
   - **C: Initial Access**: While the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports is indeed an initial access tactic, the question asks for the tactic before this exploitation, which involves scanning and reconnaissance.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic directly involves gathering information about the target, including scanning for vulnerabilities and identifying exposed services, which perfectly matches the activity described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information before exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of reconnaissance in identifying vulnerabilities and exposed services.
   - Among the answer choices, only **Reconnaissance** directly aligns with the activity of scanning and gathering information prior to exploitation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with **Reconnaissance** to identify vulnerable hosts and misconfigured instances before exploiting them for initial access.

Final Answer: D
