To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading. DLL sideloading is a technique used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, which is a method of executing malware. This implies that the attackers have already gained some level of access to the system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This tactic and technique suggest that the attackers are moving laterally within the network and potentially using shared content to spread their malware. However, this does not directly indicate the initial steps taken to gain access.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This is directly related to the action described in the question, where DLL sideloading is used to evade defenses and execute malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**: Exfiltration involves stealing data from a network, which would typically occur after the attackers have already gained access and executed their malware, not before.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**: Collection involves gathering information about the target, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly relate to the action of deploying a dropper executable.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: Initial Access involves the tactics used by attackers to initially gain access to a network. Given that the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading is a method of executing malware, it implies that the attackers have already gained initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**: Execution involves tactics used to execute malicious code, which is what the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading achieves. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading is a method of executing malware, which implies that the attackers have already gained access to the system.
   - The most logical step before executing malware (in this case, via DLL sideloading) would be gaining initial access to the system.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of the dropper executable is Initial Access.

Final Answer: C
