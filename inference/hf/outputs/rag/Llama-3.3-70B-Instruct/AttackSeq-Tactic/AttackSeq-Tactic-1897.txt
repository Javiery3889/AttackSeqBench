To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of InstallUtil.exe for defense evasion and the injection of a malicious payload into memory. This indicates that the attacker has already performed some initial steps to evade defenses and establish a presence on the system. The mention of the payload's communication pattern with an attacker-controlled server suggests that the attacker is now interacting with the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.007 (Msiexec): This technique involves using Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) to execute malicious code, which can be used for defense evasion.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055 (Process Injection): This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection, which aligns with the injection of the malicious payload into memory mentioned in the question.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Defense Evasion (D)** has already been achieved through the use of InstallUtil.exe and process injection, so while ongoing evasion tactics might be used, the question implies a progression to another phase of the attack.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)** could be a next step to gain more control over the system, but the question specifically mentions communication with an attacker-controlled server, which suggests interaction rather than escalation.
   - **Exfiltration (C)** involves stealing data from the system, which might not directly relate to the communication pattern described unless the communication is for data exfiltration purposes. However, exfiltration typically follows establishing control and often involves command and control for direction.
   - **Command and Control (A)** is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's server to issue commands and receive data. Given that the payload is communicating with an attacker-controlled server, this suggests that the attacker is now in the phase of controlling the compromised system, which aligns with Command and Control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already evaded defenses using InstallUtil.exe and injected a malicious payload into memory.
   - The communication with an attacker-controlled server indicates an interaction phase where commands can be issued and data can be received.
   - Given the context, the most likely next tactic after establishing a foothold and evading defenses is to establish Command and Control to direct the compromised system's actions.

Final Answer: A
