To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor probed files in specified directories during the Discovery phase but before communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS as part of their Command and Control activities, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions starting with the Discovery phase, where SparrowDoor probes files in specified directories. This action is associated with the Discovery tactic, specifically the technique T1083 - File and Directory Discovery. The question then mentions communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server over HTTPS, which is part of the Command and Control tactic, utilizing the technique T1071.001 - Web Protocols. We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred between these two phases.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols. This is related to the communication with the C&C server.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083 - File and Directory Discovery. This is related to the probing of files in specified directories by SparrowDoor.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given that the initial action is Discovery (probing files) and the final action is Command and Control (communicating with the C&C server), we need to find a tactic that logically fits between these two in an attack sequence. The options provided are:
   - A: Execution. This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which could potentially happen after the discovery phase (when the attacker has identified potential targets or vulnerabilities) and before establishing command and control (as a means to execute code that facilitates C&C communication).
   - B: Command and Control. This is the final action mentioned in the question, so it's not what we're looking for.
   - C: Collection. While collection of data could happen at various stages, it doesn't directly fit as a necessary step between discovery and command and control in this context.
   - D: Resource Development. This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, which doesn't directly fit the sequence described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: 
   - The Discovery phase (T1083 - File and Directory Discovery) is about gathering information.
   - Before an attacker can effectively communicate with a C&C server (T1071.001 - Web Protocols), they likely need to execute some form of malicious code or payload on the compromised system to facilitate this communication.
   - Execution (A) is a plausible step that would enable the attacker to run the necessary code for establishing a connection with the C&C server.

Final Answer: A
