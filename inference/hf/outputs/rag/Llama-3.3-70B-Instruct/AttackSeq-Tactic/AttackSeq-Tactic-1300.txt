To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials for lateral movement and infected new machines within the network during Operation Cobalt Kitty, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement and infecting new machines. This implies that the attackers already have access to the network and are leveraging credentials to move laterally.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This indicates the use of valid accounts to evade defenses, which aligns with the lateral movement described.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests that valid accounts were used to gain initial access to the network.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This implies the use of domain accounts for persistence, which is relevant to maintaining access within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: Impact**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the target, which doesn't directly relate to the precursor actions of gaining access or moving laterally within a network.
   - **Option B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic of gaining an initial foothold within the network. Given that the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials for lateral movement, it's plausible that initial access was achieved before these actions.
   - **Option C: Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the target environment. While discovery is crucial for planning attacks, the question focuses on the action of using stolen credentials, which suggests that some level of access has already been achieved.
   - **Option D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is directly related to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the use of stolen credentials, implying that the credentials were already obtained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of stolen credentials for lateral movement implies that the attackers had already gained access to the network.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of valid accounts for defense evasion, initial access, and persistence, indicating a focus on leveraging credentials for network access and movement.
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic before the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement, we need to identify the tactic that would logically precede this action in an attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
