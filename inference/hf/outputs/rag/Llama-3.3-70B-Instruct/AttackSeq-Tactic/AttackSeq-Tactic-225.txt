To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have established persistence through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) by registering a script as a backdoor. After this, they communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using HTTP over port 80. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 (Web Protocols), which involves using web protocols for C2 communications.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008 (Fallback Channels), which involves using alternative channels for C2 in case the primary channel is compromised.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**. This is the tactic that involves establishing communication with C2 servers, which is what the question describes happening after establishing persistence. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**. This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls. Establishing a backdoor through WMI and using HTTP for C2 communication could be part of defense evasion, as it might be used to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**. This tactic involves the initial entry point into a network. Given that persistence has already been established, initial access would have occurred before this point.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**. The question states that persistence has already been established, so this is not the tactic that occurred before the communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before communicating with C2 servers, given that persistence has been established.
   - Since persistence (establishing a backdoor) is a method to maintain access, the initial entry into the system (Initial Access) would logically precede the establishment of persistence.
   - Defense Evasion could be considered part of the persistence or command and control phase, as it involves evading detection, which is not necessarily a linear step before C2 communication but rather an ongoing effort.
   - Therefore, considering the sequence of events (initial access, establishing persistence, and then communicating with C2 servers), the most logical choice that occurred before the described communication is the tactic related to gaining initial entry into the system.

Final Answer: C
