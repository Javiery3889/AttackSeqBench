To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used Metasploit for various activities, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have used Metasploit for several purposes, including port scanning, system reconnaissance, escalating privileges, and password brute forcing. These activities are aimed at moving laterally across networks. The key actions mentioned are:
   - Port scanning: Identifying open ports and services on target systems.
   - System reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target systems.
   - Escalating privileges: Gaining higher levels of access to systems or networks.
   - Password brute forcing: Using automated methods to guess passwords.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are:
   - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110.001-Password Guessing. This is directly related to the password brute forcing mentioned in the question.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery. This aligns with the port scanning and system reconnaissance activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. Given that the attackers have already engaged in activities like escalating privileges and password brute forcing, they likely have the means to move laterally. The use of Metasploit for these purposes suggests they are in the process of or have already gained access to multiple systems, making lateral movement a plausible next step.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: While reconnaissance is mentioned in the question, it's more of an initial step to gather information. The question implies that this has already been done to some extent (e.g., system reconnaissance).
   - **C: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control (C2) is crucial for attackers to issue commands to compromised systems. However, the question focuses on the actions taken to move laterally, not specifically on establishing C2 channels, although C2 is often a part of lateral movement.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the target system or network, such as data destruction or denial of service. While possible, the question's focus is on the movement and access phase rather than the impact phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have used Metasploit for reconnaissance, escalating privileges, and password brute forcing, indicating they are in the process of gaining access to and moving through a network.
   - The related TTPs support the idea that they are focused on gaining access (Credential Access) and discovering network services (Discovery), which are precursors to moving laterally.
   - Given the actions described, the most logical next step in the attack sequence is to move laterally within the network, which aligns with option A: Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: A
