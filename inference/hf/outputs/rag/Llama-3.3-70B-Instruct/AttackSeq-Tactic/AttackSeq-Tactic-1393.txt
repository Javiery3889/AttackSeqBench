To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already performed lateral movement and is now looking to stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives. This implies the attacker is in the process of gathering and preparing data to be extracted from the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the "Collection" tactic. Specifically, they mention:
   - **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data in a location that is accessible for exfiltration, which aligns with the concept of preparing data for extraction.
   - **T1560 - Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data, which could include creating multi-part archives to facilitate easier exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement** is the process of moving through a network while avoiding detection, which has already been accomplished according to the question.
   - **B: Command and Control** refers to how attackers communicate with compromised systems, which is not directly related to staging data for exfiltration.
   - **C: Impact** involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate systems and data, which does not directly relate to the preparation of data for exfiltration.
   - **D: Collection** is the tactic of gathering information, which directly relates to the staging and preparation of data for exfiltration, especially when considering the related TTPs provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives after lateral movement.
   - The related TTPs point towards techniques under the "Collection" tactic, specifically remote data staging and archiving collected data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the "Collection" tactic, as it involves gathering and preparing data for exfiltration, which matches the scenario described.

Final Answer: D
