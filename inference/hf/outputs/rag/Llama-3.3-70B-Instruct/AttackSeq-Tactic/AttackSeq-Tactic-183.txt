To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to create a .vbs script. This script is then used to download additional payloads. The focus here is on the actions taken to ensure the recurring execution of malicious payloads after the initial compromise.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This indicates the transfer of tools or payloads into the compromised system, which aligns with the downloading of additional payloads mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This refers to the use of Visual Basic (in this case, a .vbs script) for executing malicious code, which is directly related to the creation and execution of the .vbs script as described.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question asks about ensuring the recurring execution of malicious payloads. Let's evaluate the answer choices in the context of the provided TTPs and the scenario:
     - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow an adversary to maintain their presence on a compromised system. Given that the attacker has already executed code and is looking to ensure the recurring execution of malicious payloads, persistence is a logical next step. This would involve mechanisms to keep the malware running over time, despite system reboots or other interruptions.
     - **B: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is crucial for attackers to remain undetected, the question specifically asks about ensuring the recurring execution of payloads, not about evading detection.
     - **C: Exfiltration**: This involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. The scenario described focuses on executing and maintaining payloads, not on stealing data.
     - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within a network. The question does not indicate movement between systems but rather actions taken on a single compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access and executed malicious code.
   - The use of a .vbs script for downloading additional payloads suggests a need for maintaining access and ensuring these payloads can continue to run.
   - The most relevant tactic for ensuring the recurring execution of these payloads, given the context, is Persistence.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred to ensure the recurring execution of malicious payloads is Persistence.

Final Answer: A
