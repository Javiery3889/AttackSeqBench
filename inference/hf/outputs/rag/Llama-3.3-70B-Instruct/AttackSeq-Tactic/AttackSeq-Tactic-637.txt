To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers before they achieved initial access. This implies we are looking for a tactic that involves gathering information or planning prior to the actual attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   These TTPs indicate methods used for gaining initial access to a system, specifically through exploiting public-facing applications and spearphishing. However, the question is about what happened before these techniques were used, focusing on the planning or information-gathering phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems. It doesn't fit the context of planning or targeting before initial access.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which could include acquiring resources for future attacks but doesn't directly relate to targeting specific systems.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. While it's about information gathering, it's more focused on collecting data rather than the initial planning phase of targeting.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which directly supports strategic targeting. Reconnaissance would inform the attackers about potential vulnerabilities, such as public-facing web servers and the presence of SCADA software, making it a crucial step before attempting initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that informed GreyEnergy's targeting before they gained initial access.
   - The related TTPs show methods of initial access but don't directly answer the question about pre-access planning.
   - Reconnaissance (D) is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which would be necessary for strategically targeting ICS control workstations and servers before attempting to exploit them.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gathering information about the target through reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D
