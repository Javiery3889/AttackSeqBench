To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved based on the information provided and the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Iron group's malware checks for the presence of specific security software (360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security) and adjusts its installation method accordingly. After this step, but before employing dynamic function calls and anti-VM (Virtual Machine) techniques to evade detection, we are asked to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001 - Security Software Discovery**: This indicates the malware is checking for security software, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is related to evading detection in virtual environments, which is mentioned as a later step in the question (using anti-VM techniques).

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The initial step involves discovering security software, which is a **Discovery** tactic.
   - The question then asks for the tactic that occurred after this discovery but before the evasion techniques were employed. The evasion techniques mentioned (dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques) are directly related to **Defense Evasion**.
   - **Collection** (A) involves gathering information, which doesn't directly fit the context of adjusting installation methods based on security software presence and then evading detection.
   - **Persistence** (B) involves maintaining access, which also doesn't directly align with the actions described.
   - **Discovery** (C) has already occurred (security software discovery), so it's the initial step, not the one we're looking for.
   - **Defense Evasion** (D) is the tactic that involves evading detection, which includes using dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware first checks for security software (Discovery).
   - Based on this discovery, it chooses an installation method.
   - Before it employs evasion techniques (which are part of Defense Evasion), there's an implication of needing to establish or maintain a presence that requires evading detection.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the tactic after the discovery of security software and before the evasion techniques are used. Given the context, the most direct sequence after discovering security software and before evading detection would involve tactics that lead to or support the evasion, such as ensuring the malware can operate without immediate detection, which aligns with **Defense Evasion** as the tactic that encompasses the techniques used to avoid detection after the initial discovery and decision on installation method.

Final Answer: D
