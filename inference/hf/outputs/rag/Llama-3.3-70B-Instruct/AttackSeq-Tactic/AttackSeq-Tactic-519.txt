To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after establishing communication, the next step involves sending encrypted and obfuscated data to control servers. This implies that the initial communication has been set up, and now the focus is on the transmission of data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: 
   - The provided TTPs include the tactic "Command and Control" with the technique "T1071.001-Web Protocols." This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for communication between the implant and the control servers.
   - The other TTP is the tactic "Exfiltration" with the technique "T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel," which involves sending data from the compromised system to the control servers using the established command and control channel.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the control servers. Given that the question states the communication has already been established through HTTP POST requests, this tactic is already in progress.
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the control servers. The question specifically mentions sending "encrypted and obfuscated data" to the control servers, which aligns with the technique of exfiltrating data over a command and control channel (T1041).
   - **Resource Development (B)** and **Execution (D)**: These tactics do not directly relate to the act of sending data to control servers after communication has been established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that communication has been established and now focuses on sending data.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of web protocols for command and control and exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - Given the context, the most logical next step after establishing communication is to use this channel for exfiltrating data, especially since the question mentions sending encrypted and obfuscated data.

Final Answer: A
