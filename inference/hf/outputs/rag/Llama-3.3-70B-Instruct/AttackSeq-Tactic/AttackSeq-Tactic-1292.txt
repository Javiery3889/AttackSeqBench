To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before OceanLotus gained initial access through spear-phishing emails. This implies we are looking for a tactic that precedes the initial access phase, which involves gathering information or setting the stage for the attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provided are focused on Initial Access, specifically through spear-phishing links (T1566.002) and spear-phishing attachments (T1566.001). These are techniques used to gain initial access to a system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before initiating an attack. It makes sense as a precursor to spear-phishing, as understanding the target's email habits, personnel, and security measures can help craft more effective phishing emails.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which might not directly precede the initial access phase in a straightforward manner.
   - **Collection (C)**: While collection involves gathering data, it's more about collecting information from the target environment after access has been gained, rather than before.
   - **Discovery (D)**: Discovery is about identifying systems, assets, or information within the target environment, which typically occurs after initial access has been achieved.

Given the context of preparing for a spear-phishing campaign, the most logical precursor tactic is gathering information about the target to make the phishing attempt more successful.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before gaining initial access.
   - The initial access methods mentioned (spear-phishing) require prior knowledge of the target for maximum effectiveness.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering this necessary information before an attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gathering information about the target.

Final Answer: A
