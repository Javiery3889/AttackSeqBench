To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Bankshot implant was executed but before it began evading detection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The Bankshot implant is executed by downloading and running a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) implant from a malicious domain. This action implies that the initial stage of the attack involves executing malicious code on the target system. After execution, but before evading detection by wiping files and content, we are looking for a tactic that fits this sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection, which is mentioned as an action taken after the point we are trying to identify.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**: This technique is related to the execution of the Bankshot implant itself, as it involves injecting malicious code into a process using a DLL.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique is a method used to maintain persistence on a system by hijacking the search order for DLLs, which could be related to the implant's actions after initial execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on a system. While it's a common step in many attacks, the provided context doesn't directly imply that privilege escalation occurred immediately after the implant's execution and before evasion techniques.
   - **Option B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or data. The context doesn't directly suggest that credential access is the immediate next step after executing the implant and before evading detection.
   - **Option C: Execution**: This tactic has already occurred, as the implant was executed. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this execution.
   - **Option D: Persistence**: Given that the implant was executed and the next steps involve evading detection, persistence is a logical step. The implant needs to establish a lasting presence on the system, which could involve techniques like DLL search order hijacking (T1574.001) to ensure it remains active or can be re-executed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Bankshot implant's execution is the initial step, involving the download and running of a malicious DLL.
   - The next logical step, before evading detection, would be to ensure the implant can persist on the system.
   - Persistence (Option D) is the most plausible tactic that aligns with the sequence of events described, as it would involve actions taken to maintain access to the system after the initial execution and before attempting to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
