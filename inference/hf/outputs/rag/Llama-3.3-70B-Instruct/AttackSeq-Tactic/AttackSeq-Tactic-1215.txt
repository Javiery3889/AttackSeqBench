To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have used commands like `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration in the victim's environment. These commands are typically used to gather information about the system and network, such as the current user and connected computers. After this enumeration phase, the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is a tool often used for post-exploitation activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the Discovery tactic, specifically:
   - **T1082: System Information Discovery** - This technique involves collecting information about the system, which could include details such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations.
   - **T1033: System Owner/User Discovery** - This technique is about identifying the owners or users of a system, which aligns with the use of `whoami` to determine the current user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Credential Access (A)**: While credential access is crucial for moving laterally and executing commands on remote systems, the question specifically mentions enumeration activities that are more closely related to discovering system and user information rather than obtaining credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for injecting processes on remote computers implies lateral movement, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this action.
   - **Discovery (C)**: Given the context of using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration, this tactic aligns perfectly. Discovery involves gathering information about the target system and network, which is exactly what these commands are used for.
   - **Impact (D)**: This tactic is about causing an effect on the target system or network, such as data manipulation or disruption. The activities described are more about gathering information and setting the stage for further actions rather than causing direct impact.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first needed to understand the environment they were operating in, which involved discovering system and user information.
   - The use of `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` directly relates to the Discovery tactic, specifically techniques like System Information Discovery and System Owner/User Discovery.
   - Therefore, the most logical sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the execution of commands and injection of processes on remote computers, as it provides the necessary information for further actions like lateral movement or credential access.

Final Answer: C
