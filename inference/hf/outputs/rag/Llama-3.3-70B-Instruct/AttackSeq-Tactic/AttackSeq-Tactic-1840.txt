To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after gaining domain administrator privileges (likely through collecting passwords with tools like Mimikatz), uses tools like PsExec and WinExe to spread across a compromised network. The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) include:
   - **Initial Access** with the technique of using **Domain Accounts** (T1078.002). This involves using domain accounts as a means to gain an initial foothold within a network.
   - **Privilege Escalation** also with the technique of using **Domain Accounts** (T1078.002), which involves exploiting domain account credentials to elevate privileges.
   - **Resource Development** with the technique of **Tool** (T1588.002), which involves obtaining or creating tools that can be used for various purposes during an operation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic refers to the initial entry point of an attacker into a network. Given that the scenario describes actions taken after obtaining domain administrator privileges, this is not the most likely tactic.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: While the scenario mentions obtaining domain administrator privileges, the question specifically asks about the tactic involved in spreading across the network using PsExec and WinExe, not the escalation itself.
   - **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves maintaining access within a network. While important, the scenario specifically mentions spreading across the network, which suggests movement rather than just maintaining access.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving through a network, often to find specific data or systems to exploit. The use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across a compromised network fits well within this definition, especially after the attacker has already gained elevated privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes actions taken after the initial compromise and privilege escalation, focusing on the spread of the attack within the network.
   - The tools mentioned (PsExec and WinExe) are commonly used for executing commands and programs on remote systems, which aligns with moving laterally within a network.
   - Given the context of spreading across the network after gaining domain administrator privileges, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: D
