To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a downloader (MSIL/Crimson) has successfully downloaded a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) from a specified host. The focus is on what happens after the RAT is executed, specifically in terms of communicating with its servers using a custom TCP protocol. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely follows this execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the "Command and Control" tactic. Specifically, they involve:
   - **T1071.001 - Web Protocols**: Using web protocols for command and control, which could involve communicating over HTTP/S.
   - **T1571 - Non-Standard Port**: Using non-standard ports for communication, which could be part of evading detection.
   - **T1095 - Non-Application Layer Protocol**: Using protocols that are not typically used at the application layer for command and control, which could include custom TCP protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Given that the question focuses on the communication between the executed RAT and its servers using a custom TCP protocol, we need to find the ATT&CK tactic that best aligns with this activity. 
   - **A: Persistence** refers to the tactics used by an adversary to maintain their presence within a network. While important, this doesn't directly relate to the communication aspect.
   - **B: Exfiltration** involves the transfer of data from the target system to the adversary. This could be a goal of the RAT but doesn't directly describe the communication method.
   - **C: Command and Control** directly involves the communication between the RAT and the adversary's servers, which can include using custom protocols for sending commands and receiving data.
   - **D: Execution** refers to the tactics used to execute malicious code, which has already occurred in the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: 
   - The scenario describes the RAT communicating with its servers after being executed.
   - The communication is via a custom TCP protocol, which aligns with techniques under the Command and Control tactic, such as using non-standard protocols or ports for communication.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic following the execution of the RAT, given the context of communicating with custom TCP protocol to its servers, is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
