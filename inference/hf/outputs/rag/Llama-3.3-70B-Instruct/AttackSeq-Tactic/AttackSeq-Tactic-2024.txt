To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved in the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 (Command and Control) method before executing malicious payloads generated from Cobalt Strike. This implies a step in the attack sequence where the adversary sets up a way to communicate with the compromised system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all under the "Execution" tactic and involve the use of command and scripting interpreters, specifically PowerShell and Python. These are techniques used to execute code on a compromised system, but they don't directly relate to setting up C2 channels or "Listeners."

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
    - **Impact (A)**: This tactic involves the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. Setting up "Listeners" for C2 doesn't fit here.
    - **Execution (B)**: While the related TTPs are under this tactic, the question specifically asks about deploying "Listeners" for C2, which is more about establishing communication rather than executing code.
    - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This involves techniques used to gain higher privileges on a system. Setting up C2 "Listeners" doesn't directly relate to escalating privileges.
    - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the initial vectors used by an adversary to gain access to a network. However, setting up "Listeners" for C2 is more about maintaining access and controlling the compromised system rather than the initial entry point.

However, considering the context of setting up "Listeners" for C2, which is crucial for maintaining communication with the compromised system, we need to think about which phase this action supports. The deployment of "Listeners" is actually more closely related to the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic, which isn't listed among the choices. C2 is about establishing and maintaining a communication channel between the adversary and the compromised system. Since C2 isn't an option, we must choose the closest related tactic based on the provided options and the understanding that "Listeners" are part of setting up a C2 channel, which is essential for executing further commands and maintaining access.

Given the options and understanding the role of "Listeners" in the context of Cobalt Strike (a tool often used for post-exploitation and C2), the closest tactic related to the deployment of such "Listeners" before executing malicious payloads would be related to how adversaries interact with the system post-initial access. However, the question's framing and the provided options don't perfectly align with the typical ATT&CK framework's C2 tactic. 

In the context of the ATT&CK framework and the question's specifics, the tactic that most closely aligns with the actions described (considering the typical use of Cobalt Strike and the deployment of "Listeners" for C2) would be related to how an adversary executes their attack post-initial access, considering the "Listeners" are part of establishing a C2 channel which is crucial for command execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: 
- The question asks about deploying "Listeners" for C2 before executing malicious payloads.
- The related TTPs focus on execution techniques.
- The closest ATT&CK tactic related to the question's context, given the options, should involve the phase where setting up C2 "Listeners" would be most relevant.
- Since C2 isn't an option, and considering the execution of malicious payloads is dependent on establishing a C2 channel, the tactic that involves the execution of commands and scripts (which would follow the establishment of C2) is the closest in the sequence of actions described.

Final Answer: B
