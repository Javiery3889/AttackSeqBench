To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) has already gained persistence on a victim's system by executing as a service. It then communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server using an IP address, which complicates direct access for researchers. The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This involves using a proxy to indirect command and control traffic.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This involves maintaining persistence by running as a Windows service.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The scenario describes the RAT communicating with a C2 server, which directly relates to the **Command and Control** tactic. The use of an IP address argument to the service for communication complicates direct access, suggesting techniques that involve indirect communication or obscuring the C2 channel.
   - **Discovery (A)** is about the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system or network, which doesn't directly relate to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **Credential Access (B)** involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the scenario.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D)** is about gaining higher privileges, which, while potentially relevant to the RAT's activities, is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - Given the context, **Command and Control (C)** is the most relevant tactic because it directly involves communication with a C2 server, and the scenario's details about complicating direct access align with techniques under this tactic, such as using proxies or multi-stage channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario focuses on the communication between the RAT and the C2 server.
   - The use of an IP address argument for this communication suggests an attempt to obscure or complicate the detection of this communication.
   - The provided TTPs support the idea that Command and Control tactics are being employed to maintain communication between the RAT and the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic in this scenario is related to maintaining command and control over the compromised system.

Final Answer: C
