To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT10 achieved persistence on victim networks, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that APT10 achieved persistence on victim networks by using scheduled tasks or Windows services after deploying malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access. This indicates that the attackers had already gained access to the network and were in the process of establishing a persistent presence.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are under the Persistence tactic, specifically techniques related to scheduled tasks (T1053.005) and Windows services. This confirms that the attackers used these methods to maintain their access over time.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development and acquisition of resources, such as malware or infrastructure, that can be used to support operations. While resource development is crucial for an attack, it doesn't directly precede the establishment of persistence in the context provided.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection and defense mechanisms. Defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, including during the establishment of persistence, but it's not the tactic that directly precedes persistence in a logical attack sequence.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a victim's system, which could be a step towards establishing persistence but is more about the action of running the malware rather than the result of achieving persistence.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network, which logically precedes the establishment of persistence. For APT10 to use scheduled tasks or Windows services for persistence, they would first need to gain initial access to the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already deployed malware and are establishing persistence.
   - The related TTPs focus on persistence techniques.
   - Logically, before achieving persistence, an attacker must first gain access to the network.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur before achieving persistence is gaining **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: D
