To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where employees were socially engineered into enabling macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware. After the malware installation, but before the adversaries started using BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement, we need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement**, with the technique **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**. This suggests movement within the network.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance**, with the technique **T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**. This implies gathering information about the target.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access**, with the technique **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**. This is about gaining initial access to the system.

   However, none of these directly address the communication between malware and an external server after initial access but before lateral movement and credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the malware and the adversary's command and control server. It is essential for receiving commands, sending stolen data, and controlling the malware's actions within the compromised network. Given that the malware (BlackEnergy 3) needs to communicate with an external server to receive commands or send data, this tactic fits the scenario described.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic is about the adversary trying to gather information about the system and network. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the communication between the malware and an external server.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system and data. It's more about the effect the adversary wants to achieve rather than the communication mechanism.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic is focused on gathering data, which might involve communication with an external server, but it's more about the purpose (collecting data) than the communication mechanism itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that facilitated communication between the malware and an external server after the initial infection but before the adversaries began using plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - The provided TTPs give context about initial access and potential actions within the network but don't directly address the communication aspect.
   - The Command and Control tactic is the most relevant to facilitating communication between the malware and an external server, as it involves the mechanisms by which the adversary controls the malware and receives or sends data.

Final Answer: A
