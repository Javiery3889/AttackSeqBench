To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor established communication with its C2 server, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the Milestone backdoor has already established communication with its Command and Control (C2) server and has sent information about current sessions on the system. This indicates an initial stage of compromise where the attacker is gathering information about the system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the C2 server, which has already happened according to the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This involves the attacker gathering information about the system's network connections, which aligns with sending information about current sessions on the system.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This involves the attacker transferring data from the compromised system to the C2 server, which could be a next step after gathering system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control** has already occurred as the backdoor has established communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** is a strong candidate because the backdoor sending information about current sessions on the system fits within the discovery phase, where attackers gather information about the system and its environment.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** is not directly related to the information provided, as it involves moving from one system to another within the network, which is not indicated in the scenario.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration** could be a subsequent step after discovery, as the attacker might use the gathered information to decide what data to exfiltrate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question indicates that the initial communication and information gathering have occurred.
   - The most logical next step after establishing C2 and gathering initial system information (like current sessions) would be to continue the **Discovery** phase to understand the system and network better before proceeding with other tactics like lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial communication and information sending is **Discovery**, as it aligns with the attacker's need to gather more information about the system and its network connections before proceeding with further malicious activities.

Final Answer: B
