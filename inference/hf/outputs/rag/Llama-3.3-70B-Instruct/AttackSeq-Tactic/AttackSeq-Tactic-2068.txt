To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Derusbi, a type of malware, gathers host information and sends it back via network beacons. It then binds to a random source port and communicates with a preconfigured destination port 443. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Command and Control" and the technique "T1571-Non-Standard Port". This suggests that the communication method used by the malware involves non-standard ports for command and control purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the malware and its command and control server. The use of network beacons and communicating with a preconfigured port (in this case, port 443, which is commonly used for HTTPS) fits within this tactic. The fact that it binds to a random source port and uses a non-standard method (as indicated by T1571) for communication aligns with command and control techniques.
   - **Collection (B)**: While the malware does gather host information, the question focuses on the communication method after the information is gathered, not the act of gathering itself.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: There's no indication in the scenario that the malware is attempting to increase its privileges on the system.
   - **Discovery (D)**: Similar to Collection, the act of gathering host information is part of the discovery phase, but the question is about what happens after this information is collected, specifically the communication method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes a communication method used by malware after it has gathered information.
   - The use of network beacons and a preconfigured destination port (port 443) for communication is characteristic of command and control activities.
   - The technique of using a non-standard port (T1571) further supports this, as it's a method used to avoid detection during command and control communications.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic in this scenario is Command and Control.

Final Answer: A
