To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before IndigoZebra used a dropper executable, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a dropper executable is used to drop and execute a backdoor. This action is intended to reduce suspicion by opening a document, implying a social engineering aspect or an attempt to blend in with normal system activity. The backdoor is executed from 'C:\users\public\spools.exe', indicating that the adversary has already gained some level of access to the system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic "Execution" and the technique "T1204.002-Malicious File". This technique involves using a malicious file to execute malicious code. The use of a dropper to execute a backdoor falls under this category, as it involves executing malicious code (the backdoor) through a malicious file (the dropper executable).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system. While the execution of a backdoor can be part of establishing persistence, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before the dropper was used. Persistence is more about maintaining access over time rather than the initial steps of gaining access or executing code.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold on a system. The use of a dropper to execute a backdoor implies that the adversary already has some level of access, as they are able to execute files on the system. Therefore, initial access must have occurred before this point.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing code on a system. The question describes the execution of a backdoor via a dropper, which directly aligns with this tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this execution.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on a system than those initially granted. While privilege escalation could be a necessary step before executing certain types of code, the question does not specifically indicate that higher privileges were required to execute the backdoor from the public directory.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that the adversary first gained **Initial Access** to the system before they could execute the dropper and the backdoor. The use of a dropper to execute a backdoor is a method of executing malicious code, which aligns with the Execution tactic mentioned in the related TTPs, but the question asks for what happened before this execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The adversary needs to gain access to the system before executing any code.
2. The execution of a dropper to deploy a backdoor is part of the Execution tactic.
3. Given that the question asks for the tactic before the execution of the dropper, we look for the tactic that precedes code execution in a typical attack sequence.

**Final Answer**: B
