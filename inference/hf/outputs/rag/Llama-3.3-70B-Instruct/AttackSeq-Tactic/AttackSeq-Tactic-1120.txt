To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor binary, Etumbot, has already achieved persistence by creating a registry entry to run at startup. The focus is on what happens next to maintain communication with its operators through encrypted HTTP requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for command and control communications.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: Although related to registry modifications, this is more about escalating privileges.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This is about maintaining access to a system, which has already been achieved according to the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**: This tactic involves causing direct effects on the system or data, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: Given that the question asks about maintaining communication with operators through encrypted HTTP requests, this choice aligns with the T1071.001 technique under the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: While persistence has already been achieved, the question asks about what happens next to maintain communication, not about maintaining access itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This involves gathering information about the system or network, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining communication with operators.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that persistence has been achieved, so we're looking for the next step in the attack sequence related to communication.
   - The use of encrypted HTTP requests for communication points towards command and control activities.
   - The related TTPs support this, with T1071.001 specifically mentioning web protocols for command and control.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after achieving persistence involves maintaining communication through command and control channels.

Final Answer: B
