To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where EVILNUM, presumably a piece of malware, has already gained access to a system and is taking steps to ensure persistence. It does this by adding a registry key, a technique used to evade detection, specifically tailored to the antivirus software present on the system. After establishing persistence, it communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server using a one-way communication method by sending a GET request to "check.php".

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: This indicates the malware is modifying the registry to avoid being detected, which aligns with the persistence mechanism described.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**: This refers to the method used by the malware to communicate with the C2 server, which is a one-way communication technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Option A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system or network. While collection might occur at some point during the attack, the specific actions described (ensuring persistence and communicating with a C2 server) do not directly relate to the collection of information.
   - **Option B: Discovery**: Discovery involves the attacker trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. The actions described do not directly align with discovery activities.
   - **Option C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the C2 server. The action of sending a GET request to "check.php" for one-way communication directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **Option D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about the initial entry point of the attacker into the system. The scenario described assumes the malware is already inside the system, focusing on persistence and communication rather than initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where the malware has already gained access and is focusing on persistence and communication.
   - The action of modifying the registry for persistence is a defense evasion technique, which is a precursor to the communication with the C2 server.
   - The communication with the C2 server via a one-way communication method is directly related to the Command and Control tactic.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after ensuring persistence and before communicating with the C2 server is not directly listed as an option that perfectly matches the "after" and "before" conditions. However, given the context, the closest match in terms of the sequence of actions (persistence established, followed by communication) suggests that the communication aspect is key.

Given the emphasis on the communication with the C2 server as the next step after persistence, and considering the provided options and the context of the question, the most relevant tactic related to the action of communicating with the C2 server is Command and Control. However, it's crucial to note that the question's phrasing suggests looking for a tactic that occurs "after" persistence is established and "before" the communication with the C2 server, which might imply looking for a tactic that bridges these actions or is concurrent with the preparation for C2 communication.

Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions (persistence and C2 communication) and given the closest alignment with the provided information and the typical flow of an attack, the answer might seem to lean towards Command and Control due to its direct relation to the communication aspect. However, the precise sequence and the specific tactics' timing as described could suggest a focus on the actions immediately following persistence and preceding C2 communication, which might not perfectly align with the options provided in a traditional attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C**
