To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next in the scenario described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a self-extracting wrapper file is used to conceal a Gh0st payload, and after executing the embedded DLL of the Trojan, the malware establishes communication using a custom network protocol through a server hosted at a specific IP address. The key elements here are the use of evasion techniques to deliver the payload and the establishment of communication with a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates the use of web protocols for command and control, which is a method attackers use to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This involves using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection, which aligns with the initial part of the scenario involving a self-extracting wrapper file.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique is about embedding payloads within other files or programs to avoid detection, which is also relevant to the initial delivery method described.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The scenario starts with defense evasion techniques (using a self-extracting wrapper file and an embedded payload) to deliver the Gh0st payload. This matches the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - After the payload is delivered and executed, the malware establishes communication with a C2 server using a custom network protocol. This action is directly related to the **Command and Control** tactic, as it involves communicating with the compromised system to potentially issue commands or exfiltrate data.

Given the sequence of events:
- The initial steps (using a self-extracting wrapper and embedded payload) are about evading defenses, which is **Defense Evasion**.
- The next step, after the malware is executed and establishes communication, is about maintaining control over the compromised system, which aligns with **Command and Control**.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next after the malware established communication with its C2 server.
   - The establishment of communication for command and control purposes directly follows the successful evasion and execution of the malware.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the one that aligns with the establishment of communication between the compromised system and the C2 server.

Final Answer: C
