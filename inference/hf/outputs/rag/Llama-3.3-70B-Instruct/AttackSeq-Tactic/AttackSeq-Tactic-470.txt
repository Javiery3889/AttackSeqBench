To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects were used, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where spear phishing emails with infected attachments (document files containing OLE binary objects) were used to target high-ranking diplomats and academic researchers. This action is a method used by attackers to gain access to a system or network.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses**: This involves gathering information about the target, which could include collecting email addresses for potential phishing attacks. However, this does not directly relate to the action of sending infected emails.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This directly matches the scenario described in the question. Spearphishing with an attachment is a technique used to gain initial access to a system by tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the scenario involves sending spear phishing emails with infected attachments, the most relevant tactic from the provided options is **Initial Access**. This is because the action described (sending spear phishing emails) is a method of attempting to gain access to a system or network.
   - **Defense Evasion** (A) would be relevant after the initial access has been gained, as it involves techniques used to evade detection.
   - **Reconnaissance** (B) might occur before the spear phishing attempt to gather information about the targets, but it's not the immediate next step after the described action.
   - **Execution** (C) could be a part of the process after initial access is gained, as it involves executing malicious code, but the question specifically asks about the tactic most likely to occur after the spear phishing attempt, which is gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The spear phishing attempt with infected attachments is a method of gaining **Initial Access**.
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after this attempt, implying the action of gaining access itself.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic directly related to the action of using spear phishing with attachments to gain access to a system or network.

Final Answer: D
