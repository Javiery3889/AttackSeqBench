To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have dumped Windows cached password hashes, potentially to crack passwords for unauthorized access to additional systems. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as the attackers used these credentials to traverse the network and search for servers hosting sensitive intellectual property.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all under the "Credential Access" tactic, specifically:
   - T1003.005: Cached Domain Credentials
   - T1110.002: Password Cracking
   - T1003: OS Credential Dumping
   These TTPs are about gaining access to credentials, which is a precursor to the action described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network, often using compromised credentials. Given that the attackers are using the dumped and potentially cracked credentials to "traverse the network," this seems like a strong candidate.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic is about gathering information about the system or network. While discovery might occur as part of the process, the primary action described (using credentials to move through the network) doesn't directly align with the discovery tactic.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic has already been accomplished, as indicated by the dumping of password hashes and the intention to crack them. The question asks for the next likely tactic after credential access has been gained.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which might be the ultimate goal but doesn't directly describe the action of moving through the network using compromised credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained access to credentials through dumping and potentially cracking them.
   - The next step involves using these credentials, which implies movement within the network to find specific targets (servers with sensitive intellectual property).
   - Lateral Movement (A) is the tactic that best describes using compromised credentials to move through a network, making it the most plausible next step after gaining credential access.

Final Answer: A
