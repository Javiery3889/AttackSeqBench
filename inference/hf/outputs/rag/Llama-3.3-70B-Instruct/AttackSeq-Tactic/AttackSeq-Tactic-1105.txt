To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after ComboJack ensured persistence by setting a registry key and before it entered an infinite loop checking clipboard contents for cryptocurrency wallet information, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of actions taken by ComboJack, a malware or malicious actor. The actions include ensuring persistence (staying on the system over time) by setting a registry key, which is a method to maintain access to a compromised system. After achieving persistence, the actor enters an infinite loop to check clipboard contents, specifically looking for cryptocurrency wallet information. This action is aimed at collecting sensitive information.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This indicates the actor is collecting data, specifically clipboard data, which aligns with the action of checking clipboard contents for cryptocurrency wallet information.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This shows how the actor ensures persistence by modifying registry keys, which is mentioned in the question as setting a registry key.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the actor has already ensured persistence (by setting a registry key), the tactic of **Persistence (C)** has already occurred and is not what we are looking for as the next step.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A)** involves gaining higher privileges on a system, which is not directly related to the actions described (persistence and clipboard monitoring).
   - **Defense Evasion (D)** involves evading detection, which, while possible, is not directly implied by the actions of monitoring the clipboard for specific data.
   - **Collection (B)** directly aligns with the action of monitoring the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet information, as it involves gathering sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The actor first ensures persistence, which is a prerequisite for long-term data collection.
   - The next logical step, given the context, is to collect sensitive information, which in this case is cryptocurrency wallet information from the clipboard.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after ensuring persistence and before entering an infinite loop to check clipboard contents is **Collection**.

Final Answer: B
