To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells and before running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells. This action is followed by the use of the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This is related to the initial exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, which allowed the attacker to gain access to the system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This involves executing commands on the compromised system, which could be related to the use of the AntSword webshell for running commands.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This is about discovering information about the system owners and users, which aligns with the actions taken after installing the webshell.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic has already occurred, as the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 was the means of gaining initial access.
   - **Credential Access (B)**: While credential access might be a necessary step for further actions, the question does not directly imply that credential access was the immediate next step after installing webshells and before system/user discovery.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This is the tactic that involves gathering information about the system and its users, which is what the attacker does after installing the webshell. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before running commands for system and user discovery.
   - **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves executing commands on the compromised system. Given that the webshell (like AntSword) is used to execute commands for system and user discovery, the execution of these commands would be a direct result of the webshell's capabilities. Therefore, the execution tactic would logically precede the discovery actions mentioned, as it is the means by which those discovery commands are run.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 allows the attacker to install webshells, which is an initial access tactic.
   - The use of the webshell to run commands for system and user discovery implies that the attacker is executing commands on the system.
   - The most direct and immediate tactic before running these discovery commands, given the context, is the execution of commands via the webshell.
   
Final Answer: D
