To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after establishing persistence and before accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The malware has already established persistence through creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks. This indicates the attacker has ensured their malware remains on the system across reboots. The next step involves accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather and send email accounts, which suggests the attacker is looking to collect sensitive information.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification** and **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** confirm the methods used for persistence.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule** is related to the collection of email information, which aligns with accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Impact**: This tactic involves disrupting, modifying, or destroying systems and data. While it could occur at any point, it doesn't directly relate to the actions of gathering email accounts.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves evading detection, which could happen at various stages of the attack but doesn't directly precede the action of collecting email accounts.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining account credentials, which could be a precursor to accessing email accounts. If the attacker needs credentials to access Microsoft Outlook MAPI, this would be a logical step before attempting to gather and send email accounts.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, which might not directly relate to the immediate action of accessing email accounts.

Given the context, the most logical sequence is that after establishing persistence, the attacker would need to obtain the necessary credentials to access Microsoft Outlook MAPI before they can gather and send email accounts. Thus, **Credential Access** is the most plausible tactic that occurred before accessing email accounts.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attacker establishes persistence.
2. To access sensitive areas like email accounts, the attacker likely needs credentials.
3. Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather and send email accounts requires authorization, which aligns with the need for credential access.

**Final Answer: C**
