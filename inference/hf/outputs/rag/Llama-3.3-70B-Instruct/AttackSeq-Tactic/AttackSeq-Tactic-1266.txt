To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers and before they executed sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary, TG1021, uses deserialization attacks to exploit Windows IIS servers. This action is a form of exploiting a public-facing application, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic. After this initial exploitation, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This TTP is directly related to the initial action described in the question, where deserialization attacks are used to exploit public-facing Windows IIS servers.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This TTP indicates a method used to evade defenses, which could be relevant after initial access and before or during the execution of malware to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This is the tactic used to gain an initial foothold on the system, which has already been accomplished by exploiting the IIS servers.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)**: After gaining initial access, an adversary would likely attempt to escalate privileges to move laterally or to execute malware with higher privileges. This could be a plausible step before executing sophisticated malware.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malware or other code on the system, which is the final step mentioned in the question. It's what the adversary does after they have the necessary access and privileges.
   - **Persistence (D)**: While important for long-term access, persistence might not be the immediate next step before executing malware, especially if the malware itself is designed to be memory-resident and ephemeral.

Given the context, after the initial access is gained through exploiting public-facing applications, and before executing sophisticated memory-resident malware, the adversary would likely need to ensure they have sufficient privileges to execute their malware effectively. This makes **Privilege Escalation** a critical step in the attack sequence described.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190).
2. To effectively execute sophisticated malware, especially if it's memory-resident, the adversary would need to ensure they have the necessary privileges.
3. The execution of malware (including memory-resident malware) would follow after the adversary has secured the appropriate level of access and privileges.

**Final Answer**: B
