To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Dragonfly attackers used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to energy companies. This implies we are looking for a tactic that precedes the initial access phase, particularly focusing on the context of spear-phishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are all related to the "Initial Access" tactic and specifically involve phishing techniques (T1566), with sub-techniques including spear-phishing link (T1566.002) and spear-phishing attachment (T1566.001). These are methods used by attackers to initially gain access to a system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development and acquisition of resources, such as infrastructure, tools, and personnel, necessary for operations. While it's a crucial part of an attacker's lifecycle, it doesn't directly precede the initial access in terms of immediate tactical sequence related to the specific action of spear-phishing.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised system. It occurs after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, including after initial access, it's not typically what precedes the initial access phase in a logical sequence of attack tactics.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which can include identifying potential vulnerabilities, network mapping, and gathering information that could be used for phishing campaigns. Reconnaissance logically precedes initial access, as it provides the necessary information for crafting effective spear-phishing emails.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of spear-phishing emails to gain initial access, indicating a targeted approach that likely relied on prior information gathering.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of phishing techniques for initial access, suggesting that the attackers had some level of knowledge about their targets.
   - Reconnaissance (D) is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which would be necessary for crafting effective spear-phishing emails. It logically precedes the initial access phase and aligns with the context provided.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that reconnaissance occurred before the initial access via spear-phishing.

Final Answer: D
