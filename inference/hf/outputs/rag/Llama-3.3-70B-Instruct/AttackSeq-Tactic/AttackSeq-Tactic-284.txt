To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before cybercriminals developed and sold hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers accompanied by training services on the Chinese underground market, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question focuses on the development and sale of specific hardware tools (PoS and ATM skimmers) along with training services. This implies a level of preparation and resource gathering before these activities could take place.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This involves gaining access to a system or network by compromising the hardware supply chain, which could be relevant to the creation and distribution of compromised hardware like skimmers.
   - **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.001-Malware** and **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: These techniques are about developing resources (in this case, malware) that could be used in various stages of an attack, including those involving compromised hardware.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves the development and acquisition of resources, such as malware, tools, or infrastructure, necessary for operations. Given that the question mentions the development and sale of specialized hardware (skimmers) and training services, it suggests a preceding phase of resource development where these tools and possibly accompanying malware were created or acquired.
   - **Reconnaissance (B)**: While reconnaissance is a crucial initial step in many attack sequences, the question's focus on the development and sale of specific tools and services suggests that the initial information gathering phase has already occurred.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems or devices, which would be more relevant after the deployment of the skimmers rather than before their development and sale.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: Exfiltration involves the removal of data from a target system, which is not directly related to the development and sale of hardware tools and training services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The development and sale of specialized hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services, imply a level of preparation and resource gathering.
   - The related TTPs highlight the importance of resource development in creating or acquiring necessary tools and malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that **Resource Development** occurred before the cybercriminals could develop and sell such hardware and services.

Final Answer: A
