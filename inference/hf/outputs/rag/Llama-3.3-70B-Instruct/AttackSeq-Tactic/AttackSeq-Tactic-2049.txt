To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where iOS malware has been installed on compromised systems. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred after the malware installation but before the collection of specific data types such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This suggests that the malware is trying to avoid detection by removing indicators that could be used to detect its presence.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This indicates the collection of data from the local system, which aligns with the gathering of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This involves the malware discovering system information, which could be a step before collecting more specific data types.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which could be relevant to the installation of the malware but doesn't directly relate to the actions taken after installation and before data collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**: This tactic is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, which doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: While command and control communications are crucial for malware operations, the question focuses on actions taken after installation and before specific data collection, which might not necessarily involve command and control as the primary next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: Given that the malware needs to understand its environment before collecting specific data, discovering system information (T1082) fits well as a step that would occur after the malware is installed and before it starts gathering specific data like text messages and geo-location data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware is installed on compromised systems.
   - Before collecting specific data, the malware would likely need to understand its environment and what data is available.
   - The **Discovery** tactic, specifically through techniques like **T1082-System Information Discovery**, aligns with this need to understand the system before collecting specific data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the malware installation and before the collection of specific data, the malware would engage in **Discovery** to understand what data is available for collection.

Final Answer: D
