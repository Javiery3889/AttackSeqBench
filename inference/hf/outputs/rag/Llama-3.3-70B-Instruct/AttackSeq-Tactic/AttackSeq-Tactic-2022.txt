To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the SOCKSBOT implant ensured persistence, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SOCKSBOT implant has already achieved persistence by creating a Windows service named 'Check for updates' and has reflectively loaded itself to spoof legitimate services. This action is clearly aimed at maintaining access to the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This indicates the use of Windows services to maintain persistence on a system. The action described in the question (creating a Windows service) aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: Although this TTP mentions privilege escalation using Windows services, the question does not explicitly mention actions aimed at escalating privileges but rather focuses on persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion could be a subsequent tactic to avoid detection, the question specifically mentions actions related to persistence, not evasion techniques.
   - **B: Command and Control**: After establishing persistence, an attacker would likely establish a command and control (C2) channel to issue commands to the compromised system. This is a plausible next step after ensuring persistence.
   - **C: Persistence**: The question already states that persistence has been achieved, so this is not the next likely tactic.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. While this could be a subsequent action, the question does not provide information suggesting movement between systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes achieving persistence through creating a Windows service.
   - The related TTPs support the use of Windows services for persistence.
   - Given that persistence is already established, the next logical step in an attack sequence would be to establish a means of controlling the compromised system, which aligns with Command and Control.
   
Final Answer: B
