To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after T9000 delivered its initial payload via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an initial payload is delivered via an RTF (Rich Text Format) file. This file exploits two specific vulnerabilities, CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641, to execute malicious code. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this initial payload delivery.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the exploitation of a vulnerability in client software to execute malicious code. The use of CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 to deliver the payload aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This involves using malicious files to execute code. The RTF file used in the initial payload delivery fits this description.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment (like an RTF file) to gain initial access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the initial payload has already been delivered and executed (exploiting vulnerabilities and using a malicious file), the next logical step in the attack sequence would involve establishing a foothold or preparing for further malicious activities.
   - **D: Initial Access** is the tactic that has already occurred, as the attackers have successfully delivered and executed their payload, gaining access to the system.
   - **B: Execution** is also part of what has already happened, as the malicious code has been executed to deliver the payload.
   - **A: Credential Access** could be a subsequent step but isn't directly implied by the exploitation of vulnerabilities for code execution.
   - **C: Persistence** is a tactic that would likely follow initial access and execution, as it involves techniques to maintain access to the system, which is a common next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained **Initial Access** through exploiting vulnerabilities and executing malicious code.
   - The next logical step after gaining access and executing code would be to ensure they can maintain that access over time.
   - **Persistence** tactics are used to keep access to the system, which aligns with the post-exploitation phase of an attack.
   - Therefore, after delivering the initial payload and executing malicious code, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic is **Persistence**.

Final Answer: C
