To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through email attachments with malicious VBA macros. After this initial access, Sednit's Delphi downloader sends gathered system information to a Command and Control (C&C) server using a command that executes `SYSTEMINFO` and `TASKLIST` commands via `cmd.exe`. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Initial Access** via **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**, which aligns with the initial access method described in the question.
   - **Execution** tactics, specifically:
     - **T1059.001 - PowerShell**: This technique involves executing PowerShell commands, which is not directly mentioned in the scenario but indicates a method of execution.
     - **T1059.005 - Visual Basic**: This involves using Visual Basic (VB) for execution, which aligns with the use of VBA macros for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. The action of sending gathered information (via `SYSTEMINFO` and `TASKLIST`) to a C&C server implies that some form of reconnaissance has occurred to gather this information.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within a network. The scenario does not directly imply movement between systems; it focuses on the execution of commands on a compromised system.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on a compromised system. Given that the scenario describes the execution of `cmd.exe` with specific commands, this is a strong candidate. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this execution.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the tactic used to gain initial access to a system, which has already been described as happening through email attachments with malicious VBA macros.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario starts with initial access through malicious VBA macros, which corresponds to **Initial Access**.
   - After gaining access, for the attacker to send system information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`, they would first need to execute some form of code or command to gather or prepare this information. This action of executing code (in this case, likely facilitated by the malicious VBA macros or subsequent payloads) aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
   - However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the described execution and data sending. Given that **Initial Access** has already occurred and the question implies a sequence where execution is happening to facilitate sending system information, the most logical preceding tactic related to the described action (but not directly the execution of `cmd.exe` commands) would be **Reconnaissance**. This is because the attacker needs to gather system information (which is a form of reconnaissance) before they can send it to the C&C server.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before sending the gathered information, considering the context provided, is **Reconnaissance**, as it directly relates to the gathering of system information (`SYSTEMINFO` and `TASKLIST`) that is then sent to the C&C server.

Final Answer: A
