To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after gaining initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks, an attacker (referred to as NewsBeef) utilized PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers. This indicates a sequence of actions where initial access has already been achieved, and the attacker is now executing further actions within the compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates the use of PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which is a method used by the attacker in the question to download poisoned installers.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This refers to gaining initial access to a system through a drive-by compromise, which aligns with the spearphishing and watering hole attacks mentioned in the question as methods of initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Initial Access (C)** has already been achieved through spearphishing and watering hole attacks, so it's not what occurred before the utilization of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)** refers to the movement within a network to gain access to additional systems or data, which is not directly implied by the use of PowerShell to download installers.
   - **Discovery (A)** involves the attacker learning more about the system or network, which could potentially happen after initial access but is not directly related to the action of using PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers.
   - **Execution (B)** directly relates to the action of using PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers, as it involves executing commands or scripts on a compromised system.

Given the context, the most logical sequence is that after gaining **Initial Access**, the next step that aligns with using PowerShell scripts (Execution) would indeed be an **Execution** tactic, as it directly involves running commands or scripts (in this case, PowerShell scripts) to achieve a specific goal (downloading poisoned installers).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained.
2. The attacker then uses the access to execute commands or scripts (in this case, PowerShell scripts) to further their goals, such as downloading poisoned installers.

**Final Answer**: B
