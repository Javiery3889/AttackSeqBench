To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers use spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access to a victim's system. After gaining access, they use an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers employed this method to gather software information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   These TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing techniques, specifically spear phishing with attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before attempting to breach it. However, in the context of the question, reconnaissance could also refer to the act of gathering information after initial access, such as discovering software installed on the system.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on the victim's system, which could be relevant to using an undocumented Word feature but doesn't directly relate to gathering information about installed software as a precursor.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This is the tactic used to gain entry into the system, which has already been accomplished according to the question.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means to control the compromised system, which might not directly relate to the act of gathering software information.

Given the context, the attackers have already gained initial access (C) and are now gathering information about the system, which suggests they are in the process of understanding the environment before potentially moving laterally or executing further malicious actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before employing an undocumented Word feature to gather software information.
   - The attackers have already gained initial access through spear phishing.
   - The act of gathering information about the software installed can be seen as part of the reconnaissance phase, especially if it's about understanding the target environment better after initial access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers would engage in reconnaissance to gather more information about the system before proceeding with other tactics like execution or command and control.

Final Answer: A
