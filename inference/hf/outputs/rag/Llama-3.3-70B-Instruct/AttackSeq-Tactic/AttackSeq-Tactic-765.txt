To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved in obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the Darkhotel APT gained initial access. This implies a phase of gathering information prior to the actual attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include Defense Evasion and Initial Access tactics. Specifically, the technique T1036.005 (Match Legitimate Name or Location) under Defense Evasion suggests an attempt to blend in or gather information that matches legitimate entities, which could be used for targeting. The technique T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain) under Initial Access indicates a method of gaining access by compromising software updates or distribution channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development** is about preparing for an operation but doesn't directly relate to gathering victim-specific information.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** involves gathering information about the target, which aligns with obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay, before launching an attack.
   - **C: Initial Access** refers to the tactic used to gain an initial foothold within a network, which in this case is mentioned as deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates, but it doesn't directly involve gathering information about the victims' locations.
   - **D: Command and Control** is about maintaining control over a compromised system, which happens after initial access, not before.

Given the context, **Reconnaissance** is the most fitting tactic for obtaining knowledge about the victims before the attack. This involves gathering information that could be used to plan and execute a targeted attack, such as knowing where potential victims are staying.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the tactic involved in obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the attack.
   - Reconnaissance is the phase where attackers gather information about their targets.
   - The related TTPs suggest techniques that could be used in conjunction with reconnaissance to make the attack more targeted and effective.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gathering information about the targets.

Final Answer: B
