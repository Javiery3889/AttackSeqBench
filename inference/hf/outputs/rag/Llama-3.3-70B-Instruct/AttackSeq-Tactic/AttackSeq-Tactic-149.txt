To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Harvester deployed a custom downloader, set a registry value for persistence, and attempted to blend malicious activities with legitimate network traffic, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, referred to as Harvester, has already taken several actions:
   - Deployed a custom downloader: This action suggests the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system and is looking to download additional malicious tools or payloads.
   - Set a registry value for persistence: This indicates the attacker is trying to maintain access to the system over time, suggesting a focus on establishing a foothold.
   - Attempted to blend malicious activities with legitimate network traffic: This implies the attacker is trying to evade detection by making their malicious traffic appear as normal as possible.

2. **Analysis of Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are all related to the tactic of Defense Evasion:
   - **T1036.005 - Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves masquerading files or directories to blend in with legitimate system files or directories.
   - **T1036.004 - Masquerade Task or Service**: This involves disguising a malicious task or service as a legitimate one to avoid detection.
   - **T1562.006 - Indicator Blocking**: This technique is about blocking indicators that might be used to detect the attacker's presence, further evading detection.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given the actions described (deploying a custom downloader, setting a registry value for persistence, and attempting to blend malicious activities with legitimate traffic), and considering the related TTPs focused on Defense Evasion, we can infer that the attacker's primary goal at this stage is to avoid being detected. The actions taken and the techniques mentioned all point towards evading security measures and maintaining stealth.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The deployment of a custom downloader and setting a registry value for persistence are initial steps in establishing a foothold and preparing for further malicious activities.
   - The attempt to blend malicious activities with legitimate network traffic directly aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, as it aims to prevent detection.
   - The related TTPs further support this, showing various methods used to evade detection, such as masquerading tasks or services and blocking indicators of compromise.

Given this analysis, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after these actions is Defense Evasion, as the attacker is focused on avoiding detection to maintain access and potentially prepare for further malicious activities.

**Final Answer: C**
