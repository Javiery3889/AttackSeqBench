To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving Stuxnet, a sophisticated malware, using rootkit functionality for hiding its presence and employing stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers. This is followed by the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) to spread across networked systems. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during this spreading phase.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This indicates the use of remote services to move laterally within a network, which aligns with exploiting vulnerabilities in networked systems to spread.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing**: This refers to the use of code signing to make malicious code appear legitimate, which is mentioned in the context of using stolen digital certificates.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit**: This involves using rootkits to hide malicious activity, which is also mentioned in the context of Stuxnet's behavior.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While Defense Evasion is relevant to the initial actions of Stuxnet (using rootkits and code signing), the question specifically asks about the tactic involved in exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - **B: Execution**: Execution refers to the tactic of running malicious code, which is a part of the attack but not directly related to the spreading mechanism described.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic directly involves moving within a network, which aligns with the exploitation of vulnerabilities to spread across systems.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the malware and its command and control server, which is not directly related to the spreading mechanism described.

Given the context of exploiting vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) to spread across networked systems, the most relevant tactic is **Lateral Movement**, as it directly involves the exploitation of remote services (T1210) to move within a network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the key actions described: Stuxnet uses evasion techniques (rootkit and code signing) and then exploits specific vulnerabilities.
2. Determine the purpose of these actions: The initial actions are for evasion, but the question focuses on the spreading behavior.
3. Match the spreading behavior with the provided TTPs: Exploiting vulnerabilities to spread matches with Lateral Movement, specifically through the exploitation of remote services.

**Final Answer**: C
