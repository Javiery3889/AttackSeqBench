To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Black Energy 2 malware, after establishing communication with its Command and Control (C&C) server and receiving configuration files, uses its plugins to create significant loads on target servers. This results in a denial-of-service effect through mass connections and random data packets.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control**, with the technique **T1071.001-Web Protocols**. This refers to the use of web protocols (like HTTP) for communication between the malware and its C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Impact**, with the technique **T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**. This refers to the action of making a system or service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic, in this case, from the endpoint (the compromised machine running the malware).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**. This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and its C&C server, which is mentioned in the setup of the question but does not directly relate to the action of creating significant loads on target servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**. This tactic involves the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. Given that the malware's plugins are creating significant loads on target servers, leading to a denial-of-service effect, this aligns closely with the Impact tactic, specifically the Endpoint Denial of Service technique (T1499).
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**. This tactic involves the adversary's actions to maintain their presence within the system. While important for the overall lifecycle of an attack, it does not directly relate to the action of overwhelming target servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**. This tactic involves the actions taken to move laterally within a network, which does not directly relate to the described action of creating loads on target servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the malware's action of creating significant loads on target servers, which aligns with the concept of disrupting or making a system unavailable.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of web protocols for C&C and the technique of endpoint denial of service, which directly relates to the described action.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that matches the scenario described is related to the Impact tactic, as it involves disrupting the availability of the target servers.

Final Answer: B
