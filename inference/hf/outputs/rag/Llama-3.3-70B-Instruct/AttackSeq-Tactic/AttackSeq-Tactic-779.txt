To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers first execute a PowerShell loader via an Internet Explorer exploit vector. This action is followed by the use of an LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) binary that exploits CVE-2019-1458 to gain system privileges. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used the LPE binary.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This suggests the initial method of gaining access to the system, which aligns with the Internet Explorer exploit vector mentioned in the question.
   - **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This is directly related to the action of using an LPE binary to exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458) for gaining system privileges.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This involves executing code on the system, which aligns with the execution of the PowerShell loader.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the privilege escalation using the LPE binary. Given that the attackers have already executed a PowerShell loader (which falls under Execution), we need to consider what typically happens after initial access and before privilege escalation in an attack sequence.
   - **Initial Access** would have occurred first, as it involves gaining an entry point into the system, which is achieved through the Internet Explorer exploit.
   - **Execution** of the PowerShell loader is mentioned as an action taken by the attackers, which would be a step after initial access and before attempting to escalate privileges. This is because executing malicious code (like a PowerShell loader) is often a precursor to further malicious activities, including privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first gain **Initial Access** through an exploit.
   - They then **Execute** code (the PowerShell loader) on the compromised system.
   - Before attempting **Privilege Escalation** using the LPE binary, the most relevant tactic from the provided options that aligns with the sequence of executing code (PowerShell loader) is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: C**
