To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the BLUELIGHT malware established communication with the C2 server, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where legitimate files on a website are modified to redirect users to attacker-controlled domains for exploiting Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. This action leads to the deployment of BLUELIGHT malware, which then establishes communication with a Command and Control (C2) server using Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive directories.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This indicates the initial method used by the attackers to gain access to the system. Exploiting public-facing applications, in this case, Internet Explorer vulnerabilities, is a common initial access technique.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that data exfiltration occurred over the established C2 channel, which is a step that would logically follow after the malware has been deployed and is communicating with the C2 server.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This refers to the communication between the malware (BLUELIGHT) and the C2 server, facilitating the exchange of commands and potentially exfiltrated data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the BLUELIGHT malware has already established communication with the C2 server, we are looking for a tactic that precedes this step in the attack sequence.
   - **Command and Control (A)** is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the C2 server, which is what BLUELIGHT has done. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this communication was established.
   - **Impact (B)** refers to the tactics used to disrupt or destroy systems and data. While this could be a goal of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of establishing C2 communication.
   - **Discovery (C)** involves gathering information about the target environment. This could potentially happen after initial access but before the establishment of a stable C2 channel, as understanding the environment can help in evading defenses and choosing the right moment to establish C2.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)** tactics are used to avoid detection by the target's defensive systems. This is a plausible step that could occur after initial access and before or during the establishment of C2 communication, as evading defenses would be crucial for maintaining access and avoiding detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access was gained through exploiting public-facing applications (Internet Explorer vulnerabilities).
   - Before the BLUELIGHT malware could establish communication with the C2 server, it's logical that the attackers would want to ensure they can maintain access without being detected.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)** is the tactic that most likely occurred before the establishment of C2 communication, as it would be essential for the malware to evade detection to successfully communicate with the C2 server and potentially exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: D
