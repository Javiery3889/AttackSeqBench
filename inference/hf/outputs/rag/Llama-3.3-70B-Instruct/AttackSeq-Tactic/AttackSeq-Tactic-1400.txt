To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious browser extension, FriarFox, is delivered via a phishing email. After the delivery, the threat actors contact a command and control (C2) server to retrieve a Scanbox payload. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before contacting the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided include the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link". This indicates that the initial access to the victim's system was gained through spearphishing, which involves sending targeted phishing emails with malicious links to gain access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Given that the malicious browser extension was delivered via a phishing email, which is a method of initial access, this tactic is directly relevant to the initial phase of the attack described.
   - **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While collection might occur at some point during the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the action of delivering a malicious extension and then contacting a C2 server.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the threat actors' C2 server. The question mentions contacting the C2 server as part of the sequence, but we're looking for what happened before this step.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves evading detection by the target's defensive systems. While defense evasion techniques might be used during the attack, the question doesn't specifically imply actions taken to evade defenses before contacting the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The delivery of the malicious FriarFox browser extension via a phishing email is an example of gaining **Initial Access** to the victim's system.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before contacting the command and control server, which implies we are looking for the initial step in the attack sequence described.
   - Given that the phishing email (Spearphishing Link, T1566.002) is a technique under the **Initial Access** tactic, it logically precedes the actions involving communication with a C2 server or other tactics like collection or defense evasion in the context provided.
   
Final Answer: A
