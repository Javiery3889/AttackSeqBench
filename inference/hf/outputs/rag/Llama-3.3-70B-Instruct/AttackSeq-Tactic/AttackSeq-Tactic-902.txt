To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic involved in delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications before achieving persistence through the registry's RUN key. This implies we are looking for the initial stage of an attack where the malware is introduced into the system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Persistence and the technique of using Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001). This technique is used to maintain persistence on a compromised system, which is a later stage of an attack. However, the question is about the delivery method before persistence is established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. It doesn't directly relate to the delivery of malware.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on the target system. While it's closer to the action of delivering malware, it's more about the execution phase rather than the initial access or delivery method.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)**: Similar to Collection, Reconnaissance is about gathering information and does not directly involve delivering malware.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold on the target system. Delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications would fall under this category, as it's a method used to initially gain access to a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic involved in delivering malware before persistence is achieved.
   - Delivering malware through the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is a method of gaining initial access to a system.
   - The tactic that aligns with gaining initial access to a system is **Initial Access**.
   - Therefore, the correct answer choice is the one that corresponds to the Initial Access tactic.

Final Answer: D
