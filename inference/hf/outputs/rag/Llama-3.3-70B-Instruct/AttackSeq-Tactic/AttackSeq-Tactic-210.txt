To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Dropping Elephant gained initial access to high-profile targets. The focus is on the actions taken before the initial access, specifically targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are related to Initial Access, specifically techniques involving drive-by compromise and spearphishing link. These are methods used to gain initial access to a system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**. This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold into a system or network. While the question mentions gaining initial access, it asks for the tactic that occurred before this step, focusing on gathering information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**. This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. It doesn't fit the context of gathering information before initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**. This tactic involves the attacker's actions to learn about the system or network after gaining access. It's not about the pre-access phase of gathering information on targets.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**. This tactic is about gathering information about potential targets before attempting to access them. It aligns with the pre-access phase of targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions actions taken before gaining initial access, with a focus on gathering information about targets.
   - The related TTPs provide context on how initial access might be gained but don't directly address the pre-access information gathering phase.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target before attempting to access it, which fits the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before gaining initial access, especially when focusing on gathering information about targets, is aligned with the Reconnaissance tactic.

Final Answer: D
