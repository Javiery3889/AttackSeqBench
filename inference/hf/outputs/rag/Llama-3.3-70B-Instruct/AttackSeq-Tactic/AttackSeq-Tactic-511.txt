To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after the dropped payload of Crimson RAT was designed for process killing to evade detections, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a scenario where Crimson RAT (a type of malware) is used with the capability to kill processes, likely to evade detection. This action is followed by the mention of functionalities like keylogging and browser credential theft. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next, given these actions.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**: This indicates an initial step where the malware (Crimson RAT) is designed to evade detection, possibly by using environmental keying to blend its malicious activities with normal system behavior.
   - **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This suggests that the attackers are interested in gaining access to credentials, using keylogging as a method to capture user input, potentially for stealing sensitive information like passwords.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**: While command and control (C2) communications are crucial for remote control of malware, the question specifically mentions actions (keylogging and browser credential theft) that are more directly related to gathering sensitive information rather than establishing or maintaining C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**: This choice directly aligns with the mentioned functionalities of keylogging and browser credential theft. Credential Access is the tactic that involves techniques used to obtain credentials like passwords, which matches the described actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement refers to the actions taken to move through a network after gaining initial access. While important, the described actions do not directly imply movement within a network but rather focus on gathering credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**: Collection involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. While keylogging and credential theft are forms of collection, the specific ATT&CK tactic that directly relates to obtaining credentials (like through keylogging) is Credential Access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action of using Crimson RAT for process killing is aimed at evasion.
   - The subsequent actions (keylogging and browser credential theft) are directly related to obtaining sensitive user information.
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of keylogging for credential access.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next, given the context of keylogging and browser credential theft, is **Credential Access**.

Final Answer: B
