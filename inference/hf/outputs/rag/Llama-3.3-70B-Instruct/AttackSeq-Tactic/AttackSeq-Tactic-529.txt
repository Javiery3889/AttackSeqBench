To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Desert Falcons, has already gained initial access to their victims' systems through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks. It mentions that they managed three separate campaigns with different Command and Control (C&C) servers or IPs to maintain control over their victims. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   These TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing and spear-phishing link techniques, which aligns with the information given in the question about the initial access methods used by Desert Falcons.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration** refers to the tactic of extracting data from a victim's system. While exfiltration could be a goal of the attackers, the question focuses on maintaining control over the victims, not on the extraction of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** is the tactic used to gain an initial foothold on a system. The question states that initial access has already been achieved, so this is not the tactic being asked about.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** involves gathering information about the target system or network. While reconnaissance might occur after initial access, the question emphasizes the maintenance of control through separate campaigns and C&C servers, not the gathering of information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** refers to the tactic of establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems for the purpose of controlling them. This tactic aligns with the scenario described, where Desert Falcons use different C&C/IPs to maintain control over their victims across three separate campaigns.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question clearly states that initial access has been gained.
   - The focus is on maintaining control over the victims through separate campaigns and different C&C/IPs.
   - The related TTPs confirm the initial access methods but do not directly relate to the question's focus on maintaining control.
   - Based on the ATT&CK framework, maintaining control and communicating with compromised systems is directly related to the Command and Control tactic.

Final Answer: D
