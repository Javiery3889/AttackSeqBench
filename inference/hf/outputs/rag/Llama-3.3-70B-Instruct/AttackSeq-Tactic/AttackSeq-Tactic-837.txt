To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware, attributed to PROMETHIUM, searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into an archive. This action is followed by sending the encoded and chunked archive to a Command and Control (C2) server. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely follows this step.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to the "Collection" tactic, specifically techniques involving archiving collected data (T1560) and archiving via a custom method (T1560.003). This indicates that the initial steps are focused on gathering and preparing data for exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
    - **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a victim's system, which doesn't directly follow the action of sending data to a C2 server.
    - **Command and Control (B)**: While establishing command and control is crucial for the malware to receive instructions, the act of sending the archive to a C2 server is more about exfiltrating data rather than establishing command and control itself.
    - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which doesn't align with the action of sending compressed files to a C2 server.
    - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic directly involves transferring data from a victim's system to an adversary-controlled system, which aligns with sending an encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
    - The initial steps described involve searching for specific files and archiving them, which falls under data collection.
    - The action of sending these archives to a C2 server is about transferring the collected data out of the victim's network.
    - Given the focus on transferring data to an adversary-controlled server, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic following the described step is exfiltration.

Final Answer: D
