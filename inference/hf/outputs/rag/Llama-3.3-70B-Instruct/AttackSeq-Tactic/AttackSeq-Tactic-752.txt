To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C (Command and Control) server. This action implies that there was a prior collection or gathering of documents, which is a prerequisite for the uploading action described.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This indicates the automatic transfer of data from a system to an external destination, which aligns with the action of uploading harvested documents.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This specifies that the exfiltration occurs over a command and control channel, which matches the context of uploading to a C&C server.
   - **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection**: This implies the automated gathering of data, which would precede the exfiltration of the collected data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**: While command and control is involved in the process (as the documents are uploaded to a C&C server), it is not the tactic that directly precedes the exfiltration in the context provided.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**: Persistence refers to the tactics used by an adversary to maintain access to a system. While important for the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the sequence of collecting and then exfiltrating data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**: Exfiltration is the tactic of transferring data from a system to an external destination. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before exfiltration, not the exfiltration itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target environment. While it is an early stage in the attack lifecycle, the question specifically mentions the uploading of "harvested documents," which suggests a more direct precursor to exfiltration than reconnaissance.

Given the context and the specific mention of "harvested documents" being uploaded, the most logical precursor to exfiltration (uploading the documents) would be the collection of those documents. However, "Collection" is not explicitly listed as an answer choice, but based on the provided options and understanding that collection must precede exfiltration, we can infer the closest related tactic.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question describes an action (uploading harvested documents) that follows data collection.
2. The related TTPs support the idea that exfiltration (uploading) is the tactic being described.
3. Since "Collection" is not an answer choice but is the logical precursor to exfiltration, we must choose the answer that best aligns with the sequence of events leading to exfiltration.

**Final Answer**: D: Reconnaissance
