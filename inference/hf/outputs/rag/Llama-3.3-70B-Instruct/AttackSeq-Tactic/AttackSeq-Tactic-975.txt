To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests. This indicates that the malware, CosmicDuke, is using various protocols for command and control (C2) communications and possibly for updating itself.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This TTP involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communications. The use of HTTP GET requests by CosmicDuke aligns with this technique.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This involves exfiltrating data using non-C2 protocols that are not encrypted. While this could be a subsequent action, it doesn't directly relate to the described use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests for updates and C2.
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This TTP involves using file transfer protocols (like FTP) for C2 communications. The mention of FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates fits this technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The described actions (using FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests) are primarily related to establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system, as well as updating the malware. 
   - **Command and Control (D)** is the most relevant tactic because it directly involves the techniques mentioned (T1071.001 and T1071.002), which are about using web protocols and file transfer protocols for C2 communications.
   - **Exfiltration (A)** could be a subsequent action but doesn't directly follow from the described use of protocols for malware updates and C2.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)** is not directly related to the use of protocols for C2 and updates.
   - **Resource Development (C)** is not explicitly mentioned in the context of the provided TTPs and the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the tactics used by CosmicDuke after it has established communication and update mechanisms.
   - The use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests points towards command and control activities.
   - Given the TTPs, the most relevant tactic after such activities would still be related to maintaining or utilizing the established C2 channel.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the tactic of **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: D
