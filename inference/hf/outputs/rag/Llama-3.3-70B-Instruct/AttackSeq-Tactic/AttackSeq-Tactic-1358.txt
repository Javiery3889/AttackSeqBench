To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in using Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands before a malicious Word document created persistence. This implies we are looking for a tactic related to executing code or commands on a victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: 
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.002-Office Test**: This indicates a method used to maintain access to a system, specifically through Office applications.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This directly mentions the use of DDE for executing commands, which aligns with the question's context of using DDE to execute PowerShell commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network, which doesn't directly relate to the execution of commands via DDE.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic directly involves executing malicious code or commands on a system, which aligns with using DDE to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or harm the system or data, which is not directly related to the execution of commands via DDE.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which might involve executing code but is broader and not as directly related to the specific method of using DDE as the Execution tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands, which is a method of executing code on a victim's system.
   - The related TTPs highlight the Execution tactic with the technique of using Dynamic Data Exchange, directly supporting the use of DDE for command execution.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described involves the Execution tactic, as it directly pertains to executing commands or code on a system.

Final Answer: B
