To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider, which eventually leads to the execution of the EVILNUM malware. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred at the point when the victim was enticed to follow the link.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:
   - **Tactic: Execution**, with techniques including **T1204.002 (Malicious File)** and **T1204.001 (Malicious Link)**. These techniques involve executing malicious files or links to achieve execution.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with the technique **T1036 (Masquerading)**, which involves disguising malware or malicious activity to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question specifically mentions the victim being enticed to follow a link, which directly relates to **T1204.001 (Malicious Link)** under the **Execution** tactic. However, the act of enticing a victim to follow a link is more about gaining access to the system rather than executing code.
   - **Initial Access** (Choice C) is the tactic that involves successfully establishing a foothold within a network or system. This can be achieved through various means, including phishing (which could involve enticing a victim to follow a malicious link).
   - **Execution** (Choice B) refers to the tactic of executing malicious code, which happens after the initial access has been gained.
   - **Discovery** (Choice A) and **Persistence** (Choice D) are not directly related to the initial act of enticing a victim to follow a link.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario begins with the victim being enticed to follow a link, which is a method used to gain initial access to a system.
   - The techniques provided (especially T1204.001 - Malicious Link) support the idea that the initial step involves getting the victim to engage with a malicious resource.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this initial step of enticing a victim to follow a link is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: C
