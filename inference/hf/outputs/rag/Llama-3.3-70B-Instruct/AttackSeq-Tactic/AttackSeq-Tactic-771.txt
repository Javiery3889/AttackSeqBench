To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically the Darkhotel APT, uses digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypts gathered data in log files. After these actions, the attacker targets stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these initial steps.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**, with the technique **T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**. This indicates the attacker is interested in obtaining credentials from web browsers, which aligns with targeting stored secrets and credentials.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**, with techniques **T1553.002-Code Signing** (using digital certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate) and **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File** (encrypting files to hide malicious activity). These techniques are used to evade detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial actions described (using digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypting gathered data) align with **Defense Evasion** tactics, specifically techniques T1553.002 and T1027.013.
   - The subsequent action of targeting stored secrets and credentials from browsers and email services directly points to **Credential Access**, particularly technique T1555.003.

Given this sequence, the attacker first evades detection (using Defense Evasion tactics) and then focuses on obtaining credentials (Credential Access). The question asks for the tactic that "most likely occurred" after the evasion and encryption steps, which are aimed at setting up a covert presence and gathering specific data (credentials).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial steps (evading detection and encrypting data) are about setting up and maintaining access without being detected, which is crucial for the subsequent steps.
   - The main goal after these setup steps, as described, is to target and gather credentials, which directly aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence after evading detection and encrypting gathered data is to access credentials, making **D: Credential Access** the most appropriate answer.

Final Answer: D
