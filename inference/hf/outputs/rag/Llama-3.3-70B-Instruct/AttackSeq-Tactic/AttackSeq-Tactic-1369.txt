To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN13 exploited external servers, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FIN13, presumably an adversary group, has already gained initial access to victim networks by exploiting external servers. They deployed web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this initial exploitation.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs include:
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This indicates the use of web shells to maintain persistence within the compromised environment. Web shells are a common tool for maintaining access after initial exploitation.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This refers to the initial method used by the adversary to gain access to the victim network, which in this case, involved exploiting external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A: Persistence**: Given that web shells (T1505.003) were deployed, which is a technique under the Persistence tactic, it's logical that after establishing an initial foothold, the next step would involve maintaining that access. Persistence tactics are about keeping access to the compromised system or network, which aligns with the deployment of web shells and custom malware.
   - **Option B: Execution**: While execution of malicious code is certainly a part of the attack sequence, the question specifically asks what happened after the initial exploitation and deployment of malware. Execution would be more related to the initial deployment of the malware rather than a subsequent step.
   - **Option C: Discovery**: Discovery involves the adversary trying to learn more about the environment they've compromised. While this could happen after initial access, the specific actions described (deploying web shells and custom malware) are more directly related to establishing and maintaining access rather than exploring the network.
   - **Option D: Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials is a common goal for attackers, but the question focuses on the immediate aftermath of exploiting external servers and deploying specific malware, which doesn't directly imply credential access as the next logical step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The adversary has already gained initial access and deployed malware to establish a foothold.
   - The use of web shells is directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - Therefore, the most logical next step after gaining initial access and deploying malware would be to ensure continued access to the compromised systems.

Final Answer: A
