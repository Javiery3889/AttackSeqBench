To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after adversaries conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and before they used malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by adversaries. First, they conduct internal reconnaissance, which suggests they are gathering information about the internal workings of the control environment. This is followed by an unspecified tactic, and then they use malicious updates to disrupt connections.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002**: This involves scheduled task/job used for execution, indicating a method for executing code on a system.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001**: This involves gathering credentials, which is part of the reconnaissance phase to gather information that could be used for further access.
   - **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003**: This involves spearphishing links to trick users into revealing sensitive information or gaining initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial action of conducting internal reconnaissance places us in the **Reconnaissance** phase, where adversaries are gathering information.
   - The use of malicious updates to sever connections suggests an action aimed at disrupting or **Impacting** the system's functionality.
   - Between reconnaissance and impact, the adversaries would likely need to establish a presence within the system, potentially move laterally, or take control of certain aspects of the system to effectively use malicious updates.

Given these considerations:
- **A: Impact** is the ultimate goal but doesn't fit as the step immediately after reconnaissance and before using malicious updates.
- **B: Command and Control** could be relevant as it involves establishing control over the compromised systems, which could be necessary before using malicious updates.
- **C: Discovery** is another term for reconnaissance, which has already been established as the initial phase.
- **D: Lateral Movement** involves moving through a network, which could be necessary to reach the point where malicious updates can be effectively used to sever connections.

Considering the sequence and the need for the adversaries to position themselves to use malicious updates effectively, **Lateral Movement** seems the most plausible step after reconnaissance and before impact. This is because lateral movement would allow adversaries to spread through the network, potentially gaining access to systems that could be used to push malicious updates, thereby severing connections as described.

**Final Answer: D**
