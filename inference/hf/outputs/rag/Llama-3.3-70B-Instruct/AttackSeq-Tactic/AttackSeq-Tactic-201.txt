To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers gained initial access and before achieving persistence, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The attackers used compromised email accounts to send malicious Word documents that exploited CVE-2017-0199. This action is described as gaining "initial access." After this, the Helminth Trojan achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task. We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This indicates the exploitation of a vulnerability in client software (in this case, the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199 in Microsoft Word) to execute malicious code.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This refers to the initial method of compromise, where attackers send emails with malicious attachments to gain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial access was gained through spearphishing with a malicious attachment (T1566.001), which led to the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199 for client execution (T1203).
   - After gaining initial access and before achieving persistence (through the Helminth Trojan adding a scheduled task), the attackers would likely need to execute their malicious code or payload to establish a foothold within the system.
   - **Execution (D)** is the tactic that involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which aligns with the exploitation of the vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to run the malicious code.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A)** might be necessary but isn't directly implied as the next step after initial access and before persistence in this context.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)** involves moving from one system to another within the network, which isn't directly indicated by the information provided.
   - **Persistence (B)** is the tactic used by the Helminth Trojan by adding a scheduled task, which is mentioned as happening after the initial access and the exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers gained initial access through spearphishing with a malicious attachment.
   - They exploited a client-side vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) for execution.
   - Before achieving persistence (as indicated by the Helminth Trojan's actions), the most logical step is the execution of the malicious code to establish a foothold.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after initial access and before persistence is **Execution**.

Final Answer: D
