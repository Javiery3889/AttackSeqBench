To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware communicates with command and control (C2) domains using HTTP connections and specific URIs for commands. This communication is used to send stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure. The key elements here are the communication with C2 domains and the exfiltration of sensitive data.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to two tactics:
   - **Command and Control (Tactic)**: This involves techniques used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems, issue commands, and receive stolen data. The specific technique mentioned is T1001.003, which involves protocol or service impersonation, indicating that the attackers might be disguising their communication to avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used to transfer data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system. The mentioned technique, T1041, specifically refers to exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario of sending stolen data back to the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**: This tactic involves techniques used to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. While impact could be a goal of the attack, the question specifically mentions the sending of stolen data, which doesn't directly relate to disruption or manipulation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**: This tactic involves techniques used to execute malicious code on a compromised system. The scenario described focuses on the communication and data transfer rather than the execution of code.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This is a crucial part of the scenario, as the malware communicates with C2 domains. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs as the stolen data is sent, not the communication setup itself.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**: Given that the scenario specifically mentions sending stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure, this tactic directly aligns with the described action. The technique of exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041) supports this choice.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes the action of sending stolen data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system (C2 infrastructure).
   - The related TTPs highlight the use of C2 channels for communication and the specific technique of exfiltration over these channels.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurs as this data is being sent, which aligns with the definition of exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described points towards the exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: D
