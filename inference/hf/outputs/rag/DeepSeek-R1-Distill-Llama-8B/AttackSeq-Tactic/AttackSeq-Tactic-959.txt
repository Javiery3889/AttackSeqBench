Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next step in this cyber attack sequence. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols. I know that in cyber attacks, after compromising credentials, the next step often involves establishing a connection to a command and control server. The related TTPs provided include T1071, which is about application layer protocols, and T1095, which is for non-application layer protocols. 

So, the initial step is that the attacker has stolen credentials. That probably means they've already compromised some system, maybe through a phishing email or a breach. Once they have the credentials, they need to send them to their C2 server. The question mentions they used standard application layer protocols, so that would align with T1071.001, which specifically mentions web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.

Now, after sending the credentials, what comes next? Well, the next logical step would be to establish a command and control connection. The attacker would use the stolen credentials to access the system and then gain access to the network, possibly using other techniques. So the next tactic would be Command and Control, which is about establishing and maintaining unauthorized access. 

Looking at the answer choices, A is Initial Access, which I think refers to the initial compromise, like how they got in, maybe through a phishing email or a vulnerability. D is Credential Access, which is about obtaining the credentials, which has already happened. So the next step after sending the credentials would be to use them to take control, which is Command and Control. 

So the answer should be C: Command and Control.

The sequence starts with stealing credentials and sending them via application layer protocols. The next step is to use those credentials to establish command and control, which is the next logical step in the attack.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
