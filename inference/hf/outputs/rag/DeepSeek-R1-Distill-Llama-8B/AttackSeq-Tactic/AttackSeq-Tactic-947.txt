Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this cybersecurity question. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred when a backdoor started communicating with a specific URL. The scenario mentions that obfuscation methods were used for macro scripts to deliver a backdoor payload. The options are A: Defense Evasion, B: Command and Control, C: Privilege Escalation, D: Initial Access.

First, I need to recall what each of these tactics entails. 

Command and Control (C2) is about an attacker establishing a communication channel to receive commands and send data. This usually involves things like setting up domains or URLs for communication. So if the backdoor is sending commands over a URL, this seems related.

Defense Evasion is about avoiding detection, like using techniques to hide the attack. Obfuscation is a form of defense evasion, but the question is about what happened after the backdoor was delivered. So maybe not the main tactic here.

Privilege Escalation is about increasing access levels, like using a backdoor to gain higher permissions. That doesn't directly relate to communication after the backdoor is active.

Initial Access is about how the attack started, like how the attacker got into the system. But the question is about the communication after the backdoor is in place.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1071.001 is about using web protocols for C2, which fits with the URL communication. T1204 is about deobfuscating files, which was used in delivering the macro, but the question is about the communication after that.

So, the backdoor is communicating via a URL, which is a web protocol, so the tactic here is Command and Control.

The backdoor communicates via a URL, indicating Command and Control (C2) activity. The related TTP T1071.001 aligns with this, making B the correct answer.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
