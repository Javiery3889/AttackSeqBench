Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK tactic comes after Longhorn's malware communicates with their C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification. The options are A: Discovery, B: Exfiltrion, C: Lateral Movement, D: Command and Control.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The question is about the sequence of tactics in an attack. The initial action is that the malware communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS with a custom crypto protocol. So, the communication is secure, which suggests that the attackers are taking steps to protect their communications, making it harder to detect.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided. There's T1071.001, which is about using web protocols for C&C. That makes sense because HTTPS is a web protocol, so that's the method they're using. Then there's T1048.002, which is exfiltration over an asymmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol. Wait, but the question is about communication from the malware to C&C, not exfiltration. Exfiltration is usually data being sent from the target to the attacker, like stealing data.

So, after establishing a secure communication channel with the C&C, what comes next? Well, the C&C server is the command and control center. So the next step would be to establish command and control, which is tactic D. The attackers would then use this secure channel to send commands and receive data from the infected system.

Looking at the options, A is Discovery, which is more about gathering information about the target, like reconnaissance. That usually comes before the actual attack, so it's probably not the next step here. B is Exfiltration, which is about stealing data, but that's more of an action that could happen after establishing command and control, not necessarily the immediate next step. C is Lateral Movement, which is about moving through the network, like moving from one system to another within the same network. That could happen after establishing a presence, but the question is about communication method first.

So, putting it together, the sequence would be: establish secure communication (using HTTPS and custom crypto), then use that to gain command and control (C2). So the next tactic after establishing the C&C communication would be Command and Control.

The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware communicates securely with their C&C servers using HTTPS and a custom cryptographic protocol. The related TTPs include T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1048.002 (Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol). 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Discovery** is more about initial intelligence-gathering, which typically precedes the attack.
- **B: Exfiltration** involves data extraction, which can occur after establishing command and control but isn't the immediate next step.
- **C: Lateral Movement** involves moving within the network, which might follow initial access but isn't directly tied to the described communication method.
- **D: Command and Control** is the next logical step after establishing a secure communication channel with the C&C server.

Thus, the most plausible next tactic is Command and Control.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
