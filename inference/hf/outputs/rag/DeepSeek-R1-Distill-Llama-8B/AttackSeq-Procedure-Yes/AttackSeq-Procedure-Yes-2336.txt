Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a VBA macro in a phishing email would execute commands using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper from a Blogspot URL and then create a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that VBA macros can execute various commands when they're triggered, often through malicious scripts. The question mentions that the macro is auto-opened, which is a common phishing tactic. So the initial action is that the macro runs.

Now, the macro might execute 'mshta.exe', which is a legitimate Microsoft tool used for running HTML applications. Malware often uses it because it's a known and trusted executable, making it less likely to be detected. So, using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper makes sense as a way to fetch additional malicious code without raising too many flags.

The dropper, once downloaded, is a small executable that typically unpacks or injects malicious code into another process. Blogspot URLs are often used as C2 (command and control) servers because they can host various files and are relatively easy to set up. So, the dropper would connect to this URL to fetch more malicious code or instructions.

After the initial download, the malware would likely try to establish persistence. One common method is to create a scheduled task. Scheduled tasks in Windows allow programs to run at specific times, which is perfect for maintaining access or performing tasks without user interaction. The question mentions creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours. This would ensure that the malicious code continues to execute periodically, keeping the system compromised.

Looking at the related TTPs, the technique mentioned is T1059.005-Visual Basic. This technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting, which aligns with the use of VBA macros in this scenario. So, the sequence makes sense: the macro uses VBScript to execute 'mshta.exe', which then fetches a dropper from a Blogspot URL, and then sets up a scheduled task for persistence.

I don't see any immediate red flags or inconsistencies here. The steps are typical for an initial infection and persistence phase. The use of 'mshta.exe' is a known tactic, and using a Blogspot URL is a common C2 method. The scheduled task is a standard persistence mechanism. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, this sequence is likely.

The sequence described is consistent with known tactics used in cyberattacks. The VBA macro triggers 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper from a Blogspot URL, a common C2 method, and then creates a scheduled task for persistence. This aligns with TTPs involving Visual Basic scripting.

Final Answer: A: Yes
