Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information before communicating with its control servers using HTTP POST requests. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's about the Rising Sun implant's behavior during its download process. Specifically, after ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary into a startup folder, will it gather computer and user info before using HTTP POST to communicate.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three: T1071.001-Web Protocols, T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery, and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery. These all fall under the Discovery tactic.

T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control, which fits because the question mentions HTTP POST. T1016.001 is about discovering the internet connection, so maybe the implant needs to figure out how to connect online. T1033 is about discovering system owner or user information, which are the details we're interested in.

So, the Rising Sun implant probably first needs to know the system's details before it can communicate via HTTP POST. It would first gather the computer name and user info (T1033) and then establish a connection using web protocols (T1071.001). That makes sense because without knowing the system's details, it might not know how to communicate properly or where to send the data.

I think the answer is yes because the implant would need that information before making HTTP POST requests. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The Rising Sun implant likely gathers system information before communication. It uses T1033 to discover user and system details, then uses T1071.001 to send data via HTTP POST.

Final Answer: A: Yes
