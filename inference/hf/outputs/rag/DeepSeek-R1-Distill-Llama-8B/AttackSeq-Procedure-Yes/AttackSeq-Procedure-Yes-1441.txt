Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Taidoor malware will exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office after being delivered via spear-phishing emails. The question is asking if it drops itself onto the system before beaconing using HTTP GET requests. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Taidoor is a malware associated with APT29, which is a sophisticated group. They're known for using spear-phishing emails as an initial attack vector. So the initial step here is the spear-phishing email, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. T1566-Phishing is a broader category, while T1566.001 is more specific to using attachments. So the attack starts with sending a spear-phishing email with an attachment, which is likely the initial vector.

Now, the question is about whether the malware then exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office. I recall that many Office vulnerabilities are zero-day exploits that allow malicious code execution when a document is opened. So after the attachment is opened, the malware would exploit this vulnerability to drop its payload, which is Taidoor.

Once the payload is dropped, the next step is for the malware to establish communication, which is typically done via beaconing. Beaconing is a method where the malware sends data back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server. This is usually done using HTTP GET requests because it's a common method for establishing a connection over the internet.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: spear-phishing email (T1566.001) leading to the exploit of a Microsoft Office vulnerability, which drops the Taidoor malware. Then, the malware uses HTTP GET requests to beaconing. So the answer should be yes, it does drop itself before beaconing.

The sequence begins with a spear-phishing email (T1566.001) delivering an attachment. Upon opening, the attachment exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability, dropping the Taidoor malware. The malware then uses HTTP GET requests for beaconing.

Final Answer: A: Yes
