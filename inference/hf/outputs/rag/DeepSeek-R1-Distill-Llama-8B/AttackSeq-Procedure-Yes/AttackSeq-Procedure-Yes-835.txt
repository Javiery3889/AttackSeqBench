Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether WinDealer is likely to steal information from SNS applications and then encrypt it using AES before communicating with C2 servers via non-standard ports like 6999 or 55556. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1571 refers to using non-standard ports, which are ports not typically used by standard applications, so this could be a way to avoid detection. T1095 is about using non-application layer protocols, which might mean they're using something like HTTP or HTTPS but in a non-standard way, maybe over a different port or protocol.

Now, the question is about the sequence: stealing info, encrypting with AES, then communicating via non-standard ports. So, the steps would be: exfiltration (stealing data), encryption, and then communication.

Looking at the TTPs, T1095 is about non-application layer protocols, which could relate to how data is transmitted. If they're using a non-standard protocol, maybe they're using something like a custom protocol or a less common one, which could be why they're using non-standard ports. T1571 is about the ports themselves, so that fits with the communication part.

But wait, the encryption part is AES. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, commonly used for encrypting data. So, after stealing the data, they would encrypt it using AES. That makes sense as a standard step to protect the data during transmission.

So putting it together: Steal data from SNS (exfiltration), encrypt it with AES, then send it via non-standard ports. The TTPs T1095 and T1571 cover both the encryption (maybe T1095 is about the protocol used, which could be a non-standard one, and T1571 is about the port used for communication). So the sequence would involve using non-standard ports for communication after encryption.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, because the TTPs support both the encryption and the non-standard communication steps.

The analysis indicates that the sequence described aligns with the provided TTPs. WinDealer would exfiltrate data, encrypt it with AES, and then communicate via non-standard ports, which are covered by T1571 and T1095.

Final Answer: A
