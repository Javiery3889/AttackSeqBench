Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware would drop the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk, load it into the kernel, and then delete it to avoid detection after using wget to fetch malware samples via SSH access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. The scenario is that an attacker has obtained SSH access to a target system and used wget to download malware samples. Now, they're asking if Derusbi would then drop a kernel module, load it, and delete it to avoid detection.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1070.004 is about file deletion, and T1014 is related to rootkits. T1070.004 specifically mentions file deletion, which could involve removing logs or other files to cover tracks. T1014, the rootkit tactic, suggests the use of tools that hide the presence of malware by modifying the system's behavior or kernel.

So, the question is whether the attacker would use a kernel module like Turbo Linux Kernel Module (TLKM) to evade detection. Kernel modules can be a common way to hide malware because they operate at a lower level, making them harder to detect.

After obtaining SSH access, the attacker uses wget to fetch malware. Once the malware is on the disk, they might want to ensure it's not detected. Loading a kernel module could help in evading detection by hiding processes or activities. Then, deleting the module from the disk would prevent it from being found if someone checks the file system.

So, considering T1070.004, deleting the module would be part of covering their tracks. T1014, the rootkit, supports this by providing a method to hide the module's presence. Therefore, it makes sense that Derusbi would do this to avoid detection after loading the kernel module.

I think the answer is yes, because both T1070.004 and T1014 indicate actions that would involve deleting the module after loading it to avoid detection.

The attacker, having obtained SSH access and used wget to download malware, would likely employ a kernel module like TLKM. This module would be loaded to hide the malware, and then deleted using T1070.004 to avoid detection, supported by T1014's rootkit capabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
