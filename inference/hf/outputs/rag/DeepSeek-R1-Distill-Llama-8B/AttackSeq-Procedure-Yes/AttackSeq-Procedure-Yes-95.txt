Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server using webserv-redir.net for Command and Control after the given attack sequence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the attack starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document. I remember that CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office related to the way RTF files are processed. This exploit allows an attacker to execute malicious code, so the HTA file being dropped is likely the result of this exploit.

Next, the attacker uses WMI to check for installed antivirus software. WMI is a Windows Management Instrumentation, which can be used for various system checks. Checking for antivirus software is a common tactic to avoid detection, so this step is probably about defense evasion.

Then, the attacker executes the FinalBot backdoor using DLL sideloading. DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process. This is another evasion technique to avoid detection since the malicious code is loaded within a trusted process.

Now, considering the related TTPs provided: T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution. T1071.001 is about using web protocols for C2 communication, like HTTP or HTTPS. T1203 is about exploiting a vulnerability to execute malicious code, which aligns with the initial exploit using CVE-2017-11882.

Putting it together, the attacker is setting up a backdoor (FinalBot) and wants to communicate with it without being detected. Using web protocols for C2 makes sense because it's a common method and harder to detect. The HTA file, being dropped via the RTF exploit, is likely the delivery method for the backdoor. Since the backdoor is already in place, it's plausible that it would use a web protocol like webserv-redir.net for communication.

I don't see any steps that would prevent the HTA from using web protocols for C2. The WMI check is more about avoiding detection before execution, not about communication after. So, the answer should be yes, the HTA will communicate with the C2 server via web protocols.

The HTA file, delivered via the RTF exploit, is likely used to drop the FinalBot backdoor. Since the attacker is using web protocols for C2 (T1071.001), it's plausible that the HTA communicates with webserv-redir.net for command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
