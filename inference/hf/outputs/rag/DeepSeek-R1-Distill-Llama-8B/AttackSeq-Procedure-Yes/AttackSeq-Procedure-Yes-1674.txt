Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers would use the SocGholish framework through compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise and then use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Discovery with T1018-Remote System Discovery and Tactic: Initial Access with T1189-Drive-by Compromise.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. SocGholish is a framework used in attacks, often delivered via phishing emails or malicious links. It's known for initial access tactics, so T1189-Drive-by Compromise fits here because it's about compromising a system through a drive-by attack, like a malicious website.

After initial access, the next step would be to discover more systems. PowerView is a tool from the Mimikatz framework, used for credential dumping and enumerating systems. The Get-NetComputer command is part of PowerView and is used to gather information about the network, which would help in lateral movement or further attacks.

So the sequence makes sense: first, the attacker uses a compromised website (Drive-by Compromise) to get initial access, then uses PowerView to discover more systems (Remote System Discovery). Therefore, the answer should be Yes, option A.

The attackers would likely use the compromised website for initial access (Drive-by Compromise) and then use PowerView's Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery.

Final Answer: A
