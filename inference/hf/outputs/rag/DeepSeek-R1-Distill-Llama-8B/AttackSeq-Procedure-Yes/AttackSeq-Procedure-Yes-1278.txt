Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper, after exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor and installing an MSI package, will drop a backdoor installer and use the BITSadmin command-line tool via UserInstall.exe before the backdoor achieves persistence by using an encrypted config file to connect to C&C servers. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. Tropic Trooper is a known malware, I think, so I should recall its behavior. From what I remember, Tropic Trooper is a backdoor that can be dropped by certain malware, maybe related to the Trickbot group. It's often used for persistence and control over a compromised system.

The question mentions that Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Equation Editor. I know that Equation Editor vulnerabilities, like CVE-2017-0043, allow attackers to execute malicious code. So, after exploiting this, the attacker can execute arbitrary code, which in this case is installing an MSI package. MSI packages are used for installing software, so this would be a way to deploy something on the compromised system.

Now, the question is about what happens next. The options are about whether the system will drop a backdoor installer and use BITSadmin with UserInstall.exe before the backdoor gets persistence through an encrypted config file.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs; Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution; Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs.

Wait, T1197 is about BITS jobs, which is the Background Intelligent Transfer Service. BITSadmin.exe is a tool used by BITS to manage and schedule file transfers. UserInstall.exe is a command-line tool that can be used to install software packages, which aligns with the MSI package being installed.

So, after the initial exploit, the attacker would likely use these tools to install the backdoor. The T1203 technique is about exploiting a client to execute something, which fits here because the attacker is using the Equation Editor to execute code, which then installs an MSI, which would be executed by UserInstall.exe.

Persistence is a key part of cyber attacks, so the attacker would want to ensure the backdoor remains active. The encrypted configuration file would store the C&C server details, so the backdoor can connect back to the attacker's server. But the question is about whether the backdoor is dropped and if BITSadmin is used before the persistence happens.

So, the sequence would be: exploit Equation Editor, install MSI via UserInstall.exe (which is part of the Execution phase), then drop a backdoor, and then set up persistence. The TTPs listed support this: using T1203 for execution, T1197 for using BITS to transfer or install files, and T1197 again for defense evasion, maybe to avoid detection.

Putting it all together, the answer should be Yes, the system will drop the backdoor installer and use BITSadmin with UserInstall.exe before the backdoor achieves persistence.

The analysis indicates that Tropic Trooper, after exploiting Equation Editor and installing an MSI package, would likely drop a backdoor installer and use BITSadmin with UserInstall.exe before establishing persistence. This aligns with the TTPs related to Execution, Persistence, and Defense Evasion techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
