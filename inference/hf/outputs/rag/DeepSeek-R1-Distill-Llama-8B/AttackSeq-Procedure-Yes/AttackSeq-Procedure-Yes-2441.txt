Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Elise's malware would communicate with a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about whether the malware, after collecting system information, communicates with a C2 server using an app-layer protocol. The related TTPs given are T1071.001-Web Protocols under Command and Control and T1016.001-System Network Configuration Discovery under the Discovery tactic.

I know that T1016.001 is about discovering network configurations, which includes things like gathering IP addresses, installed software, and process info. So Elise is doing that. Now, after gathering this info, the question is about communication with a C2 server.

T1071.001 is about using web protocols for C2. So, the malware might use HTTP or HTTPS, for example, to communicate with the server. That makes sense because web protocols are common for C2 communication.

So, putting it together, after discovering the necessary info, the malware would likely use a web protocol to connect to the C2. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The malware, after gathering system information, would use a web protocol like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the C2 server, aligning with T1071.001.

Final Answer: A: Yes
