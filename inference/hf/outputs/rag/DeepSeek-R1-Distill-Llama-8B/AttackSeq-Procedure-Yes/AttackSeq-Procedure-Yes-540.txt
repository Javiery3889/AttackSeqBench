Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the PIVY variant, which uses DLL sideloading to drop a DLL and modify its configuration to confuse tools, will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols like HTTP or DNS. The question is whether this is likely, and the options are Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the context. DLL sideloading is a common technique where malware loads a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. This can help bypass some defenses because the process appears legitimate. PIVY is using this method to drop a DLL and then modify its configuration, probably to make it harder for tools to parse the data correctly.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: T1071.001 is about using web protocols for C2 communication, and T1001.003 is about protocol or service impersonation. These both relate to how the malware communicates with its C2 servers.

DLL sideloading is often used in the initial stages of an attack, where the malware gains a foothold in the system. Once it's loaded, the next step might involve establishing communication channels. Since the question mentions modifying the DLL's configuration, it's possible that the malware is setting up a way to communicate over specific protocols.

T1071.001 specifically mentions using web protocols, which could be HTTP or HTTPS. T1001.003 could involve impersonating a legitimate service, maybe using DNS (like admin.nslookupdns[.]com) to hide C2 traffic by making it look like it's part of normal traffic.

So, putting this together, after evading initial defenses, the malware would likely establish a C2 connection using these techniques. Therefore, the answer is probably Yes.

The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading to evade defenses and modify configuration, suggesting it's setting up communication methods. The related TTPs indicate the use of web protocols and service impersonation, which align with establishing C2 communication. Thus, it's likely the malware will use these protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
