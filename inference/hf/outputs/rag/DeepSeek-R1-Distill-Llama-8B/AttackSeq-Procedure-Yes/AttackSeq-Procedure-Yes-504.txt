Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor used in the CostaRicto campaign would use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with C2 servers after performing process discovery and system information discovery during the discovery phase. The options are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1572-Protocol Tunneling and T1071.004-DNS.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1572-Protocol Tunneling refers to the use of a tunneling technique to hide communication, often over a protocol like HTTP or HTTPS, to avoid detection. T1071.004-DNS is about using DNS for tunneling, which is a method where DNS queries are used to establish a tunnel, often for command and control (C2) communication.

The question is about whether the backdoor would use these techniques after the discovery phase. During the discovery phase, the attacker would gather information about the target system, like identifying active services, user accounts, and other details. Once they have this info, they might look for ways to establish a persistent backdoor for future access.

SombRAT is known for using process discovery and system information discovery, so it's likely they'd use some form of communication method that's stealthy. Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP makes sense because it can bypass some firewalls and network monitoring tools that might block other methods like direct TCP/IP connections.

DNS tunneling (T1071.004) is a common technique for establishing a C2 channel because DNS is a common protocol that's often allowed and less likely to be blocked. Similarly, using HTTP tunneling (T1572) would allow the backdoor to communicate over a port that's typically open, making it harder to detect.

Putting it together, after discovering the system, the attacker would likely establish a tunnel using DNS and HTTP to maintain persistence and communicate with their C2 servers without being easily noticed. So the answer should be Yes.

The SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information gathering, would likely use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control channel, as these methods are stealthy and effective for evading detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
