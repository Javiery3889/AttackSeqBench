Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor communicates with a C&C server via HTTPS after being executed through a remote code execution vulnerability. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attacker exploited a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing application for Initial Access. That makes sense because remote code execution is a common initial step to gain access to a system. Then, they used cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor for Execution. I know that SparrowDoor is a known malware that's used for persistent access, often used by APT groups like APT29.

Now, the main question is about communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server. The related TTPs provided are T1071.001-Web Protocols under Command and Control and T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application under Initial Access. 

T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for C&C, which could include HTTPS. Since HTTPS is a secure method, it's common for malicious actors to use it to avoid detection. On the other hand, T1190 is about exploiting public-facing applications, which is exactly what happened in the initial access phase.

I'm thinking that after gaining access, the malware would want to communicate securely. Using HTTPS makes sense because it's encrypted and harder to block compared to plaintext protocols. So, it's likely that SparrowDoor would use HTTPS for its C&C communication. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The attacker exploited a remote code execution vulnerability (T1190) to gain initial access and executed SparrowDoor. SparrowDoor, known for its persistence, would likely use a secure protocol like HTTPS (T1071.001) for Command and Control to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
