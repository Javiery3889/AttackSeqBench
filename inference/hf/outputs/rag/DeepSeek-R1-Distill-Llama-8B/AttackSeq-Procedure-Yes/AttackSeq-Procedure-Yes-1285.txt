Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking in the Defense Evasion phase. They used a benign file, wab32res.dll, to load a malicious wab32res.dll. DLL hijacking is a common technique where malicious DLLs replace legitimate ones, allowing attackers to execute code without being detected easily.

Now, the question is about the next phase, Command and Control (C&C). The options are whether they'll use SSL. I remember that SSL is used for encrypting communications, making it harder to intercept. But I'm not sure if Tropic Trooper specifically uses SSL in their C&C.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two techniques mentioned: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading and T1218.011-Rundll32. T1574.002 involves using a benign file to load a malicious DLL, which is exactly what happened here. T1218.011 is about using Rundll32.exe to execute malicious code.

I don't see any direct mention of SSL in the related TTPs. So, I'm thinking that while SSL is a common practice for C&C to avoid detection, the question is whether TClient will use it based on the given context. Since the question doesn't specify that Tropic Trooper uses SSL, I can't assume that. The focus here is on the DLL hijacking technique used, not on SSL encryption.

Therefore, without explicit information about SSL usage in the related TTPs, it's safer to say that it's not necessarily likely that they'll use SSL. So the answer is No.

The question focuses on whether TClient will use SSL during the C&C phase after using DLL hijacking. The related TTPs mention techniques related to DLL loading but don't specify SSL usage. Without explicit mention of SSL, it's not certain they'll use it.

Final Answer: B: No
