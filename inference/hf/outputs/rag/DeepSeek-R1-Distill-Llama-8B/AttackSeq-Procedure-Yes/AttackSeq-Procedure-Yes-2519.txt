Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access before moving on to exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTP is Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking if the campaign used an initial exploit (CVE-2020-35730) on Roundcube mail servers to gain access, and then used another vulnerability in Roundcube for further discovery. So, the sequence is two steps: initial access via exploit, then discovery using another vulnerability.

Looking at the related TTP, it's about Initial Access using T1190, which is Exploit Public-Facing Application. That makes sense because exploiting a public-facing application is a common initial access method. The specific CVE mentioned is 2020-35730, which I should check what it is. I recall that CVE-2020-35730 relates to a vulnerability in Roundcube, possibly related to remote code execution or authentication issues. So, the first step is using this exploit to get in.

After initial access, the next step is exploiting another vulnerability in Roundcube for discovery. So, the campaign would first use the initial exploit to get a foothold, then use another vulnerability to gather more information. This makes sense as a typical attack sequence: initial access followed by expansion or discovery.

I don't see any conflicting information in the related TTPs that would suggest this isn't the case. The TTP provided directly relates to initial access, so the answer should be Yes.

The BlueDelta campaign likely used the initial access exploit (CVE-2020-35730) on the Roundcube mail servers, followed by exploiting another vulnerability in Roundcube for discovery activities. This aligns with a typical attack sequence of initial access followed by expansion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
