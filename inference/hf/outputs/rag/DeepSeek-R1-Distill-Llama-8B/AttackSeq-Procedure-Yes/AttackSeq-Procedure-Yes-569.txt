Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware would save screen recording files in a specific format during the data collection phase after it collects system information and Bitcoin wallet addresses. The question gives me two related TTPs: T1125-Video Capture and T1113-Screen Capture, both under the Collection tactic.

First, I need to understand what each of these TTPs entails. T1113-Screen Capture refers to the malware taking screenshots of the user's screen, which is a common method for collecting information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. T1125-Video Capture, on the other hand, involves recording video, which can capture more dynamic activities, such as keystrokes, mouse movements, and other interactive actions.

The question is about whether the malware would save these files in the format [%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi. This format suggests a timestamped video file, which aligns with both T1113 and T1125 since both involve capturing visual data over time.

Now, considering the attack sequence: the malware first collects basic system information and then searches for Bitcoin wallet addresses. After that, it's likely to continue its data collection by capturing more detailed information. Screen capture makes sense here because it can reveal more sensitive data beyond just system info and wallet addresses, such as login credentials or payment information.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Since both TTPs are related to video or screen capture, and the format specified matches what these TTPs would produce, it's logical that the malware would use one or both of these techniques. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The malware is likely to save screen recording files in the specified format because both T1113 and T1125 involve capturing visual data, which aligns with the given format.

Final Answer: A
