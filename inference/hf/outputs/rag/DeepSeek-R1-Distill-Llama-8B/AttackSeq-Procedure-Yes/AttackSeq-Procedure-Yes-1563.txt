Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol after being delivered through a supply chain attack. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Sunburst backdoor was used in the SolarWinds attack, which was a supply chain attack. So the initial access was through compromising SolarWinds software, which is a legitimate tool used by IT and DevOps teams. That's where the T1195.002 comes in, which is about compromising the software supply chain.

Now, once the attackers have initial access, they would need to establish communication with their command and control (C2) servers. The question is about the protocol they'd use for this communication. The related TTP mentioned is T1071.001-Web Protocols. I remember that T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for C2 communication, like HTTP or HTTPS.

So, considering that the backdoor was delivered through a supply chain, it's likely that the attackers would use a web-based protocol because it's common and widely used. Web protocols are versatile and can be difficult to block if not properly monitored. They can also be encrypted, making them harder to detect.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Since the related TTP is about web protocols, it makes sense that the backdoor would use one. So the answer should be A.

The Sunburst backdoor, delivered via a supply chain attack, would likely use a web protocol for communication with its C2 server, as indicated by T1071.001. This aligns with common practices for initial C2 communication, making the answer A correct.

Final Answer: A
