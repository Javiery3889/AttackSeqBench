Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware is using application layer protocols to communicate with the C&C servers at the given IPs. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about whether the discovered system information, like hostname, user details, and active TCP connections, suggests that the malware is using application layer protocols to communicate with two specific C&C servers. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

I remember that T1071.001 refers to using web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for C&C communication. On the other hand, T1095 is about using non-application layer protocols, which I think are things like DNS or NTP, which aren't typically used for C&C because they don't carry the command and control data.

The question mentions that the system has hostname, user details, and active TCP connections. Hostname could be used for C&C communication if the malware is using a domain name to reach out. Active TCP connections might show the ports being used, which could indicate the protocol if we know the port numbers. For example, port 80 is HTTP, 443 is HTTPS, while others might be used for other protocols.

So, if the TCP connections are on ports 80 or 443, that would lean towards T1071.001. If they're on other ports like 53 (DNS) or 123 (NTP), that would be T1095. But the question doesn't specify the ports, just the IPs. So, without knowing the ports, it's a bit tricky.

However, the presence of hostname and user details might indicate that the malware is using a more structured communication method, which is typical for web-based protocols. Also, T1071.001 is a common tactic used in many attacks, so it's more likely than T1095.

Therefore, considering the related TTPs and the context, the answer is probably Yes.

The question asks whether the malware communicates with C&C servers using application layer protocols. The related TTPs are T1071.001 (web protocols like HTTP/HTTPS) and T1095 (non-application layer like DNS/NTP). Given the presence of hostname and TCP connections, if the ports are 80 or 443, it's more likely T1071.001. Since the question doesn't specify ports, but T1071 is more common, the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
