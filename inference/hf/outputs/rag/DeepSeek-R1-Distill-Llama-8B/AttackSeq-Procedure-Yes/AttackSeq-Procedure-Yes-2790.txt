Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app, after hiding its icon and running in the background on an iOS 7 device, will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the data via HTTP to the C2 server. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are Tactic: Exfiltration with Technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration, and Tactic: Discovery with Technique T1057-Process Discovery.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is about transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker's server, often automatically. T1057-Process Discovery involves identifying and listing processes running on the system, which helps the attacker gather information about what's running.

So, the question is about the sequence of actions the app takes. It hides its icon and runs in the background, which suggests it's trying to stay undetected. Then, it's likely to perform some discovery steps to gather information. Once it has that information, it would exfiltrate it.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the process discovery (T1057) would come before exfiltration (T1020). So the app would first gather the list of processes and then send that data out. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The XAgent app would first gather process information (T1057) before exfiltrating data (T1020), so the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
