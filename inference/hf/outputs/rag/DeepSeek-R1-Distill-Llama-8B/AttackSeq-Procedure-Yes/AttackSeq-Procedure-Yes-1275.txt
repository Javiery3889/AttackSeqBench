Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Yellow Garuda, after collecting data from Telegram, would exfiltrate it over the web and store it in SQLite and JSON. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question is about the likelihood of exfiltration. The tools mentioned are a Telegram 'grabber' that collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. So, the initial step is data collection. The related TTPs provided are T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1213-Data from Information Repositories.

Looking at T1041, this refers to exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel. That makes sense because once data is collected, it needs to be sent somewhere, and C2 channels are a common method for that. So, the data would be transmitted via a C2, which could be over the web, like HTTP or HTTPS.

Then, T1213 is about data from information repositories. This could mean that the data is stored in a database, which aligns with the question's mention of SQLite and JSON. SQLite is a common database format, and JSON is a data interchange format. So, the data would be stored in a structured way, which fits with T1213.

Putting it together, the sequence would be: collect data, then exfiltrate it over a C2 channel, and then store it in a database and JSON format. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The question asks if data collected from Telegram is exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite and JSON. The TTPs provided are T1041 (exfiltration over C2) and T1213 (data from repositories). Since T1041 involves sending data via C2, which is typically over the web, and T1213 involves storing data in a structured format like SQLite and JSON, the sequence makes sense. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
