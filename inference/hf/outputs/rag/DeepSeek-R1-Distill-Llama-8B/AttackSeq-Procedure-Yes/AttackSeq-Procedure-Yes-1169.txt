Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS. The question is asking if this setup is likely. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs provided are T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, both under the Exfiltration tactic.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1029-Scheduled Transfer refers to exfiltration where data is transferred at specific times, maybe to avoid being noticed. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware uses a command and control (C2) channel to send data out, perhaps using encrypted communication to evade detection.

The scenario mentions using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS. HTTPS is a secure protocol, so using a custom one might make it harder to detect because it's not standard. The domain and IP are configured per target, which could help in avoiding detection by upload limits and randomized intervals. So, the idea is that by staggering the exfiltration times and using a custom HTTPS, the malware can send data without being easily detected.

Looking at the TTPs, both relate to exfiltration methods. T1029 is about scheduling the transfer, which fits with the idea of avoiding detection by timing. T1041 is about using a C2 channel, which aligns with the use of a custom protocol for communication, possibly to encrypt and hide the data.

So, putting it together, using a custom HTTPS setup with scheduled exfiltration over a C2 channel would allow the malware to send data without being easily detected by upload limits or random intervals. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The scenario describes a setup where Longhorn's malware uses a custom HTTPS protocol with scheduled exfiltration over a C2 channel. The TTPs T1029 and T1041 support this by indicating exfiltration through scheduled transfers and C2 communication, respectively. This combination would allow the malware to avoid detection by evading upload limits and using randomized intervals, making the answer Yes.

Final Answer: A
