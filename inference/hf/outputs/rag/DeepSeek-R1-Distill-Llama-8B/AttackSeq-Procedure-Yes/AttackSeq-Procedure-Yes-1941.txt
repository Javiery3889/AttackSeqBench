Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Smooth Operator malware will exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after establishing communication with its C2 servers using HTTPS and a custom encoding algorithm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the question is about the likelihood of the malware exfiltrating data using HTTP GET after setting up communication over HTTPS with a custom encoding method. The related TTPs provided are T1071.001-Web Protocols under Command and Control and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel under Exfiltration.

Let me start by understanding each TTP. T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control. This could mean that the malware uses HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with its C2 servers. Since the question mentions HTTPS, that fits with T1071.001 because HTTPS is a web protocol.

Next, T1041 is about exfiltration over a C2 channel. This suggests that once the malware has established communication with the C2, it can send data back to the attacker. Now, the question is whether this exfiltration happens via HTTP GET.

HTTP GET is a method used to retrieve data from a server. In the context of exfiltration, the malware would send a GET request to the C2 server to send back the stolen data. However, since the initial communication is over HTTPS, which is a secure protocol, I'm a bit confused because HTTPS is typically used for secure communication, not for sending data that's meant to be exfiltrated.

Wait, but maybe the custom encoding algorithm is used to obfuscate the data before sending it. So the data is encoded, then sent over HTTPS. But the question is about the method of exfiltration. If the data is being sent via HTTP GET, that's a standard method, but since HTTPS is already in use, perhaps the exfiltration would also use HTTPS. However, the T1041 TTP specifically mentions exfiltration over the C2 channel, which might imply the use of a specific protocol like HTTP or HTTPS.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether it's likely that the malware uses HTTP GET for exfiltration. The related TTPs include both T1071.001 (web protocols) and T1041 (exfiltration over C2). So the malware would first use a web protocol to communicate with C2, then use that same or another protocol to exfiltrate data.

Wait, but T1041 is about exfiltration over the C2 channel, which is a specific tactic. So the exfiltration method would be over the same C2 channel, which is already established using HTTPS. Therefore, the exfiltration would likely use HTTPS as well, not HTTP. But the question is about HTTP GET specifically.

Alternatively, maybe the exfiltration uses HTTP GET because it's a common method, but since the initial communication is HTTPS, perhaps the exfiltration is done via HTTPS as well. However, the T1041 TTP doesn't specify the protocol, just that it's over the C2 channel. So the method could be either HTTP or HTTPS.

But the question is whether it's "likely" to use HTTP GET. Given that the initial communication is HTTPS, it's possible that the exfiltration would also use HTTPS, but the T1041 TTP doesn't specify the protocol. However, the T1071.001 TTP is about web protocols, which include both HTTP and HTTPS. So the malware could use either, but the question is about HTTP GET specifically.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's likely to use HTTP GET. The T1041 TTP is about exfiltration over the C2 channel, which is the same as the command and control. So the method of exfiltration would be via the same channel, which is HTTPS in this case. Therefore, the exfiltration would use HTTPS, not HTTP. So the answer would be no, it's not likely to use HTTP GET.

Alternatively, maybe the exfiltration uses HTTP GET regardless of the initial protocol. But the T1041 TTP doesn't specify the protocol, just that it's over the C2 channel. So the method could be either, but the question is about HTTP GET specifically.

Wait, but the initial communication is over HTTPS, so the exfiltration would likely use HTTPS as well. Therefore, the answer would be no, it's not likely to use HTTP GET. So the answer is B: No.
</think>

The malware uses HTTPS for initial communication, and the exfiltration would likely follow the same secure protocol, making the use of HTTP GET for exfiltration unlikely.

Final Answer: B: No
