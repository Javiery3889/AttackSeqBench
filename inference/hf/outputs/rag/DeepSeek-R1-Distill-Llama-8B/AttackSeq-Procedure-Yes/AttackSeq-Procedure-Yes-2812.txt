Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and sends HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp after gathering system information. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the question is about the behavior of the Derusbi malware. The scenario says that after gathering system information and beacons, it sends this data to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via port 443. The question is whether it then uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscation and sends POST requests to a specific URL.

Looking at the related TTPs, the only one mentioned is T1071.001-Web Protocols. I remember that T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for C2 communication. This could include HTTP or HTTPS. Obfuscation techniques are often used to hide the true nature of the traffic, making it less likely to be detected.

So, the malware is already using port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS. That makes sense because it's a common port for encrypted traffic. Now, the question is about HTTP beaconing, which I think refers to sending data over HTTP, possibly in a more covert way. Obfuscation would make the packets appear as something else, like regular traffic, which helps avoid detection.

The specific URL mentioned is /photos/photo.asp. I'm not sure why this particular URL is used, but it's possible that it's a common part of some web applications, making it a good hiding spot for C2 traffic. POST requests are often used in web applications to send data, so using this method could help blend in with normal traffic.

Putting it all together, since the malware is already using a web protocol (HTTPS via port 443), it's plausible that it would use HTTP beaconing with obfuscation for its C2 communications. This would make the traffic look like regular web traffic, making it harder to detect. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The Derusbi malware uses web protocols for C2 communication, specifically HTTPS via port 443. Given that it's already employing a web-based method, it's plausible that it would use HTTP beaconing with obfuscation, such as sending POST requests to a URL like /photos/photo.asp, to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
