Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke malware would search removable drives for files after targeting files on hard drives and network drives. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CosmicDuke is a malware associated with APT29, which is a group known for targeted attacks, especially against organizations, often for espionage. They're known for using various tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The question is about whether, after CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives, it would also search removable media like USB drives. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Collection with T1025-Data from Removable Media and Tactic: Discovery with T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery.

I remember that T1025 refers to the use of removable media to gather data. So, if the malware is already collecting data from hard drives and network drives, it's possible it would also use removable media as another method. T1120 is about discovering peripheral devices, which would include things like USB drives.

So, the attack sequence would likely involve first discovering all possible storage devices (T1120), and then using those to collect data (T1025). Therefore, after targeting the initial locations, the malware would probably check for and use removable media to gather more data.

The malware, after targeting fixed and network drives, would likely employ T1025 to collect data from removable media, which is part of the Collection tactic. This aligns with the related TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
