Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'stopedge.bat' script would delete the 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' files after the 'versioninfo.bat' script collects information for exfiltration. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The 'versioninfo.bat' script is used to gather system details, which are then exfiltrated. After this happens, the 'stopedge.bat' script is supposed to delete these files to avoid detection. 

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two main ones: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell and T1070.004-File Deletion. T1059.003 is about using a command shell, which makes sense because both scripts are .bat files, so they're executed via the command line. That means both scripts would run in a command shell, which fits this technique.

Now, T1070.004 is about file deletion. The question is whether 'stopedge.bat' would delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'. Since the 'versioninfo.bat' has already been used for exfiltration, it's logical that the attacker would want to clean up by deleting it. Also, 'update.vbs' might be another file that's no longer needed or could be suspicious, so deleting it would help in evading detection.

I don't see any conflicting TTPs here. The 'stopedge.bat' script's purpose seems to align with both the execution tactic and file deletion tactic. So, it's plausible that this script would handle the deletion.

The 'stopedge.bat' script is designed to delete files after 'versioninfo.bat' has exfiltrated data. Both scripts use a command shell, aligning with T1059.003, and 'stopedge.bat' deletes files, fitting T1070.004. Thus, it's likely that 'stopedge.bat' deletes the files.

Final Answer: A: Yes
