Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28's malicious document using DDE via PowerShell would create a batch file and a registry entry for persistence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT28 is associated with advanced persistent threats, so they probably use techniques to ensure their malware stays on the system after initial execution. The question mentions they're using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) with PowerShell. I remember that DDE can be used to execute commands by leveraging existing processes, which can help in evading some detection.

Looking at the related TTPs, there's T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange, which is exactly what's being used here. This technique allows the document to execute commands dynamically, which is how the malicious code is being run. So the initial step is the DDE execution via PowerShell.

Now, the question is about persistence. The related TTPs also include T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. This suggests that the attackers might be using registry entries or startup folders to ensure the malware runs on boot-up. But does DDE typically create a batch file and registry entries for persistence?

I think that some APTs do create batch files as part of their persistence. For example, a batch file might be used to execute a malicious script at system startup. Additionally, registry entries can be added to run certain programs at login or system boot. So, using both a batch file and registry entries would make sense for persistence.

Wait, but does DDE always lead to that? Or is it possible that the DDE itself is enough for persistence? I recall that while DDE can execute commands, it's more of a delivery method rather than a persistence mechanism. So, to ensure the malware stays on the system, they might create additional persistence mechanisms like batch files or registry entries.

So, putting it together, after using DDE to execute the malicious code, the attackers would likely create a batch file to run on startup and add a registry entry to make sure it runs every time the system boots. That would fit with the TTPs provided.

The malicious document uses DDE via PowerShell to execute commands, which is a delivery method. To ensure persistence, it's plausible that the attackers would create a batch file and a registry entry. These would allow the malware to run at system startup, aligning with the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
