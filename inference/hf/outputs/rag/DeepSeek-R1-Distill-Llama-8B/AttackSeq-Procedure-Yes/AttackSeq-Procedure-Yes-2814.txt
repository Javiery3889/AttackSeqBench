Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Derusbi would gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server after using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table to evade detection. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1082-System Information Discovery and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol under the Command and Control tactic.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1082 is about discovering system information, which could involve gathering things like hostname, IP addresses, or other system details. T1095 is about communication that doesn't use the application layer, so maybe using sockets or other low-level methods.

The question is about the attack sequence. Derusbi uses a LKM to modify the system's global call table. I think a LKM is a Loadable Kernel Module, which can manipulate the kernel to hide or alter system behavior. Modifying the global call table might be a way to intercept or alter how system calls are handled, possibly to avoid detection.

So, after evading detection by modifying the call table, would Derusbi then gather system info? Well, to communicate with the C2 server, it needs some information about the victim's network setup. Maybe it needs to know the IP addresses or other network details. So, using T1082 makes sense here because it's about gathering that system information.

Then, once it has the necessary info, it would use T1095 to communicate via a non-application layer protocol, like a raw socket, which is lower level than typical HTTP or HTTPS. This would help avoid detection since it's not using the usual ports or protocols that are monitored more closely.

So putting it together, the sequence would be: first, gather system info (T1082), then use a non-application protocol (T1095) to communicate with C2. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, option A.

The attack sequence begins with Derusbi using a LKM to modify the system's call table to evade detection. This modification likely helps in avoiding traditional detection methods. Next, to establish communication with the C2 server, Derusbi would need system information, such as network details, which aligns with T1082. Once this information is gathered, it would use a non-application layer protocol (T1095) to communicate securely, avoiding detection through standard monitoring. Thus, the sequence involves both T1082 and T1095, making the answer:

Final Answer: A
