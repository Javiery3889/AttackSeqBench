Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and try to download the full RAT component from the given IP address before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. The initial access was through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which drops a downloader file.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence. The RTF document exploit (CVE-2012-0158) is a known vulnerability that allows remote code execution. So, the malware is dropped onto the victim's machine. Now, the question is about what happens next.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are three: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, T1059.007-JavaScript, and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer. 

T1203 is about exploiting a client to execute something, which fits because the RTF exploit is delivering malicious code. T1059.007 is JavaScript, which might be used for persistence or further execution steps. T1105 is about transferring tools, which could mean the malware is trying to download more components or establish communication.

The question is whether the malware will execute on the machine and then try to download the RAT. So, after the initial drop, the malware would execute, likely using T1203 to run some code. Then, it might use JavaScript (T1059.007) to establish persistence or download additional files. Once the RAT component is downloaded, it would attempt to connect to the C2 server using a custom TCP protocol, which is part of the Command and Control tactic (T1105).

Putting it together, the sequence would be: exploit drops, executes, uses JS for further actions, then transfers the RAT and establishes C2. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The malware, after exploiting the RTF document, would execute on the victim's machine. It would use JavaScript to facilitate further actions, including downloading the RAT component. Once the RAT is downloaded, it would attempt to connect to the specified server using a custom TCP protocol to establish command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
