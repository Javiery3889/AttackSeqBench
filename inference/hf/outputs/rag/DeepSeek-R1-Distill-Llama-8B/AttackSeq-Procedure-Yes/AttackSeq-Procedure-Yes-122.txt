Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius would use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. The question is based on them exploiting public-facing applications via CVE-2018-13379. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are Tactic: Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and Tactic: Lateral Movement (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol).

First, I need to understand the context. Agrius is an APT group known for targeting various industries, including healthcare, financial services, and government sectors. They often use initial access tactics like exploiting public-facing applications, which makes sense here since they used CVE-2018-13379. This exploit is related to Apache Struts, which is a common web application vulnerability. So, initial access is confirmed.

After gaining access, what do they do next? The question is about their next steps. The related TTPs mention lateral movement using T1021.001, which is about using RDP for movement. So, they might use RDP to move laterally within the network. But the question also asks if they use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic. Webshells are malicious scripts that can be used for various purposes, including tunneling, credential dumping, or lateral movement.

I recall that webshells can be used to establish persistent access or to move laterally. So, if they're using RDP for movement, they might use a webshell to create a tunnel over RDP to avoid detection. This would help in moving between systems without being noticed as easily.

Additionally, the question mentions leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement. Compromised accounts could be used to access other systems or to create new ones, which aligns with T1021.001. So, using RDP with webshells would make sense as a way to move laterally using these accounts.

Furthermore, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP is another method for communication. Webshells can be used to establish such backdoors, providing a way to exfiltrate data or receive commands. This would allow Agrius to communicate with their C2 servers without being easily detected.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: exploit public-facing app (CVE-2018-13379) for initial access, then use webshells for RDP tunneling and lateral movement using compromised accounts, and then use the IPsec Helper backdoor over HTTP to communicate with their C2. This fits the TTPs provided and is a common tactic for APT groups like Agrius.

The analysis indicates that Agrius would indeed use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers via the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. This aligns with their known tactics and the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
