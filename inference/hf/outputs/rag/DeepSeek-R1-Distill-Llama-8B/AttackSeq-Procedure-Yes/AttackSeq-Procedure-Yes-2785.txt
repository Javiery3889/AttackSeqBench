Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malicious XAgent app will exfiltrate data via HTTP requests using a Base64 token. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking if, after collecting data like text messages, contact lists, and location info from iOS devices, the app will send this data to its C&C server using HTTP requests with a Base64 token for identification. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are T1132.001-Standard Encoding and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Looking at the TTPs, T1041 is about exfiltration over a C2 channel. That makes sense because the question mentions exfiltration. T1132.001 is about encoding, specifically Base64, which is used to hide data in HTTP traffic. So the app would encode the data before sending it.

So, the app collects the data, then uses a Base64 token to encode it, and sends it via HTTP to the C&C. That fits both TTPs mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.
</think>

The malicious XAgent app collects data and uses Base64 encoding to send it via HTTP to the C&C server, aligning with the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
