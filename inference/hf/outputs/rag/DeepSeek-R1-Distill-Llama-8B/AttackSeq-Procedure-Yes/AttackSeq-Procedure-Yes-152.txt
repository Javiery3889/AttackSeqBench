Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether PowerLess Backdoor, which uses 'Comsvcs.dll' to dump OS credentials, will target local user accounts for account discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that PowerLess Backdoor is a tool used for accessing systems, and it's using 'Comsvcs.dll' to dump credentials. From what I remember, Comsvcs.dll is a legitimate Windows component, often used by legitimate applications, but it can be misused by attackers to gather credentials. So, the first thing that happens is that the attacker gains access to credentials, probably local ones, through this DLL.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three: T1087.001-Local Account, T1003.001-LSASS Memory, and T1003-OS Credential Dumping. T1003.001 refers to LSASS memory dumping, which is a technique used to extract credentials from the LSASS process. T1003 is OS Credential Dumping, which is a broader category that includes various methods to get credentials, like mimikatz or other tools.

Now, the question is whether PowerLess Backdoor will target local user accounts for account discovery. So, after getting credentials, what does the attacker do next? Typically, after obtaining credentials, an attacker would want to discover more accounts, which could involve enumerating local users on the system. T1087.001-Local Account is exactly about discovering local user accounts, so that makes sense as a next step.

So, the sequence would be: using Comsvcs.dll to dump credentials (T1003), then using those credentials to access the system, and then enumerating local accounts (T1087.001). Alternatively, they might also use LSASS memory dumping (T1003.001) as another method to get credentials, but the primary focus here is on whether local accounts are targeted for discovery.

Putting it all together, the attack sequence would involve credential dumping using Comsvcs.dll, followed by using those credentials to access the system, and then enumerating local users. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely that PowerLess Backdoor will target local user accounts for account discovery.

The attack sequence begins with PowerLess Backdoor using 'Comsvcs.dll' to dump OS credentials (T1003). Once credentials are obtained, the attacker accesses the system and then enumerates local user accounts (T1087.001-Local Account). Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
