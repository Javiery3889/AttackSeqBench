Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after the initial access via the Sharpshooter downloader. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the initial access is through a malicious macro in Word. The Sharpshooter downloader is used to inject something into memory. So, the attacker has successfully compromised the system.

Now, looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1204.002-Malicious File and T1059.005-Visual Basic. T1204.002 is about executing malicious files, and T1059.005 is about using Visual Basic scripts.

I remember that T1204.002 is part of the Execution tactic, which involves running malicious code. So, if the attacker injects a malicious file, that's probably the first step. Then, T1059.005 suggests using Visual Basic, which is a common tool for persistence or further attacks.

So, after the initial injection, the attacker might use Visual Basic to download a second payload. That makes sense because Visual Basic can be used to execute commands, download files, or establish persistence. So, the Rising Sun implant could use this to get a second payload, which would then be used for more malicious activities.

Therefore, the answer is likely yes, the second-stage payload will be downloaded.

The Rising Sun implant is likely to download a second-stage payload using the Visual Basic technique after the initial access, making the answer A: Yes.

Final Answer: A
