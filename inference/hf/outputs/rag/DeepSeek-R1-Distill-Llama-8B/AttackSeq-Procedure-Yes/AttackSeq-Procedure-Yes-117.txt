Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius will deploy custom malware like the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor before achieving persistence by registering it as a service and deploying webshells. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Agrius has already exploited public-facing applications for initial access, which is the first step in many cyber attacks. After that, they've used RDP to upload webshells for lateral movement. Webshells are like small scripts that can be used to gain control over a system, so that makes sense as a next step for moving within the network.

Now, the question is whether they'll deploy custom malware next. The options are yes or no, and the related TTPs are about persistence techniques. The TTPs listed are T1505.003-Web Shell and T1543.003-Windows Service. T1505.003 is about using web shells, which they've already done. T1543.003 refers to creating a Windows service, which is a common persistence method because services can run at startup or remain hidden.

So, after initial access and lateral movement via webshells, the next logical step for persistence would be to create a service. Deploying a custom backdoor as a service would help in maintaining access. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is likely such a tool. So, yes, it's likely they'll do this before fully achieving persistence through the service registration.

I think the answer is A: Yes.

The attacker has already used webshells for lateral movement, so using a service for persistence makes sense. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service aligns with common persistence tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
