Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Gamaredon is a group known for their use of Outlook VBA macros to deliver malware. They send emails with malicious attachments, which are likely designed to trick users into opening them, giving the attackers initial access. So, the initial step here is T1566.001, Spearphishing Attachment, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.

Once they've gained access, the next step would be to move laterally within the network. They might use techniques like T1059.005, which is Visual Basic scripting, to execute malicious code. This makes sense because VBScript can be used for various tasks, including lateral movement.

Now, the question is whether they'll deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents. Looking at the related TTPs, there's T1119.001, which is Automated Collection. This tactic involves using tools that can automatically gather information without manual intervention. So, after moving laterally, it's logical that they'd use automated tools to collect data, including sensitive documents.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: Initial Access via Spearphishing, followed by Execution using VBScript for lateral movement, and then Automated Collection to gather sensitive data. So, the answer should be yes, they will deploy such scripts.

The sequence starts with Initial Access using Spearphishing (T1566.001), followed by Execution via VBScript (T1059.005), and then Automated Collection (T1119.001) to gather sensitive documents.

Final Answer: A: Yes
