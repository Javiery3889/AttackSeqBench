Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether LODEINFO malware will perform an HTTP POST after establishing a remote shell using a net use command. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that LODEINFO is a type of remote access trojan (RAT), which means it's designed to take control of a device and provide malicious actors with remote access. When a RAT is used, the attacker typically wants to establish a command and control (C2) channel to send commands and receive instructions.

The question mentions that the attacker used a "net use" command to confirm communication with the target device. The "net use" command is often used in Windows to map a network drive, which can also be used to establish a remote session. So, this step likely means the attacker has successfully connected to the target device, possibly using a RAT like LODEINFO.

Now, after establishing a remote shell, the next step would be for the malware to communicate back to its C2 server. Since LODEINFO is a RAT, it's designed to send information back to its command and control server. The related TTP mentioned is T1071.001-Web Protocols, which refers to the use of HTTP or HTTPS protocols for communication. So, it's likely that the malware would use an HTTP POST request to send data to the C2 server.

HTTP POST is a common method used in web applications for submitting data, so it makes sense that the malware would use this method to send commands or instructions received from the C2 server. The sequence would involve the malware sending a POST request containing the necessary data, which the C2 would then process and respond to, possibly with further instructions or data.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Based on the analysis, since the malware is a RAT and the TTP involves web protocols, it's highly probable that an HTTP POST would occur after establishing a remote shell. Therefore, the correct answer should be A: Yes.

The analysis indicates that LODEINFO malware, being a RAT, would use HTTP POST to communicate with its C2 server after establishing a remote shell. This aligns with the TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols, which involves web-based communication. Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
