Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about the Collection phase where PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives. Then, during Exfiltration, it's considering whether the malware will encode these archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks.

Looking at the Related TTPs provided, I see that the first two are under the Collection tactic. T1560-Archive Collected Data suggests that the malware is archiving the data it collects. T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method indicates that it's using a specific method to archive the data, which might be non-standard or unique.

The third TTP is T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits, which relates to exfiltration. This technique usually involves splitting data into smaller chunks to avoid detection or to fit within certain transfer limits, like email size restrictions.

So, during the Collection phase, the malware is compressing and archiving the files. Now, when it comes to exfiltration, the question is whether it will encode these archives with an unusual scheme and split them. The T1030 technique is about data transfer limits, which often involves splitting data into chunks. However, the initial TTPs mention archiving, which might already involve compression.

Wait, but the question is about encoding with an unusual scheme. The T1560s are about archiving, but they don't specify the type of encoding. So, maybe the malware uses a custom method for archiving, which could include encoding. If the encoding scheme is unusual, that's another layer. Then, splitting into chunks could be part of the exfiltration process to manage data size, which aligns with T1030.

So, considering that the malware is using a custom method for archiving (T1560.003), it's plausible that it would use an unusual encoding scheme as part of that process. Then, during exfiltration, it would split the data into chunks to transfer it, which fits with T1030.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, because the custom archiving method likely includes an unusual encoding, and the data transfer would require splitting into chunks to handle size limits.

The malware uses a custom archiving method (T1560.003) during collection, which may involve an unusual encoding scheme. During exfiltration, it splits the data into chunks to comply with transfer limits (T1030), making the encoding and splitting part of the exfiltration process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
