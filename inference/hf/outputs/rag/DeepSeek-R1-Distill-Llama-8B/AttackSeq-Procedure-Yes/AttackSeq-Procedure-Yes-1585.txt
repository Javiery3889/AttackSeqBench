Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether T9000 malware would use specific tactics after exploiting an RTF file. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question says that T9000 starts with an RTF file exploit, which triggers a multi-stage shellcode process. So, the initial attack is through a document exploiting a vulnerability, leading to the execution of malicious code.

Now, the options are about whether T9000 would then sideload a malicious DLL via a legitimate executable, specifically igfxtray.exe. Then, it would set registry keys and inject ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading. Both of these are under the Persistence tactic.

T1546.010 involves creating or modifying a legitimate executable to load a malicious DLL, which fits the idea of using igfxtray.exe as a vehicle. T1574.002 is about side-loading a DLL, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

So, the question is whether both of these steps would happen. Since both techniques are listed as related, it makes sense that T9000 would use both methods to ensure persistence. The first step is using a legitimate executable to load a malicious DLL, and the second is injecting another DLL into explorer.exe, which is a common way to maintain persistence.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, T9000 would use these methods.

The T9000 malware is likely to employ both T1546.010 and T1574.002 techniques, using legitimate executables to sideload malicious DLLs and inject into explorer.exe for persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
