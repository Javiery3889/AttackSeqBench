Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails. The question is asking if this is likely, given that Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform attackers about installed software during reconnaissance.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The attackers are using a technique where they send a GET request via Microsoft Word. I remember that OLE2 files, like those with .docm or .docx extensions, can contain embedded links or objects. Spear phishing typically involves tricking someone into opening such files, which can lead to malicious activities.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three techniques under Initial Access: T1566-Phishing, T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. T1566.002 specifically mentions embedded links, and T1566.001 refers to attachments. So, the attackers are using either embedded links or attachments in their phishing emails.

The question mentions that the attackers are using OLE2 format documents with embedded links. That aligns with T1566.002, which is about spearphishing links. So, the initial access is likely through this method.

I should also consider if the GET request from Microsoft Word is a red herring. Maybe the GET request is part of the attackers' reconnaissance to check if the software is installed. But the main point is how they gain initial access, which is through the OLE2 files with links, not the GET request itself.

So, putting it together, the attackers are using T1566.002 for their spearphishing campaign, which fits the scenario described. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The attackers are using OLE2 files with embedded links, which corresponds to T1566.002-Spearphishing Link. The GET request is part of their reconnaissance but doesn't directly grant access. The initial access is through the embedded links in the documents.

Final Answer: A: Yes
