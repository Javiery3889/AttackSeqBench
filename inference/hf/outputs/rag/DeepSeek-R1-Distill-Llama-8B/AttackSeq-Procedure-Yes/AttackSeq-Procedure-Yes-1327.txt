Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke would automatically upload collected data using FTP with stored credentials during the exfiltration phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CosmicDuke is a tool used by APT29, a group known for targeted attacks, especially against organizations like the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. They're known for their advanced tactics, so I should consider what they typically do.

The question mentions that during the Collection phase, they used a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. These tools are all about gathering information from the system. Keyloggers capture keystrokes, which could include login credentials. Screenshotters take screenshots, which might capture sensitive data like login pages or other sensitive information. Clipboard stealers capture whatever is copied to the clipboard, which could be credentials or other sensitive data.

So, after collecting this data, the next phase would be Exfiltration. The question is about how they handle this data. The related TTPs provided are:

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Let me analyze each of these.

T1020-Automated Exfiltration suggests that the attacker uses automated methods to transfer data. This could involve scripts or tools that send data without manual intervention. Since they've already collected data, automation makes sense here.

T1005 is about collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the collection phase described in the question. It's more about where the data is coming from, not how it's exfiltrated.

T1048.003 refers to exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols. FTP is a common example because it's unencrypted and doesn't use encryption, making it easier to intercept. If they're using FTP, this technique fits.

Putting it together, during exfiltration, CosmicDuke would likely use an automated method (T1020) to send the collected data. Since FTP is a possible method (T1048.003), they might use stored credentials to access remote servers. This makes the answer likely yes.
</think>

The question asks whether CosmicDuke would automatically upload collected data via FTP using stored credentials during exfiltration. Based on the analysis, the related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke uses automated exfiltration (T1020) and exfiltration over unencrypted protocols like FTP (T1048.003). Since they've collected data, using stored credentials to send it via FTP fits the tactics described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
