Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file with malware components. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the initial attack involves delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. So the user opens the document, which probably contains some malicious code. When they click on it, it triggers some actions.

The question is about the sequence of tactics and techniques used. The related TTPs given are T1059.001-PowerShell and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. 

T1059.001 is about using PowerShell, which makes sense because the script is a PowerShell file. So the first step is likely that the script uses PowerShell to execute some commands. 

Now, the 'fmx.ps1' script is supposed to decode the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'. Base64 decoding is a common way to hide malicious code in images or other files. So the script would take the image file, decode it, and execute the embedded script.

But wait, the question is whether this happens before the script downloads a zip file containing malware components. So the sequence would be: the initial document runs 'fmx.ps1', which then decodes 'sdmc.jpg' to get the next script, which then downloads the zip file. 

Alternatively, maybe the script uses PowerShell to download the zip file directly. But the key point is whether the decoding happens before the download. 

Looking at the TTPs, T1140 is about deobfuscating or decoding files. So the script would use a PowerShell command to decode the image, which would execute the embedded script. Then, that script might download the zip file containing the malware.

So the answer should be yes, because the script would first decode the image, execute the embedded script, which could then download the zip file with the malware components.
</think>

The 'fmx.ps1' script uses PowerShell (T1059.001) to decode the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' (T1140), which then executes and downloads the zip file containing the malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
