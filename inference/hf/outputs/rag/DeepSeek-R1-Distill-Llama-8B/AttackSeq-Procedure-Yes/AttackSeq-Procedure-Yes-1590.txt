Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether T9000 is likely to target Skype users, capture data from removable media, and exfiltrate it through compressed and encrypted network traffic. The question is whether this scenario is plausible, and the answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs provided are T1020, T1041, and T1560.003.

First, I need to understand each TTP. T1020 is about automated exfiltration, which means the attacker uses automated tools to transfer data out. T1041 is exfiltration over a C2 channel, so the data is sent through a command and control server. T1560.003 refers to archiving data using a custom method, which could involve hiding the data in files or other methods to avoid detection.

The question says that T9000 has evaded detection by customizing its installation. So it's probably using some sophisticated techniques to avoid being caught. Now, it's targeting Skype users. Skype is a communication tool, so maybe it's using it for command and control or exfiltration.

If T9000 is capturing data from removable media, that suggests it's using a method to access files on USBs or other removable drives. T1560.003 could be relevant here because it's about archiving data, perhaps by copying or hiding files on removable media. Once it has the data, it needs to exfiltrate it. T1020 and T1041 both relate to exfiltration. T1020 is about automated exfiltration, which would fit if the process is done without manual intervention. T1041 is specifically about using a C2 channel, which aligns with the idea of sending data to a server.

So putting it together, T9000 would first collect data from removable media using a custom method (T1560.003), then exfiltrate it automatically (T1020) over a C2 channel (T1041). This sequence makes sense because it's a multi-step process that's automated and avoids detection by using custom methods.

I don't see any conflicting TTPs here. All three are related to exfiltration and data collection, so the answer should be Yes.

The scenario describes a multi-step attack where T9000 uses T1560.003 to collect data from removable media, followed by T1020 and T1041 for automated exfiltration via a C2 channel. This sequence aligns with the question's description, making the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
