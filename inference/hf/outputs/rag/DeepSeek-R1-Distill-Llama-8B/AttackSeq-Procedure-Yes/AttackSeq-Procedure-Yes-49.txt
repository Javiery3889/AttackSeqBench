Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a malicious PowerShell script retrieved via a VBS macro from a phishing email will execute and download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial access is through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. Phishing emails often trick users into opening documents or clicking on links. In this case, the email has a Word document, and when the user opens it, they might be prompted to enable macros to view content or for other reasons. Enabling macros can be a common vector for delivering malicious code.

The malicious content is a PowerShell script encoded in a VBS file. VBS stands for Visual Basic Script, and it's a type of script file that can execute commands. The script is retrieved via a VBS macro. So, when the user enables macros, the VBS script runs. Now, I need to think about how this script would behave.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1204.002-Malicious File and T1059.001-PowerShell. T1204.002 refers to the use of malicious files, which could be the VBS script in this case. T1059.001 is about using PowerShell, which aligns with the fact that the script is being executed via a VBS macro, as VBS can call PowerShell.

So, the VBS script would likely execute PowerShell commands. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for various tasks, including downloading files or running malicious code. If the script is encoded, it might use Base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious code within a script.

Now, considering the payloads mentioned: Ursnif and GandCrab. Both are known malware families. Ursnif is a ransomware that encrypts files and demands payment, while GandCrab is also ransomware but might have different behaviors. These malware often spread through malicious scripts and can be downloaded using command-line tools in PowerShell.

Putting it all together: The phishing email leads to a VBS macro that executes a PowerShell script. This script could decode and execute malicious code, which would then download Ursnif or GandCrab. So, it's likely that the script would execute and download these payloads.

I don't see any immediate red flags that would prevent this from happening. The TTPs provided support this sequence: using malicious files (VBS) to execute PowerShell commands, which can then download the malware.

The phishing email leads to a VBS macro that executes a PowerShell script, which can then download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. The TTPs T1204.002 and T1059.001 support this sequence, indicating a likely successful attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
