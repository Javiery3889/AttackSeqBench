Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius will deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' sends recon info or downloads files. The question is asking if this is likely, and the options are Yes or No. The related TTPs given are T1485-Data Destruction and T1070.004-File Deletion under the tactics Impact and Defense Evasion respectively.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1485 is about data destruction, which fits with the idea of overwriting files, which is what 'DEADWOOD' does. T1070.004 is about file deletion, which could be a step before or part of the data destruction process. 

The scenario says that the 'IPsec Helper' is awaiting commands from C2 servers. So, once it receives commands, it might execute actions like sending recon info or downloading files. After that, it's likely that the attacker would want to erase data, so using 'DEADWOOD' makes sense for data destruction. 'Apostle' is a wiper, which is also used for data destruction, so it's plausible that both would be used together.

I think the sequence would be: after getting the data, the attacker would deploy these tools to overwrite files. So the answer should be Yes.

The question revolves around whether Agrius will deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' after the 'IPsec Helper' sends recon info or downloads files. The related TTPs are T1485 (Data Destruction) and T1070.004 (File Deletion), both relevant to data wiping. Since 'DEADWOOD' is a wiper and 'Apostle' is used for data destruction, it's logical that they would be deployed after data collection. Thus, the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
