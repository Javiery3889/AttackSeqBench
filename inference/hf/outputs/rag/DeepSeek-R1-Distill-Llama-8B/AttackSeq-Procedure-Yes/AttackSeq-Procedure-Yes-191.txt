Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Infamous Chisel, after collecting files, will exfiltrate them using Tor hidden services and SSH connections. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Infamous Chisel is a tool used for data collection. It collects files based on specific file extensions from application and data directories. So, the Collection phase is done using TTPs related to T1119, which is Automated Collection. That makes sense because T1119 involves tools like Mimikatz or Chisel, which are used to gather data.

Now, the question is about the Exfiltration phase. The options given are whether it uses Tor hidden services and SSH connections. Looking at the related TTPs, I see T1020 and T1041, both of which are exfiltration techniques. T1020 is Automated Exfiltration, which usually involves using tools like curl or wget to transfer data over HTTP or HTTPS. T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which typically uses encrypted communication channels like SSH or VPNs to transfer data securely.

Chisel itself is known for its ability to exfiltrate data using various methods. It can use different exfiltration methods, including Tor hidden services, which provide anonymity. SSH connections are also a common method for exfiltration because they're secure and can be encrypted.

So, considering that Chisel is used for both collection and exfiltration, and the related TTPs include methods that use Tor and SSH, it's likely that it would use these methods in the exfiltration phase. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The question asks whether Infamous Chisel, after collecting files, will exfiltrate them using Tor hidden services and SSH connections. 

1. **Collection Phase**: Infamous Chisel is used for automated collection (T1119), gathering files based on extensions.
2. **Exfiltration Phase**: The related TTPs include T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), which can use Tor and SSH.
3. **Conclusion**: Since Chisel can use these methods, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
