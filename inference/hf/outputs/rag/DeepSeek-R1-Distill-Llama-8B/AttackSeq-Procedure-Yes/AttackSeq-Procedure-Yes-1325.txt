Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating it via FTP after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. The scenario is during a discovery phase where someone is searching removable drives but skipping specific file types. The question is whether CosmicDuke, a known adversary, will then use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard and send it via FTP.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1025 is about data from removable media, and T1115 is clipboard data. Both are under the Collection tactic. So, the question is about the sequence of tactics and techniques used by CosmicDuke.

I know that CosmicDuke is a group associated with China, often involved in cyber espionage. They typically use various tactics like collection, exfiltration, and impact. They might use removable media to gather data because it's a common method for exfiltration, especially when direct network access is limited.

Now, the question is about whether they use a clipboard stealer after this. Clipboard data (T1115) is a common way to collect sensitive information because it's a temporary data source that might not be stored on the disk. So, if they're searching removable drives and find something, they might also look for opportunities to collect data from the clipboard, which could include credentials or other sensitive info.

FTP is a method they might use for exfiltration because it's a common protocol, though it's less secure than SFTP or HTTPS. So, the sequence would be: collect data from removable media, then use a clipboard stealer to gather additional data, and then exfiltrate that data via FTP.

Looking at the answer choices, A says yes, B says no. Since the related TTPs include both data from removable media and clipboard data, and considering CosmicDuke's methods, it makes sense that they would use both. So the answer should be A: Yes.

The question asks if CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after collecting data from removable media. Given that both T1025 and T1115 are related to data collection, and considering CosmicDuke's methods, it's plausible they would use a clipboard stealer to gather additional data before exfiltrating via FTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
