Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers using SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader during the Lateral Movement phase after using SharpHound and PowerSploit. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that TG1021 is a group known for using specific tools. They used SharpHound and PowerSploit here. SharpHound is a tool that's used for enumerating and accessing information from active directory and other network resources. PowerSploit is a payload delivery tool that can be used to load various malicious payloads, including web shells.

In the question, TG1021 has already used these tools during the Discovery phase. So, during the Discovery phase, they used these tools to gather information and output files. Now, moving into the Lateral Movement phase, the question is whether they would use SMB to access shared folders and drop a web shell.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer. T1021.002 refers to using SMB to access Windows admin shares, which is a common way to move laterally within a network. T1570 is about transferring tools using lateral movement techniques, which could include using web shells to transfer files or execute commands.

So, considering the group's tactics, after the initial phase of using SharpHound and PowerSploit, they would likely continue their lateral movement. Using SMB to access shared folders makes sense because it's a common network protocol and admin shares are often accessible with the right credentials. Once they have access to a machine, they can use a web shell like NodeIISWeb to maintain access or transfer more tools.

I think the answer is yes because both TTPs are part of the group's typical behavior. They would use SMB to move laterally and drop a web shell to maintain persistence or further their attack.

The analysis indicates that TG1021 would indeed access shared folders via SMB and drop a web shell during the Lateral Movement phase, aligning with their known TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
