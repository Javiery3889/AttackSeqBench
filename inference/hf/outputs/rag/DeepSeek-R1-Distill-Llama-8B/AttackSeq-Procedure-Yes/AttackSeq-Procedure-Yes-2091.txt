Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after using Cobalt Strike and administrative credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about whether, after using Cobalt Strike to map the network and collect admin-level credentials, attackers are likely to move laterally, compromising more workstations and internal hosts or servers.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1078.002 is about using domain accounts, which suggests that the attackers have access to high-privilege accounts within the domain. T1570 is about lateral tool transfer, which typically involves moving tools or malware between systems, often using legitimate or stolen credentials to spread across the network.

Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool used to map networks and gather intelligence. If an attacker uses this, they can identify the network structure and find potential entry points. Once they have administrative credentials, they can start moving laterally because they have higher privileges, making it easier to access more systems.

T1078.002, Domain Accounts, would allow attackers to access more resources by using domain admin accounts, which can span across different subnets and departments, facilitating lateral movement. T1570, Lateral Tool Transfer, would help them move tools or malware from one compromised system to another, possibly using these domain accounts to maintain access.

So, with both of these TTPs, it's highly likely that the attackers would move laterally to compromise more workstations and internal hosts or servers. They can use their domain access to move laterally, transfer tools, and escalate their access further.

The attackers are likely to move laterally because they have access to administrative credentials and can use domain accounts to transfer tools, facilitating widespread compromise.

Final Answer: A: Yes
