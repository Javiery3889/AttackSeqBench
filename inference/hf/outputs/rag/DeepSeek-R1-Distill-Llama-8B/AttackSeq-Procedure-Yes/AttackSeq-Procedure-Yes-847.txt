Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence points on new systems after the discovery phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the MITRE ATT&CK framework talks about the different tactics and techniques attackers use. The question is about the attack sequence after the discovery phase. During discovery, attackers gather info about the target's systems, users, and data. Once they have that, what's next?

I think the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network. Lateral movement is all about moving from one system to another within the same network, right? So maybe they'd use remote services to move around without installing persistence yet. Persistence is more about keeping access after they're done moving, like using cron jobs or something.

Looking at the related TTPs, there's T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services. That makes sense because exploiting remote services can help them access other systems without physical access. So, after gathering info, they'd probably use these remote services to move laterally, which would make sense before setting up persistence.

So, the answer should be yes, they would exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence points.

After gathering information during the discovery phase, attackers often use remote services to move laterally within the network, which aligns with the TTP T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services. This movement is typically before establishing persistence, as persistence is more about maintaining access post-movement.

Final Answer: A: Yes
