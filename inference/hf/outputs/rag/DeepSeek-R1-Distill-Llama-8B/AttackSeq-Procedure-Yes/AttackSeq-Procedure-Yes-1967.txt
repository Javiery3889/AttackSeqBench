Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally before accessing data from Information Repositories after using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to discover Active Directory info. The question is whether this is likely, and the options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. The StellarParticle campaign used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery. AdFind is a tool used for Active Directory enumeration, so the actor is probably gathering information about the network's AD structure. The custom PowerShell cmdlets might be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Now, looking at the related TTPs: T1482 is Domain Trust Discovery, which is part of the Discovery tactic. T1021.001 is Remote Desktop Protocol, which is a lateral movement technique using RDP.

So, the question is about whether the actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP. Privileged accounts have higher access, while non-privileged are lower. Using both would mean the actor might first use a non-privileged account to establish a foothold, then escalate using a privileged account to move laterally.

But wait, the initial step was using AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets. AdFind is typically used by domain admins or users with high privileges. So maybe the actor started with a privileged account to gather AD info. Then, after that, they might switch to RDP. But RDP can be used with both types of accounts. However, moving laterally using RDP with a non-privileged account might be less likely because they might not have the necessary access. Alternatively, they might use a non-privileged account to get initial access, then escalate to a privileged one to move laterally via RDP.

But the question is specifically about whether both types were used for RDP. So, if the actor used a privileged account for initial access via RDP, then maybe they used a non-privileged account later. Or vice versa. Alternatively, they might have used a non-privileged account to get into the network via RDP, then used a privileged account to move laterally.

Wait, but the initial activity was using AdFind and PowerShell, which suggests they had some level of access, possibly through a privileged account. So maybe they used a privileged account for the initial discovery, then used RDP with a non-privileged account to move laterally, but that might not be possible without some form of access. Alternatively, they might have used a non-privileged account to get into the network via RDP, then used that to gather AD info, then escalated to a privileged account to move laterally.

But the question is about whether both types were used for RDP. So, perhaps the actor used a non-privileged account to initiate RDP access, then after moving within the network, used a privileged account to access more resources, possibly via RDP again. Or maybe they used a privileged account for the initial RDP access and then used a non-privileged one for lateral movement. Either way, the key is that both types were used.

Alternatively, maybe the actor used a single account, but that's less likely because using both types is more common for better access.

So, considering the TTPs, T1482 is about domain trust discovery, which is part of the initial phase, and T1021.001 is RDP for lateral movement. The question is about whether both privileged and non-privileged accounts were used for RDP. Since the actor used AdFind, which is typically done by a privileged user, perhaps they used a privileged account for that, then used RDP with a non-privileged account to move laterally, or vice versa. Either way, the answer would be yes, they used both.

Wait, but the question is about whether they used both for RDP. So, if they used a privileged account to get into the network via RDP, then used a non-privileged account to move laterally via RDP again, that's possible. Or they might have used a non-privileged account to get in via RDP, then used a privileged account to move laterally via RDP. Either way, both types were used.

So, the answer would be A: Yes.
</think>

The threat actor likely used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally. They started with AdFind, which is typically done via a privileged account, then used RDP with a non-privileged account for lateral movement, or vice versa. Either way, both account types were employed.

Final Answer: A
