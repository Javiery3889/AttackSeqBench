Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware would use HTTP and HTTPS for command and control communication before exfiltrating documents. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Gamaredon is a group known for their activities in Eastern Europe, often targeting corporate environments. They're involved in things like supply chain attacks and stealing sensitive data. So, their malware is probably designed to gather information stealthily.

The question mentions that the malware searches for sensitive documents on local and network drives and captures screenshots every minute. That makes me think the malware is actively harvesting data over time, which suggests it's using some form of persistent access. Maybe it's using a backdoor or some kind of remote access tool.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: T1071.001-Web Protocols under the Command and Control tactic. T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for C2 communication. This could mean they're using HTTP or HTTPS to send commands or receive instructions. HTTP is unencrypted, while HTTPS is encrypted, so using both might indicate they're trying to balance between security and functionality.

Then there's T1020-Automated Exfiltration, which is about exfiltrating data. This could involve using web-based methods to transfer data out, maybe using the same protocols as the C2 communication.

So, putting this together, the malware would first use web protocols for command and control to receive instructions on what to do next. Once it has the data, it would then use the same or similar protocols to send the exfiltrated documents to the C&C server. This makes sense because using web protocols is a common way to communicate and transfer data over the internet, especially if they're trying to avoid detection by using encrypted HTTPS for some parts and HTTP for others, or maybe using different methods based on the environment.

I don't see any conflicting information here. The TTPs directly relate to both command and control and exfiltration using web protocols. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely they use HTTP and HTTPS for both C2 and exfiltration.

The analysis indicates that Gamaredon's malware would use HTTP and HTTPS for both command and control communication and exfiltration. The TTPs T1071.001 and T1020 support this, as they involve web protocols for C2 and data transfer, respectively.

Final Answer: A: Yes
