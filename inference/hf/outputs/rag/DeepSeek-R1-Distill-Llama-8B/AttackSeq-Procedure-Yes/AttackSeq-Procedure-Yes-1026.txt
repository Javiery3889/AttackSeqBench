Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware would scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. The question mentions that the malware inserted malicious macros into existing documents for persistence and used a backdoor to list interesting files, like Office documents during discovery. The related TTPs provided are T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive and T1083-File and Directory Discovery under the tactics Collection and Discovery, respectively.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1083, File and Directory Discovery, is about identifying files and directories on a system. This could involve scanning local drives to find specific files, maybe looking for certain types of documents or data. T1039, Data from Network Shared Drive, suggests that the adversary is accessing data from network shares, which might be part of exfiltration or data collection.

The question is whether the malware would scan all drives, including network ones, after using a backdoor. Since the TTPs mentioned are both under Collection, it makes sense that the malware is actively gathering data. The fact that they used a backdoor to list Office documents during discovery implies they're already inside the network, so they can access more resources.

I think the key here is that both T1039 and T1083 are about data collection. T1083 would help find files on the local system, and T1039 would allow accessing network shares. So, if the malware has a backdoor, it's likely they'd use it to collect data from various sources, including network drives. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely they'll scan all drives, including network shared ones.

The question asks whether Gamaredon's malware would scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data after using a backdoor. The related TTPs are T1039 (Data from Network Shared Drive) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery), both under the Collection tactic. 

1. **T1083** helps identify files and directories on the local system, which could include looking for specific files like Office documents.
2. **T1039** involves accessing data from network shared drives, which is part of data collection.

Since the malware has a backdoor, it can access both local and network resources. Therefore, it's plausible that it would use these TTPs to gather data from all available drives, including network shares.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
