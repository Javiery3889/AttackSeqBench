Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the WastedLocker ransomware, after being deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the defense evasion phase, will likely encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom in the impact phase. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact and T1489-Service Stop under the Impact tactic.

First, I need to understand the context. WastedLocker is a ransomware known for encrypting files on compromised systems and then demanding a ransom payment for decryption keys. The question is about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack.

The attack starts with deploying WastedLocker via PsExec. PsExec is a legitimate Windows tool used for executing commands, so using it for malicious purposes makes sense for initial access. The initial phase mentioned is defense evasion, which typically involves actions taken to avoid detection. Disabling Windows Defender (T1489-Service Stop) would prevent the antivirus from detecting the ransomware, which is a common tactic to ensure the attack isn't blocked early.

Now, after evading defense mechanisms, the next phase would logically be the impact phase. In this phase, the ransomware would start encrypting data. The related TTP here is T1486-Data Encrypted, which aligns with the typical behavior of ransomware to encrypt files to extort payment. Encrypting data would cause significant disruption to the organization, leading to downtime and financial loss, hence the demand for a multimillion-dollar ransom.

So, putting it together: the sequence starts with initial access via PsExec, then defense evasion by stopping services and disabling antivirus, and finally, in the impact phase, the encryption of data. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, leading to a significant disruption and ransom demand.

The sequence begins with the deployment of WastedLocker via PsExec for initial access. During the defense evasion phase, services are stopped and Windows Defender is disabled (T1489-Service Stop). This setup allows the ransomware to proceed to the impact phase, where it encrypts data (T1486-Data Encrypted), causing significant disruption and a multimillion-dollar ransom demand.

Final Answer: A: Yes
