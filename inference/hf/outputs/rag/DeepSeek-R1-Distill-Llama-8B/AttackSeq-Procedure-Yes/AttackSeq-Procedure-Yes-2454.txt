Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a banking Trojan would search for antivirus and banking software on a victim's system after using public cloud infrastructure to deliver malicious payloads. The question is part of a scenario where the Trojan is using public cloud infrastructure to deliver malicious payloads for evasion and creating registry keys in the Run folder for persistence. The options are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are Tactic: Discovery with T1518.001 and T1012.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1518.001 is about security software discovery, which probably means the attacker is looking for installed security software like antivirus programs. T1012 is querying the registry, which could be used to check for specific entries or configurations.

The question is about the discovery phase. After delivering malicious payloads, the Trojan would likely want to find out what's on the system. If it's looking for antivirus software, that makes sense because if an antivirus is present, it might interfere with the malicious activities. So, the Trojan would check if antivirus is installed. Also, checking the registry (T1012) could help in finding persistence mechanisms or other indicators of compromise.

So, the answer would be yes because the related TTPs involve checking for security software and registry entries, which would include antivirus and banking software.

The question asks whether a banking Trojan would search for antivirus and banking software during its discovery phase after using public cloud infrastructure. The related TTPs include T1518.001 (Security Software Discovery) and T1012 (Registry Query). T1518.001 suggests the attacker identifies security software, which would include antivirus programs. T1012 involves checking the registry, which could reveal banking software configurations. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
