Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether BlackEnergy 3, after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution, will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers. The question is whether this is likely. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1049-System Network Connections Discovery.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1018 is about discovering remote systems, which probably involves identifying other systems on the network. T1049 is about discovering network connections, so it's about finding how the systems are connected, maybe looking for open ports or services.

Now, the scenario is that the malicious code, BlackEnergy 3, has been installed via macro execution, which typically happens because an employee opened a malicious email attachment or clicked on a malicious link. Once installed, it's on the network. The question is whether it will then communicate with its C2 servers.

I think that after being installed, the implant would need to establish communication. So, the TTPs listed are about discovery, but how does that relate to communication? Maybe the discovery phase is part of the initial setup to find where the C2 is or to identify other targets.

Wait, but the question is about whether it will communicate. So, the TTPs mentioned are about discovering systems and network connections. If the implant uses these TTPs, it might be establishing a connection to the C2. So, perhaps after discovery, it can find the C2 server and then communicate.

Alternatively, maybe the TTPs are part of the initial phase before communication. So, the implant uses these discovery techniques to find the C2's location, and then establishes the connection. So, the answer would be yes, because after discovery, it can find the C2 and communicate.

But I'm a bit confused. The question is whether it's likely that the implant will establish communication. The TTPs listed are about discovery, not communication. So maybe the answer is no, because the TTPs are about finding systems and connections, not sending data back to C2.

Wait, but in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, TTPs are techniques used during an attack. So, if the attacker uses T1018 and T1049, that's part of the initial phase to gather information. Once they have that info, they can then establish communication with their C2. So, the answer would be yes, because after using these discovery TTPs, the implant can then communicate with the C2.

Alternatively, maybe the TTPs are the methods used to communicate. But I think T1018 and T1049 are more about gathering info, not communication. So, perhaps the communication happens after the discovery phase.

Wait, but the question is whether the malicious implants will establish communication. So, if the TTPs listed are the ones used, then yes, because after using those, the implant can find the C2 and communicate. So, the answer is yes.

The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3, after being installed via macro execution, will communicate with C2 servers. The related TTPs are T1018 and T1049, which focus on system and network discovery. These TTPs help the implant gather information about the environment, which is a precursor to establishing communication with C2. Therefore, after discovery, the implant can identify the C2 location and initiate communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
