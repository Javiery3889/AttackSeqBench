Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Seaduke, after using a 'seppuku' function to delete itself and retrieve bot/system information, will communicate with its C&C server using HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs are T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1132.001-Standard Encoding.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control, so that's about communication methods. T1132.001 refers to standard encoding techniques, which could mean things like base64 or other encoding schemes used to hide data.

Seaduke is a tool, probably a bot, used by attackers. After it retrieves info and deletes itself, it might still need to send that info back to the attacker. The question is whether it uses HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding.

HTTP and HTTPS are web protocols, so T1071.001 fits. Layered encoding could be part of T1132.001. So, if Seaduke uses these, it would communicate via web protocols and use encoding, keeping it under control.

So, the answer should be Yes, because the TTPs suggest it's using web protocols and encoding, which aligns with the question's scenario.

The question revolves around whether Seaduke, after performing specific actions, will communicate with its C&C server using HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding. The relevant TTPs are T1071.001 (web protocols) and T1132.001 (standard encoding). Since these TTPs indicate the use of web-based communication and encoding, it's likely that Seaduke will indeed use these methods to maintain control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
