Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether cyber adversaries would use encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver obfuscated malware after installing malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Emotet and Agent Tesla are both malware used for things like reconnaissance and lateral movement. So, after they've installed these, the next step might involve evading detection. The question is about using HTTPS to deliver obfuscated malware.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two techniques mentioned: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information. Both of these fall under the Defense Evasion tactic. T1027.013 is about encrypting or encoding files, which could make them harder to analyze. T1027 is about obfuscation, which also makes files harder to detect.

So, if the attackers have already installed malware, they might want to protect their communications. Using HTTPS is a way to encrypt data, but how does that relate to delivering malware? Well, HTTPS is a protocol that encrypts data in transit, so if they're using it to send the malware, it would make the transfer secure. But wait, if the malware is already on the system, maybe they're using HTTPS to communicate with command and control centers or to exfiltrate data.

However, the question is specifically about delivering obfuscated malware. Obfuscation usually refers to making the malware harder to detect by hiding its true nature, like using encryption or other methods to mask its characteristics. So, if they're delivering the malware, they might use HTTPS to encrypt the transfer, but the malware itself might be obfuscated.

Wait, but the TTPs mentioned are about the delivery method. So, if they're using HTTPS to deliver the malware, that's more about transport security. But the obfuscation is about making the malware itself harder to detect once it's on the system. So, maybe the two TTPs are separate: one for encrypting the delivery (HTTPS) and one for obfuscating the malware.

But the question is whether they would use encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver obfuscated malware. So, the act of using HTTPS is a method of delivery, and the obfuscation is part of the malware's properties. So, it's likely that they would use both. Therefore, the answer would be yes, they would use HTTPS to deliver the obfuscated malware because it helps in evading detection by both encrypting the transfer and making the malware itself harder to analyze.

Wait, but the TTPs listed are both under Defense Evasion. So, maybe the question is about whether they use HTTPS as part of their defense evasion tactics. So, using HTTPS could be a way to avoid detection during transit, and obfuscating the files would help once they're on the system. So, both TTPs are part of defense evasion, making the answer yes.

The adversaries would likely use HTTPS to deliver obfuscated malware as part of their defense evasion tactics. HTTPS encrypts the transfer, aiding in evading network monitoring, while the malware's obfuscation makes it harder to detect once on the system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
