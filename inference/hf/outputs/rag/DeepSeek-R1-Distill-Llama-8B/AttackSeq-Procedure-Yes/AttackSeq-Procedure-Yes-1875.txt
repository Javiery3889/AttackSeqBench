Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13, after using ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and using BLUEAGAVE for command execution, would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to gain initial access into a victim's network. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1505.003-Web Shell and T1003.001-LSASS Memory.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1003.001 is about LSASS memory dumping, which is a technique used to extract credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS). This is often used in credential access attacks, like credential dumping. So, if FIN13 is using ProcDump, that's part of T1003.001.

Then, T1505.003 is about web shells. Web shells are malicious scripts that allow remote command execution, often used for persistence or further lateral movement within a network. So, BLUEAGAVE is a web shell, which would be used for command execution.

Now, the question is whether FIN13 would then exploit external servers and deploy web shells. Exploiting external servers usually refers to using vulnerabilities in other systems to gain access, but in this case, the TTPs mentioned are about credential access and web shells. 

FIN13's actions so far are about extracting credentials and then using a web shell for command execution. Deploying a web shell would allow them to maintain access or pivot to other systems. So, it makes sense that after getting credentials, they would deploy a web shell to establish persistence or further access.

I think the answer is Yes, so the answer choice A is correct.

The analysis indicates that after extracting credentials using LSASS memory dumping and executing a web shell, it's logical for the attacker to deploy the web shell to establish initial access. This aligns with the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A
