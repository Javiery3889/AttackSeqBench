Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SombRAT, after performing process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase, would communicate with C2 servers using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are Tactic: Command and Control with Techniques T1090-Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

First, I need to understand what each part means. SombRAT is a backdoor, so it's a type of malware that gives attackers access to a compromised system. During the Discovery phase, it would gather information about the system, like what processes are running, user accounts, network shares, etc. This phase is all about intelligence gathering.

Now, the question is about whether SombRAT would use proxy tools to communicate with its C2 (Command and Control) servers. The related TTPs mentioned are T1090-Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling. Let me break these down.

T1090-Proxy refers to using a proxy server to hide the Command and Control communication, making it harder to detect. This is a common tactic because proxies can mask traffic, making it look like it's coming from a different source or through a legitimate service. So, using a proxy would help in evading detection.

T1572-Protocol Tunneling is about using a tunneling technique to disguise malicious traffic as a legitimate protocol, like DNS or HTTP. This could be over a public or private network, making it harder to spot the Command and Control traffic.

So, during the Discovery phase, after gathering initial info, the attacker would likely set up methods to communicate securely. Using proxies and protocol tunneling makes sense because it's a way to avoid detection. SombRAT, being a backdoor, would probably use these techniques to maintain persistence and communicate without being noticed.

Looking at the answer choices, A says Yes, B says No. Since the related TTPs are about proxy and tunneling, it's likely that SombRAT would use these tools. So the answer should be A: Yes.

The analysis indicates that SombRAT would use proxy and tunneling techniques during the Command and Control phase to evade detection, aligning with the provided TTPs. 

Final Answer: A
