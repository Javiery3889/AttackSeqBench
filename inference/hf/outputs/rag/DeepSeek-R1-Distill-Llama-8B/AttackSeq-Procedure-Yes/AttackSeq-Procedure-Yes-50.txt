Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a PowerShell script that's evading defenses by using a specific DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk is likely to communicate with C2 servers to download Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. The question is about a potential attack sequence using PowerShell. The attacker is using a DCOM object with the GUID C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880. I remember that DCOM objects can be used in PowerShell for various purposes, sometimes for persistence or to execute commands without being detected as traditional executables.

The TTPs provided are Tactic: Execution and Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. T1059.001 refers to using PowerShell to execute files, which aligns with the scenario described. So the attacker is using PowerShell to execute files in memory, which is a common evasion technique because it's hard to detect since the files aren't saved to disk.

Now, the question is whether this script will communicate with C2 servers. I know that in many cyberattacks, after execution, the next step is to establish communication with command and control (C2) servers. This is often done via HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or other protocols. Malware like Ursnif and GandCrab are known to use such communication methods.

Looking at the related TTPs, the Execution tactic is about running code, but there's no specific mention of communication. However, in real-world scenarios, after execution, the next step is usually to send data back to the attacker's servers. So it's logical that the script would attempt to reach out to these C2s to download more malicious payloads or to receive further instructions.

I don't see any information that would prevent this from happening. The question doesn't mention any defense mechanisms that would block such communication. Therefore, it's plausible that the script would indeed communicate with C2 servers to download the associated malware.

The scenario describes a PowerShell script using a DCOM object to execute files in memory, a common evasion technique. Since the script is already using an Execution tactic, it's likely that the next step would involve communication with C2 servers to download additional payloads. Without any mentioned defenses against such communication, the script is likely to establish contact with C2s, making the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
