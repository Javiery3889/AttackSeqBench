Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Lokibot would escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before using process hollowing to bypass UAC. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Lokibot is a malware known for its capabilities in downloading second-stage payloads and performing various malicious activities. The question mentions that after a malicious macro downloads and executes a second-stage downloader, the third-stage payload is encrypted. So, the initial steps involve downloading and executing something that leads to the encrypted payload.

Now, the question is about whether Lokibot would inject a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe to escalate privileges and then use process hollowing to bypass UAC. I need to consider the related TTPs provided.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two main ones: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control and T1055.012-Process Hollowing. T1548.002 is about bypassing UAC, which is a privilege escalation technique. T1055.012 is process hollowing, which is also a privilege escalation tactic, often used to bypass UAC by running a process with higher privileges.

So, the question is whether Lokibot uses a DLL injection into Notepad.exe as part of its process before using process hollowing. I recall that some malware uses Notepad.exe as a payload delivery vehicle because it's a common legitimate process, making it harder to detect. Injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe would allow the malware to execute code with the same privileges as the process, which is a form of privilege escalation.

Process hollowing, on the other hand, is a technique where a process is injected into another process, typically to gain higher privileges. It's often used after initial access to escalate privileges further. So, if Lokibot uses process hollowing after injecting a DLL, it would make sense as part of its privilege escalation process.

Putting this together, the sequence would involve the malware first injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe to escalate privileges and then using process hollowing to further bypass UAC. Both T1548.002 and T1055.012 are related to privilege escalation, so the answer would be yes, Lokibot would do both steps.

The analysis indicates that Lokibot would indeed inject a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe to escalate privileges and then use process hollowing to bypass UAC. Both T1548.002 and T1055.012 are related to privilege escalation, supporting the sequence described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
