Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in question will use HTTPS for its command and control operations after it's discovered system information using specific commands. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware uses 'cmd.exe /c tasklist' and 'systeminfo' to gather system information. These commands are typically used for process discovery and system information gathering, which are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specifically, T1057 is about process discovery, and T1040 is about system information discovery. So, the malware is likely in the information gathering phase.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1057-Process Discovery. T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for command and control, which could include HTTPS. T1057 is about discovering processes, which aligns with the initial commands mentioned.

In the attack sequence, after gathering info, the next step might be establishing command and control. Malware often uses encrypted protocols like HTTPS to avoid detection. So, using HTTPS makes sense for communication to stay under the radar. The question is whether this is likely.

I think that in many cases, especially for more sophisticated attackers, they do use HTTPS because it's more secure and less likely to be blocked by firewalls compared to HTTP. So, the malware would probably switch to HTTPS after initial discovery to maintain anonymity and avoid detection.

So, putting it together, the answer is yes, the malware is likely to use HTTPS for C2 operations.

The malware uses commands for process discovery and system info, which aligns with T1057. After gathering info, it's common for malware to switch to HTTPS for C2 to avoid detection, as seen in T1071.001. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
