Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Korplug, after collecting data from various sources, would communicate with its C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, possibly starting with HTTPS or TCP for the initial handshake and then using encrypted TCP for the rest. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control, which could include things like HTTP or HTTPS. T1095 is about non-application layer protocols, which I think refers to protocols that aren't part of the typical application layers, maybe lower-level stuff like TCP or UDP.

Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. So it's gathering information, which is typical for initial stages of an attack. Now, after collecting data, it's likely to send this information back to its command and control (C&C) servers. The question is about the communication method.

The options mention a custom TCP-based protocol. Custom protocols can vary, but often attackers use protocols they control to avoid detection. The initial handshake could be over HTTPS, which is a web protocol, so that would align with T1071.001. But then, if the communication is encrypted over TCP, that might relate to T1095, which is about non-application layer protocols. Wait, but TCP is part of the transport layer, not the application layer. So T1095 would fit if they're using a protocol that's not part of the typical application layers, like HTTP or HTTPS.

So, the initial handshake could be HTTPS (T1071.001), and then subsequent communications could be encrypted using TCP, which is a non-application layer protocol (T1095). That makes sense because using different protocols can help evade detection. So the sequence would be HTTPS for the initial handshake and then encrypted TCP for the follow-up communications.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, because both T1071.001 and T1095 are used in the sequence described.

The analysis indicates that Korplug would use HTTPS for the initial handshake (T1071.001) and then switch to encrypted TCP communication (T1095), fitting the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
