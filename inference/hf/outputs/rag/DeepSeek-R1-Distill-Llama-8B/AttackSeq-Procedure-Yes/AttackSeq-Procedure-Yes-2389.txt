Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the TDrop2 malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that TDrop2 is a malware known for its use in targeted attacks, often used by APT groups. It's designed to be stealthy and persistent. The question is about its communication methods after initial discovery.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two techniques under Command and Control: T1132.001-Standard Encoding and T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding. I need to understand what these mean.

T1132.001 refers to standard base64 encoding, which uses the standard alphabet with characters like A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and some symbols. T1132.002 is about non-standard encoding, which might involve using a different set of characters, perhaps a custom alphabet.

The question mentions that the commands are encrypted and base64-encoded with a custom base64 alphabet. So, the malware is likely using a non-standard encoding because a custom alphabet would deviate from the standard one. This makes me think that T1132.002 is the relevant technique here.

Since the question is about whether this is likely, and given the related TTPs, the answer should be yes. So, the correct choice is A: Yes.

The TDrop2 malware uses non-standard base64 encoding, which aligns with T1132.002. This makes the communication with C2 servers possible with a custom alphabet.

Final Answer: A: Yes
