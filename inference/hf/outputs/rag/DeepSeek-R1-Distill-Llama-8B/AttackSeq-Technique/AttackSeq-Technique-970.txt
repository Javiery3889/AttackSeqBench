Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used before collecting data on installed software during the discovery phase. The question is about a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a cyber attack. 

First, I need to understand the question properly. The scenario is that the Aria-body backdoor collected detailed host and network information from a victim's machine. The question is asking which ATT&CK technique was used prior to gathering data on installed software as part of the discovery phase.

Looking at the answer choices, they are A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy, B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups, C: T1518-Software Discovery, and D: T1113-Screen Capture.

The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery

So, the attack is in the discovery phase, which is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework's initial steps. The goal is to gather information about the victim's environment. The question is specifically about gathering data on installed software, so I'm focusing on the software discovery aspect.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1518-Software Discovery is directly about identifying software on the system. That seems relevant because the question mentions collecting data on installed software. So, T1518 would be the technique used to gather that information.

Now, looking at the answer choices, option C is T1518-Software Discovery, which matches the related TTP provided. The other options don't fit as well. T1090.001 is about internal proxies, which is more about communication within a network, not software discovery. T1069.003 is about cloud groups, which is more related to cloud environments, not directly about software on a host. T1113-Screen Capture is about capturing screen data, which is more about monitoring activity rather than discovering software.

So, putting it all together, the most plausible answer is C: T1518-Software Discovery because it directly aligns with the action of gathering information about installed software during the discovery phase.

The correct answer is C: T1518-Software Discovery.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question focuses on the discovery phase where software information is collected.
2. The related TTPs include T1518-Software Discovery, which is directly relevant to identifying installed software.
3. Other options like T1090, T1069, and T1113 are not related to software discovery but to network communication, cloud environments, or screen capture, respectively.
4. Therefore, T1518 is the most appropriate technique for the described scenario.

**Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery**
