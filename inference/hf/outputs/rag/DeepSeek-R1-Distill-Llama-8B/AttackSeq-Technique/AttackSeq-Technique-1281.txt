Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used in this scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that Tropic Trooper used Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to execute commands, which gave them initial access. Now, when the backdoor's installer was deployed, it used a user's action or interaction to trigger it. I need to find out which ATT&CK technique fits this.

First, I remember that Tropic Trooper is a known APT group, so their tactics and techniques are probably well-documented. The initial access was through exploiting Equation Editor, which is a known vulnerability in older versions of Microsoft Office. That's T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is an exploitation technique.

Now, the next part is about deploying a backdoor's installer. The question mentions that the deployment was triggered by a user's action or interaction. So, the attacker didn't just use a scheduled task or some automated process; they needed a user to do something, like clicking a link or opening a file.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1573-Encrypted Channel. This is about using encrypted communication channels, which doesn't directly relate to triggering via user interaction.

B: T1564.009-Resource Forking. This is about creating new processes, maybe using legitimate tools, but not specifically about user interaction.

C: T1648-Serverless Execution. This is about using serverless computing, which isn't relevant here since the scenario is about a backdoor installer triggered by a user.

D: T1204-User Execution. This technique involves using user actions, like clicking a malicious link or running a file, to execute malicious code. That fits because the backdoor's installer was triggered by user interaction.

So, the most likely technique is T1204-User Execution.
</think>

The scenario describes a situation where a backdoor's installer is triggered by user interaction, which aligns with T1204-User Execution. This technique involves exploiting user actions, such as clicking a link or running a file, to execute malicious code. The other options don't fit as well because they relate to different aspects like communication, resource creation, or serverless execution, which aren't mentioned.

Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
