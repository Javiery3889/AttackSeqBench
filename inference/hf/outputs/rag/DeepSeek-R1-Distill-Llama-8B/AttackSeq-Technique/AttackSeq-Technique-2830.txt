Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used in this scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that BlackSoul established communication with a C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding. So, they're using some form of API or web-based protocol to send data. The question is about the specific technique used to transfer data over the C2 channel.

Looking at the answer choices, I have four options: A, B, C, D. Each corresponds to a different technique. The related TTPs provided are T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol. 

Let me think about each technique. T1048.001 is about exfiltration over a symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol. That might involve using something like a custom protocol that's not the typical C2, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. T1020 is automated exfiltration, which is more about exfiltration through application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. T1560 is about archiving data, which might not directly involve the C2 channel. 

The related TTPs mention T1041, which is specifically about exfiltration over the C2 channel. That seems directly relevant. T1095 is about non-application layer protocols, which could be something like using a different protocol to communicate, but the question is about data transfer over the C2 channel, so maybe that's more about how the communication is set up rather than the exfiltration method.

So, putting it together, since the question mentions using the C2 channel, the most likely technique is T1041. That's because the related TTP explicitly mentions this technique. The other options don't align as well with the scenario described.

The scenario describes the use of a RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON encoding for communication with a C2 server, indicating the use of a C2 channel. The related TTP T1041 specifically refers to exfiltration over a C2 channel, making it the most appropriate choice.

Final Answer: B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol
