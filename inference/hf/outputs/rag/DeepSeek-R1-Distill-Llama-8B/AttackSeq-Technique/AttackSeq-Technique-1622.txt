Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used by APT28 after they scanned IP ranges and identified vulnerable systems during their attack. The question is asking about the sequence of techniques they used, specifically after the initial scanning phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that APT28 is associated with a group known for targeting large organizations, often using sophisticated tactics. The question mentions that they scanned IP ranges, which is part of the reconnaissance phase. The related TTPs provided are T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks under the Reconnaissance tactic.

So, after scanning, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the systems they've identified as vulnerable. T1595.001 is about scanning IP blocks, which I think is part of the initial scanning phase. Once they have the list of vulnerable systems, the next step would be to discover more about those systems. That's where T1018-Remote System Discovery comes in. This technique is used to identify additional information about the target systems, like their versions, configurations, or other details that could help in further stages of the attack.

Looking at the answer choices, option D is T1018-Remote System Discovery, which fits perfectly after the initial scanning. The other options don't align as well. T1613 is about container discovery, which might be part of a different phase, like lateral movement or persistence. T1055.009 is about memory dumping, which is more of an exploitation technique, probably after access has been gained. T1048 is exfiltration, which would come after the data has been collected, not during the discovery phase.

So, putting it all together, after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, the next step would be to use Remote System Discovery to gather more detailed information on those systems. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: T1018-Remote System Discovery.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question is about the sequence of techniques used by APT28 during their attack, specifically after scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.

2. **Analyzing the Related TTPs**:
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique is used to gather detailed information about target systems, such as their configurations, which is a natural follow-up to identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This is part of the initial scanning phase to identify potential targets.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This is more relevant for container environments, not the immediate next step after initial scanning.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This occurs after data collection, not during discovery.
   - **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This is an exploitation technique, not part of the discovery phase.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This aligns with gathering detailed information post-scanning.

**Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
