Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used when establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols after using discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attacker used discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. I know that registry queries can reveal information about the system, like software versions, configurations, and other system state. Manipulating thread contexts might involve things like changing the way processes or threads run, which could be a way to hide or escalate privileges or bypass certain security measures.

Now, the question is about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS. I remember that HTTP and HTTPS are protocols used for data transfer over the internet, typically through web traffic. So, the attacker would need a way to communicate out using these protocols.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for command and control, which makes sense because HTTP and HTTPS are web-based. So, the attacker would use these protocols to communicate with their command and control servers.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: T1090.002-External Proxy. I think T1090 is about using external proxies, which can be used for tunneling or hiding traffic, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about establishing communication via HTTP/HTTPS.

B: T1498-Network Denial of Service. This is more about disrupting network traffic, not necessarily establishing a communication channel using specific protocols.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol. Wait, T1071 is about using web protocols, so this seems relevant. But the specific sub-technique is T1071.001, which is about web protocols, so maybe this is the right choice.

D: T1106-Native API. This involves using native APIs, which might be for interacting with the system at a lower level, but not specifically about HTTP/HTTPS communication.

So, putting it together, the attacker would use T1071.001 to establish command and control over web protocols like HTTP and HTTPS after doing initial discovery. Therefore, the answer should be C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
</think>

The correct answer is C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question involves establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS after using discovery techniques. This suggests the attacker is setting up command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Analyzing Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs mention T1071.001-Web Protocols under the Command and Control tactic. This indicates the use of web protocols for communication.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A (T1090.002)**: Involves external proxies, not specifically HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **B (T1498)**: Relates to network denial, not communication establishment.
   - **C (T1071.001)**: Directly refers to using web protocols for C2, aligning with HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **D (T1106)**: Involves native APIs, not web protocols.

4. **Conclusion**: T1071.001 is the correct technique for establishing communication via HTTP and HTTPS in this context.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
