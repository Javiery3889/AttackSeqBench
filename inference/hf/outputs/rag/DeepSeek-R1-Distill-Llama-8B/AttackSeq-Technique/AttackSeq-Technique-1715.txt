Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used after a spearphishing attack with a malicious .lnk file and the double extension trick for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attack starts with spearphishing using a '.lnk' file. I know that T1566.002 is specifically about spearphishing links, so that's part of the initial access. The double file extension trick is mentioned as a defense evasion technique, which is T1036.007. So the attacker is using this to avoid detection.

Now, after initial access, the question is about the communication between Mustang Panda and the compromised systems. I'm thinking about what happens after the initial access. The attacker would need to establish communication, probably using some command and control (C2) method. 

Looking at the answer choices, A is T1071-Application Layer Protocol. That's about using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for communication, which makes sense because those are common for C2. B is T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding, which is about encoding data in a non-standard way, maybe to avoid detection. C is T1010-Application Window Discovery, which is more about identifying applications, not communication. D is T1566-Phishing, which is the initial access method, so probably not the next step.

So, after the initial phishing, the attacker would use a protocol to communicate with their systems. T1071 is a likely candidate because it's a common method for establishing command and control. The double extension trick was for initial access, but now they need to communicate, so using a protocol like HTTP would make sense.

The correct answer is A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with spearphishing (T1566.002) using a '.lnk' file, which is a known technique for initial access.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The double file extension trick (T1036.007) is used to evade detection, allowing the attacker to avoid immediate detection post-initial access.
3. **Communication**: After establishing a foothold, the attacker would need to communicate with their command and control (C2) infrastructure. The most plausible technique for this is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, which involves using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for communication.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
