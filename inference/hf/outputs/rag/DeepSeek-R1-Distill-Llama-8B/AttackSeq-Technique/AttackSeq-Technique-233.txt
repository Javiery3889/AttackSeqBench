Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is most likely used here. The question is about a scenario where a batch file derived from a CAB file installs a main payload without triggering a UAC pop-up. The options are A to D, and the related TTPs provided are T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion tactics.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The malware is using a CAB file, which is a common archive format, often used for software installations. When a CAB file is executed, it's usually done through a batch file, which is a script that can execute commands. So the initial step is that the attacker decodes the CAB file to get the batch file, which then runs the payload.

The key point is that the payload is installed without a UAC pop-up. UAC is a security feature that prompts the user to confirm before certain actions, like installing software. So the malware must be bypassing this.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1566-Phishing. Phishing is about tricking users into giving up credentials or downloading malicious links. But the question is about bypassing UAC, not tricking the user. So maybe not this one.

B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. This technique involves exploiting or bypassing mechanisms that control access to resources. UAC is one such mechanism. So this seems relevant because it's about bypassing UAC.

C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs. This technique involves loading malicious DLLs at the start of a process to gain privileges. It's a privilege escalation method. If the batch file is running with some privileges, maybe this could help in bypassing UAC, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct method.

D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data. This is about purchasing access to systems or data, which doesn't directly relate to bypassing UAC. So probably not this one.

The related TTPs provided are both about bypassing UAC, one under Privilege Escalation and the other under Defense Evasion. So the key is that the technique used is T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control. That's exactly what the question is about.

So putting it together, the most likely technique is B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism because it's specifically about bypassing UAC, which would prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing.
</think>

The scenario involves a malware using a CAB file, which is decoded into a batch file to install a payload without triggering a UAC pop-up. The key is bypassing UAC, which is addressed by T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control. Among the options, T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism directly relates to bypassing UAC, making it the most plausible choice.

Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
