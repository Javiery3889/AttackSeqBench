Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this cybersecurity question. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a TDrop2 attack that evaded detection through process hollowing and retrieving a disguised payload. I need to determine which ATT&CK technique was used next to gather system information.

First, I remember that TDrop2 is a known attack framework used by APT29, which targets Windows systems. It's used for data exfiltration, credential dumping, and lateral movement. The question mentions that the attacker used process hollowing to evade detection. Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects code into a legitimate process, making it harder to detect.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, the only one mentioned is T1055.012-Process Hollowing. So, after successfully evading detection through this method, what's the next logical step? The attacker would likely want to gather more information about the system to proceed with further attacks.

The answer choices are A: T1106-Native API, B: T1082-System Information Discovery, C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, D: T1560.002-Archive via Library.

I know that T1106 involves using native APIs to interact with the system, which could be used for exfiltration or lateral movement. T1082 is about discovering system information, which would help the attacker understand the environment better. T1497 is about evading sandboxes, which might not be directly related here since the question is about gathering info after evading detection. T1560.002 is about archiving data, which might come later after information is gathered.

Since the attacker has already evaded detection, the next step would probably be to gather system details. So, T1082 makes sense because it's about discovering system information, which would help in further attacks like lateral movement or data exfiltration.

The attacker, having successfully evaded detection through process hollowing, would next seek to gather system information to facilitate further activities. Among the options, T1082-System Information Discovery is the most appropriate as it aligns with the goal of understanding the environment for potential exfiltration or lateral movement.

Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
