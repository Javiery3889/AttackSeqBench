Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 used valid account information to access networks via VPN instead of deploying backdoors. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question says that APT15 used Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping, so they probably used it to extract credentials from the system. With domain admin access, they can do a lot, including accessing network resources.

The options are whether they used the valid account info for VPN access or deployed backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, or RoyalDNS. I remember that APT groups often use multiple methods. But in this case, they already have valid credentials, so maybe they don't need backdoors.

Looking at the related TTPs, all of them mention T1078-Valid Accounts. T1078 is about using valid accounts, which could be for accessing resources directly. So if they have valid VPN credentials, they can just use those instead of installing backdoors, which are more for persistence or lateral movement.

So, it's more likely they used the VPN credentials they obtained, which is a direct way to access the network without needing to deploy additional tools. That makes sense because having valid accounts is a straightforward way to access systems without leaving a trace of other tools.

The question revolves around whether APT15 used valid account information to access networks via VPN instead of deploying backdoors. APT15 used Mimikatz for credential dumping, obtaining domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. The related TTPs all reference T1078-Valid Accounts, indicating a focus on using legitimate access methods. Since they already have valid credentials, it's logical they would use VPN access directly rather than installing backdoors, which are typically used for persistence or lateral movement. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
