Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in this scenario will establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours before the VBA macro uses it to download a dropper from a Blogspot URL. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial attack vector is a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document that has an auto-open VBA macro. When the user opens the document, the macro executes, which is a common way for malware to get onto a system. The macro is using 'mshta.exe', which I know is a legitimate Microsoft tool for running HTML applications, but it can also be used maliciously because it's a known exploit vector.

The question is about persistence. Persistence in cybersecurity terms means that the malware ensures it stays on the system, so it can continue to operate even after reboots or interruptions. Common ways to achieve this include scheduled tasks, registry changes, or startup programs.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1053.005 is about scheduled tasks, and T1059.005 is about using Visual Basic for scripting. The question mentions that the VBA macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper from a Blogspot URL. So the macro is using VBScript, which aligns with T1059.005.

Now, the key point is whether the malware would create a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours before the macro runs. The macro itself is using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper, which I assume is some kind of payload that might be more persistent or has further malicious actions.

I think that creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' would be a way to ensure that the process runs automatically at regular intervals, which could help in maintaining persistence. Since the macro is already using VBScript, it's plausible that the attacker would also set up a scheduled task to keep running the same or additional malicious code.

So, putting it together, the attacker would first use the macro to execute 'mshta.exe' to download the dropper. Then, to ensure this process continues without user interaction, they'd set up a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours. This way, the system keeps executing the malicious code, maintaining persistence and possibly deploying more malicious payloads or lateral movement techniques.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the malware is likely to establish persistence this way.

The scenario describes a phishing attack where a malicious PowerPoint macro uses 'mshta.exe' to execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. The related TTPs indicate the use of scheduled tasks (T1053.005) and Visual Basic (T1059.005). Since the macro is already using VBScript, creating a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours would provide persistence, ensuring the process continues automatically. This aligns with common persistence techniques, making the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
