Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether malicious documents are likely delivered through Initial Access after macros are enabled, especially when campaigns use obfuscation tools to bypass AppLocker. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Initial Access often involves the first point of entry into a system. Malicious documents, like Word or Excel files, are a common way attackers get in. When macros are enabled, these files can execute code, which is a big red flag.

Now, the question mentions that these campaigns use obfuscation. Obfuscation tools are used to hide malicious code, making it harder to detect. So, the attackers might be using these tools to make their Initial Access phase more stealthy.

Looking at the TTPs provided: T1204.002 is about malicious files, which fits with delivering payloads. T1027 is obfuscation, which would help in evading detection, like AppLocker. So, the idea is that the malicious files are delivered first, then they use obfuscation to avoid being blocked by defenses.

Putting it together, if the attackers use these TTPs, it's likely that the Initial Access phase involves malicious documents delivered through macros, and then they use obfuscation to bypass AppLocker. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The question asks whether malicious documents are delivered through Initial Access after macros are enabled, especially when using obfuscation to bypass AppLocker. The related TTPs include T1204.002 (Malicious File) and T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information). These TTPs indicate that malicious files are delivered first, followed by obfuscation to evade detection. Therefore, it's plausible that Initial Access involves malicious documents using macros, followed by obfuscation tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
