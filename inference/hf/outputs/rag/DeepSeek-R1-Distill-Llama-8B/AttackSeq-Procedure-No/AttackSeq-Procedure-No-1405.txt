Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering user account info after using WMI for lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that WMI is a Windows Management Instrumentation, which is used for remote management and can be a common tool for lateral movement in attacks. So, the attacker would use WMI to move across the network, which is mentioned in the question.

Next, the question is about whether FIN13 would then leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering user accounts. I'm a bit fuzzy on what exactly FIN13 does, but I remember that FIN13 is a tool used in attacks, often associated with APT29, which is a group known for targeted attacks. They are known for using various techniques to gather information once they've gained access to a system.

The related TTPs provided are T1078.002-Domain Accounts and T1003.001-LSASS Memory. T1078.002 refers to the use of domain accounts, which makes sense because accessing domain accounts can help in lateral movement within the network. T1003.001 is about LSASS memory dumping, which is a technique to extract credentials, like NTLM hashes, from memory.

So, the attack sequence starts with using WMI for lateral movement. Once they have moved laterally, they would likely want to gather more information. Using LSASS memory dumping (T1003.001) would give them credentials, which they can then use to access domain accounts (T1078.002). After obtaining these domain accounts, they might use native OS binaries and scripts to further gather user account information, such as enumerating user accounts, their details, and possibly their passwords or hashes.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this is likely. The options are Yes or No. Since the TTPs provided support this sequence—using WMI for movement, then LSASS for credentials, then domain accounts, and then using native tools to gather more info—it seems plausible that the answer is Yes.

The attacker uses WMI for lateral movement, then employs LSASS memory dumping to extract credentials, which are then used to access domain accounts. With domain access, they can leverage native OS tools and scripts to gather user account information. This sequence aligns with the provided TTPs, making the answer Yes.

Final Answer: A
