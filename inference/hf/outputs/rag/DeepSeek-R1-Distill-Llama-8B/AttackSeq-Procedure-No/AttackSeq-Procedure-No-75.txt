Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware will gather information about the infected computer after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs given are T1005-Data from Local System and T1083-File and Directory Discovery under the tactics Collection and Discovery, respectively.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1005 is about collecting data from the local system, which could include things like system information, user names, and other sensitive data. T1083 is about discovering files and directories, so it's about identifying what's present on the system.

The question mentions that the malware has already collected keystrokes, which is a form of credential dumping, probably using something like T1003.001 or similar. It also has directory listings, which would be T1083. So, after collecting these, the next logical step would be to gather more detailed information from the system. That's where T1005 comes in, as it's about extracting data from the local system, which would include system details, user info, etc.

So, the sequence would be: after collecting keystrokes and directories, the malware would likely use T1005 to gather more data, which it would then send via encrypted emails. That makes sense because after accessing the system, the attackers would want detailed information to further their objectives, like authentication or lateral movement.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The malware, after collecting keystrokes and directory listings, would use T1005 to gather detailed system and user information, which it would then transmit via encrypted emails. 

Final Answer: A
