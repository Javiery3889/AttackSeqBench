Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant used blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication with its C2 after initial reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Rising Sun implant is involved in some kind of cyber attack. The question is about its communication method after initial reconnaissance. The related TTPs mention Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication.

I remember that T1102.002 refers to using blogs or similar platforms for communication. So, the Rising Sun might be using these platforms to send and receive commands or data. Since the question is about whether it's likely, I should consider if using blogs and WordPress fits the TTPs listed.

I think that command and control (C2) is all about how an attacker communicates with their infrastructure. Bidirectional communication means both sending commands and receiving data. Blogs can be used as a way to post data or commands, maybe using comments or hidden messages. WordPress is a common platform, so it's plausible that an attacker would use it for this purpose.

So, putting it together, since the TTPs mention T1102.002, it's likely that the Rising Sun implant would use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication with its C2. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The Rising Sun implant is likely to use blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication with its C2, as indicated by the related TTPs. This aligns with the T1102.002 technique, which involves using such platforms for command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
