Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke would compress data using a custom LZW implementation before exfiltrating it via FTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CosmicDuke is a tool used by APT29, a group known for their advanced persistent threats. They often use various tactics and techniques to gather intelligence and exfiltrate data. The question is about their data collection and exfiltration process.

The question mentions that during collection, they skip certain file types. So, they're probably focusing on specific files that are valuable, like documents or data that's useful for their objectives. Once they have the data, they might process it further.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1560.002 and T1560.003. T1560.002 refers to archiving via a library, which I think means they use a standard library or tool to compress and store the data. T1560.003 is about using a custom method for archiving, which could involve custom scripts or tools they've developed themselves.

Now, the question is whether they use a custom LZW implementation. LZW is a compression algorithm known for its efficiency, especially for data that's repetitive or has patterns. The standard library might use a built-in LZW, but if they're using a custom implementation, that's a bit unusual unless they have specific needs.

I'm a bit confused because using a custom LZW might not be common. Usually, groups might use standard tools or libraries to compress data quickly. Custom implementations could introduce vulnerabilities or errors, which might not be worth it unless they have a particular reason, like avoiding detection.

So, considering that CosmicDuke is likely to use efficient and reliable methods, using a custom LZW might not be their usual approach. They might stick with standard libraries or other compression methods. Therefore, the answer is probably "No."

The analysis suggests that CosmicDuke is unlikely to use a custom LZW implementation for data compression. Given their focus on efficiency and reliability, they would more likely use standard libraries or other established methods rather than a custom implementation, which could introduce unnecessary risks.

Final Answer: B: No
