Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon would collect files from various information repositories after using their backdoors to access Office documents. The question is asking if they would automatically upload the harvested documents to their C&C server. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are listed as Tactic: Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration), Collection (T1119-Automated Collection), and Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1020 is about automated exfiltration, which means once the backdoor is in place, the adversary can send data out without manual intervention. T1119 is automated collection, so they can gather data from various sources systematically. T1083 is about discovering files and directories, so they can find what's available to collect.

So, the question is about the sequence after accessing a backdoor. Gamaredon would likely first discover the files (T1083), then collect them (T1119), and then exfiltrate them (T1020). That makes sense because you need to know what's there before you can collect and exfiltrate. So the sequence would be Discovery, then Collection, then Exfiltration. 

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether they would upload the files after listing them. Since all three TTPs are related, the answer should be Yes because each step logically follows the previous one. So the answer is A: Yes.

The sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (T1083) to identify files, then Collection (T1119) to gather them, and finally Exfiltration (T1020) to send them to the C&C server. This logical flow supports the answer.

Final Answer: A: Yes
