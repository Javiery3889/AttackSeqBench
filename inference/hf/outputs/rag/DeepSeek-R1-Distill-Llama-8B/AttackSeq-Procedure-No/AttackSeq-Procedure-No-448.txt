Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems as part of their data destruction activities. The question is about whether they would wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions. The related TTPs given are T1485-Data Destruction and T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe, both under the Impact tactic.

First, I need to understand what each TTP entails. T1485-Data Destruction typically refers to actions taken to delete or destroy data on a system. This could involve overwriting data, deleting files, or formatting drives. T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe is more specific, focusing on wiping the entire disk structure, which might involve using tools like sdelete or similar utilities to erase data beyond just deleting files, possibly using DoD-level sanitization.

Now, considering the context, Agrius is an APT group known for targeting OT systems, so their focus is likely on critical infrastructure. Data destruction is a common part of their operations, especially when they want to ensure that sensitive data isn't recoverable. They might use tools that are effective and thorough in wiping data, which would align with T1561.002 since it's a more thorough method.

Looking at the question, it's about whether they deploy CaddyWiper for wiping specific data. CaddyWiper is a tool that can wipe disk partitions, so it fits within the T1561.002 category. Since the question mentions wiping files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical partitions, using a tool that can handle disk-level wiping makes sense. T1485 would be more about deleting files, but the question is about a more comprehensive wipe, so T1561.002 is more appropriate.

Putting it together, since the question is about a disk structure wipe, the correct TTP would be T1561.002. Therefore, the answer should be yes, Agrius is likely to use CaddyWiper for this purpose.

The question asks whether Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction on OT systems, focusing on specific data types. The related TTPs are T1485 and T1561.002, both under the Impact tactic. T1485 is about data destruction, while T1561.002 is a disk wipe. Since the question specifies wiping at the disk level, T1561.002 is more relevant. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
