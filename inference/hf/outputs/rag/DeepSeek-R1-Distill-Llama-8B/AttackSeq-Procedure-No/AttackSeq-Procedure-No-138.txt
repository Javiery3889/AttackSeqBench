Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers will exfiltrate data by directly downloading cloud user data like OneDrive files after using the SLUB backdoor to perform discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the SLUB backdoor is involved in the initial phase. From what I remember, SLUB is a tool used in attacks, often part of the SolarWinds attack chain. It's used for lateral movement and persistence. So, the backdoor would allow the attacker to gain access to more systems within the network.

The question says that the backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute. A gist is a way to share code snippets, so maybe the attacker is using it to get some scripts or commands that help them move around or do specific tasks. Parsing the gist for commands suggests they're executing those scripts to gain more access or privileges.

Now, the related TTPs mentioned are T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage and T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol. T1567.002 specifically refers to exfiltration using cloud storage services, which could be something like OneDrive, Google Drive, or similar. T1048 is about exfiltration over alternative protocols, which might involve using non-standard methods like Tor or HTTPs for transferring data.

So, after using the backdoor for discovery, the next logical step for an attacker would be to exfiltrate data. Since they've already gained access to the network, they might use the backdoor to transfer data out. The TTPs provided are both about exfiltration, so it's likely they would use one of these techniques.

I think the key here is that the attacker has a way to move laterally and has access to cloud resources. If they can access cloud storage, they can exfiltrate data directly. The fact that they used a backdoor for discovery suggests they have some level of persistence and access, making it easier to exfiltrate data without being detected immediately.

I don't see any conflicting information here. Both TTPs are about exfiltration, so the answer should be yes, they are likely to exfiltrate data directly using cloud services.

The attacker, having used the SLUB backdoor for discovery and access, is likely to exfiltrate data using cloud services like OneDrive. The related TTPs T1567.002 and T1048 both relate to exfiltration methods, supporting the likelihood of this action.

Final Answer: A: Yes
