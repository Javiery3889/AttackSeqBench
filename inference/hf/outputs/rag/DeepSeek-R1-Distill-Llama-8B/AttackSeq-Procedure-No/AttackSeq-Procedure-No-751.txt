Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information after ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process. The question is asking if this happens, and I have to choose between Yes or No based on the provided TTPs.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

Let me break down each TTP.

Starting with T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique is about using web protocols for command and control. So, the attacker is probably using HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with their servers. This makes sense because HTTP POST requests were mentioned in the question, so the Rising Sun implant is using web protocols to send data back, maybe to a C2 server.

Next, T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery. This is about discovering the internet connection details. So, the attacker would gather information like IP addresses, DNS servers, etc., which might be used to establish a connection. This could be part of the initial setup before any persistence is established.

Then, T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. This is about persistence. The attacker adds entries to the registry or places files in the startup folder so that the implant starts automatically on boot. This ensures that the implant remains active even after reboots.

Now, the question is about whether the Rising Sun implant fetches computer name and user name after ensuring persistence. So, the sequence would be: first, the attacker uses web protocols to communicate, which is T1071.001. Then, they might discover the internet connection with T1016.001. Once they have that, they can establish a command and control channel. After that, they would work on persistence, which is T1547.001, placing the second-stage binary in the startup folder.

So, the attack sequence would be: Discovery of internet connection, then command and control via web protocols, and then ensuring persistence by adding to the startup folder. The question is whether the fetching of computer and user info happens after persistence. But wait, usually, persistence comes after establishing command and control. So, the attacker would first establish a connection, then gather info, then ensure persistence.

Wait, but the question says "after ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process." So, the download happens, then persistence is ensured, and then the info is fetched. But in the TTPs, the order is more like: first, they use web protocols for C2, then discover the internet, then ensure persistence. So, the info gathering (T1016.001) might happen before persistence. But the question is about whether the info is fetched after persistence is ensured.

Alternatively, maybe the Rising Sun implant's workflow is that it first establishes persistence by placing the binary in the startup folder, which would be T1547.001, and then after that, it uses the web protocol to fetch the info. So, the sequence would be: download, ensure persistence, then fetch data.

But the TTPs list includes T1016.001 as part of the related TTPs, which is about internet connection discovery. So, perhaps the Rising Sun uses that to find the internet connection before establishing C2. Then, after that, it uses T1071.001 for command and control, and then T1547.001 for persistence.

So, the steps would be:

1. T1016.001: Discover internet connection.
2. T1071.001: Use web protocols for C2.
3. T1547.001: Ensure persistence by adding to startup folder.

If that's the case, then the info (computer name and user) would be fetched during the C2 phase, which is after the initial discovery but before persistence. So, the answer would be No, because the info is fetched before ensuring persistence.

But the question says "after ensuring persistence," so maybe the info is fetched after persistence is set. That would mean the sequence is: download, ensure persistence, then fetch info. But the TTPs don't mention T1016.001 after persistence. So, perhaps the info is gathered during the initial discovery, which is before persistence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is about whether the Rising Sun implant will fetch the info after ensuring persistence. So, the steps would be:

- The attacker first communicates via HTTP POST, which is T1071.001.
- Then, they might discover the internet connection, T1016.001.
- Then, they ensure persistence by adding to the startup folder, T1547.001.

So, the info (computer name and user) would be fetched during the C2 phase, which is after the initial discovery but before persistence. Therefore, the info is not fetched after persistence is ensured. So, the answer would be No.

Alternatively, if the info is fetched after persistence, then the sequence would be: download, persistence, then fetch info. But the TTPs don't show that. The T1016.001 is about discovery, which is likely before C2 and persistence.

So, the correct answer is No, because the info is fetched before persistence is ensured.
</think>

The Rising Sun implant first uses web protocols (T1071.001) for command and control, then discovers the internet connection (T1016.001), and finally ensures persistence (T1547.001). The information is gathered during the command and control phase, before persistence is established. Therefore, the information is not fetched after persistence.

Final Answer: B: No
