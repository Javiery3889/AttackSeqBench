Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sayad malware would capture screenshots after performing discovery by collecting system and application details. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Sayad is malware, so it's likely involved in some form of cyber attack. The question is about its behavior after exfiltrating data. The options are whether it captures screenshots as part of data collection only after performing discovery, which involves gathering system and app details.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: T1560-Archive Collected Data and T1113-Screen Capture. T1560 is about archiving data, which makes sense because after collecting data, the malware would need to store it somewhere, maybe on a server. T1113 is about screen capture, which is a method to collect data, possibly for further analysis or exfiltration.

So, the question is about the order: does it do screen captures after discovery? I think that during the initial phase, the malware would first gather information about the system (discovery phase). Once it has that info, it might then proceed to collect more data, which could include screen captures. Alternatively, maybe it does both at the same time or in some other order.

Wait, but the question is specifically about whether it captures screenshots as part of data collection only after performing discovery. So, after it collects system and app details, does it then do screen captures? Or does it do screen captures first?

I think that in many cases, malware first does reconnaissance (discovery) to gather info about the environment. Once it has that, it might proceed to collect more data, which could include taking screenshots. So, the sequence would be: discovery first, then data collection methods like screen captures and archiving.

So, the answer would be yes, it's likely to capture screenshots after performing discovery.

The malware likely captures screenshots after performing discovery because it first gathers system and application details before proceeding with further data collection methods like screen captures.

Final Answer: A: Yes
