Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether, after accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts, the collected email accounts would be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Collection with T1114.001-Local Email Collection and Tactic: Collection with T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule.

First, I need to understand what each of these TTPs means. T1114.001 is about collecting email accounts using local email collection techniques, which makes sense because the question mentions accessing Outlook MAPI, which is a way to access email accounts. MAPI is used for syncing email, so if an attacker gains access to it, they can collect email addresses.

Then there's T1114.003, which is about email forwarding rules. This could mean that after collecting the email addresses, the attacker sets up a rule to forward emails to an external server, like an FTP server. So the idea is that once they have the email accounts, they might set up a forwarding rule so that any incoming emails get sent elsewhere.

So the question is whether this exfiltration happens automatically. The term "automatically" is key here. The TTPs mention collection and setting up forwarding rules, but does that happen without manual intervention? Or is it automatic once the rule is set?

I think T1114.003 is about creating a forwarding rule, which would require some configuration. So it's not automatic in the sense that it's an automated process without human interaction. It's more of a manual setup by the attacker. So the exfiltration wouldn't happen automatically; it would require the attacker to set up the forwarding rule, which might involve some steps.

Therefore, the answer would be No because the exfiltration isn't happening automatically through MAPI. The attacker would have to manually configure the forwarding rule, which isn't an automatic process triggered by MAPI access alone.

The question asks whether email accounts collected via MAPI would be automatically exfiltrated over FTP. The related TTPs indicate that T1114.001 involves collecting email accounts, and T1114.003 involves setting up forwarding rules. However, T1114.003 requires manual configuration, so exfiltration isn't automatic. Thus, the answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
