Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a malicious Office document that uses KerrDown delivered via macros or RAR archives would use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image instructing the victim to enable macros. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I know that KerrDown is a tool used by APT29, which is a cybercriminal group. They often use malicious Office documents, like Word or Excel files, to deliver malware. These documents might have macros that, when enabled, execute malicious code.

The question is about whether the Office document would use base64 blobs to execute the payload. Base64 encoding is a way to represent binary data in a text format, often used in things like JSON or URLs. Malware might use it to hide malicious code within a seemingly innocent file or to bypass certain security measures.

The delivery method here is via macros or RAR archives. RAR is a file format often used for archiving, but it can also be used to deliver malware because it can execute code when expanded. So, if the RAR archive is malicious, it might contain a payload that's base64 encoded.

The question also mentions that the Office document would execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture. That makes me think about how the payload is delivered. If the payload is base64, it might be extracted and executed based on the system's architecture, like x64 or x86, which are common in many Windows systems.

Now, the part about the document containing an image instructing the victim to enable macros. That seems a bit confusing. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. So, does it mean that the Office document first uses base64 to execute the payload and then includes an image telling the victim to enable macros, or is the base64 usage conditional based on the system architecture and then the image is part of the document?

Looking at the related TTPs, the only one mentioned is T1204.002-Malicious File, which refers to using malicious files to deliver payloads. This could include Office documents, RAR archives, etc.

I'm a bit confused about the sequence. If the Office document uses base64 to execute the payload, that might be part of the initial delivery. But KerrDown is known for using RAR archives that contain malicious payloads, which might be base64 encoded. So when the RAR is expanded, it might decode the base64 to extract the payload.

Wait, but the question is about the Office document itself. If the Office document uses base64 blobs, maybe it's embedding the payload as base64 within the document, which is then decoded and executed. Alternatively, the RAR archive might contain the base64 payload that's extracted and executed.

I'm also thinking about how macros work. Macros can execute code, but they can be a red flag for users. If the document instructs the user to enable macros, that's a common social engineering tactic to get the user to enable code execution.

So, putting it together: The Office document might use base64 to encode the malicious payload, which is then executed based on the system's architecture. After that, the document includes an image instructing the user to enable macros, which could be a way to trick them into enabling macros for a legitimate-looking image, but actually, the payload was already executed earlier.

Alternatively, the base64 might be used within the RAR archive, which is then expanded, and the payload is executed. The Office document might not directly use base64 but deliver the RAR, which does.

Wait, the question says the Office document uses base64 blobs to execute the payload. So the Office document itself is using base64, not the RAR. So the Office file might have embedded base64 data that's decoded and executed when the document is opened, especially if the user enables macros.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think that sometimes malicious documents might embed base64 strings that are then decoded and used to download or execute further attacks. So, if the Office document has base64 blobs that are used to execute the payload, that would make sense.

So, considering all this, the answer would be yes, the Office document would use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture, and then include an image instructing the user to enable macros as part of the document.
</think>

The Office document is likely to use base64 blobs to execute the payload because KerrDown often uses such encoding within Office files. The base64 data is decoded and executed based on the system's architecture. After the payload is delivered, the document includes an image prompting the user to enable macros, a common social engineering tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
