Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK's exploit server using a custom RC4 encryption would likely use proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that RIG EK is a known exploit kit that's used by attackers to distribute malware. They use something called an exploit server to deliver malicious code to victims. The question mentions that this server uses a custom version of RC4 for encryption. RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses the same key for encryption and decryption. That's different from something like AES, which uses different keys for each process.

Now, the question is about whether they'd use proxy servers in their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. Proxy servers can be used to hide the true origin of traffic, making it harder for security teams to trace where the attack is coming from. So, if RIG EK uses proxies, it could make their command and control (C2) communications more anonymous or hidden.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1090-Proxy and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography. T1090 is about using proxy servers, and T1573.001 is about symmetric cryptography, which aligns with the RC4 mentioned.

So, using a custom RC4 would help in encrypting the C2 communications, making them harder to decrypt without the right key. But the question is about using proxy servers, not just encryption. Proxies can mask the source IP addresses, making it harder to track the command and control traffic back to the attacker's infrastructure.

I think that using both symmetric encryption and proxies would enhance each other. The encryption ensures that the data is secure, and the proxy makes it harder to trace where the commands are coming from. So, it's likely that RIG EK would use both techniques together to evade detection.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether they will use proxies. The related TTPs include both the proxy and symmetric crypto, so it makes sense that they would use proxies as part of their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

The use of a custom RC4 encryption by RIG EK enhances data security, but the question focuses on whether proxy servers would be employed to obscure detection. Given that the related TTPs include both T1090 (proxies) and T1573.001 (symmetric crypto), it's logical that proxies would be used to mask C2 traffic, making detection harder.

Final Answer: A: Yes
