Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Shellbot would gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication via an IRC channel. The question is asking if it's likely to collect details like the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether tools like Splunk or antivirus are installed. The related TTP mentioned is T1082-System Information Discovery.

First, I need to understand what T1082-System Information Discovery entails. From what I remember, this technique involves gathering system information, which typically includes things like the OS version, hardware specifications, and other system details. So, the Shellbot would likely use this to gather such info.

The question is about whether it's likely to get specific details like processor cores and installed tools. Since the TTP is about system discovery, it makes sense that it would collect this kind of information. So, the answer should be yes, the Shellbot is likely to gather that info.

The Shellbot, after establishing C&C via IRC, would use the T1082 technique to gather system information, which includes details like processor cores and installed tools. Therefore, it's likely to collect the specified information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
