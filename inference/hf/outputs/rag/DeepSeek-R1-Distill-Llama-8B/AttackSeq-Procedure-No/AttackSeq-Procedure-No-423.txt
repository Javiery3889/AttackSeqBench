Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malicious PowerShell script in this scenario will execute before being retrieved via a VBS macro and then download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question says that the initial access is through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. Phishing emails often contain attachments, and in this case, it's a Word document. When the user opens the Word document, it's likely that the document might have embedded macros, especially if it's a common file format like .docx. So, when the user opens the document, their system might prompt them to enable macros to view content, edit, or for other reasons.

Now, the question is about whether the PowerShell script is encoded and will execute before being retrieved via a VBS macro. So, I need to think about how these files typically work. Word documents can contain embedded macros, which can be either VBS (Visual Basic Script) or PowerShell scripts. Sometimes, these macros are embedded as OLE objects or embedded objects within the document.

When a user opens the document, their system might automatically execute the macros if they're enabled. If the macro is a VBS script, it can execute and perform actions like downloading files or launching other scripts. Alternatively, if the macro is a PowerShell script, it might be encoded and require some steps to execute.

The related TTPs provided are:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This is about the use of malicious files, which fits with the phishing email attaching a malicious document.
- T1059.001-PowerShell: This is the use of PowerShell for execution.
- T1059.005-Visual Basic: This is about Visual Basic scripts, which could be embedded macros.

So, the initial attack is via a phishing email with a malicious Word document. The document likely contains embedded VBS macros or PowerShell scripts. If the macro is a VBS script, it can execute directly. However, sometimes malicious scripts might be encoded or require certain conditions to execute, like being retrieved via a macro.

Wait, but the question is about whether the PowerShell script will execute before being retrieved via a VBS macro. So, perhaps the malicious script is embedded as a VBS macro, which then triggers the execution of a PowerShell script. Or maybe the PowerShell script is embedded within the document and is executed via a VBS macro.

Alternatively, the VBS macro might be used to execute the PowerShell script. So, the sequence would be: the user opens the Word document, the VBS macro runs, which then triggers the execution of a PowerShell script. This PowerShell script then downloads Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Looking at the TTPs, T1059.001 is PowerShell, T1059.005 is VBS. So, the attack would involve using VBS macros to execute PowerShell scripts, which then download the malware.

So, the sequence is: Phishing email with malicious Word document, which has embedded VBS macros. When the user opens the document, the VBS macro runs, which then executes a PowerShell script. The PowerShell script then downloads Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Therefore, the answer would be yes, the PowerShell script will execute after the VBS macro is retrieved and runs.
</think>

The scenario describes a phishing attack where a malicious Word document is used to execute a PowerShell script via a VBS macro. The TTPs indicate the use of both VBS and PowerShell, which align with the described attack sequence. The VBS macro triggers the execution of the PowerShell script, which then downloads the malware. Thus, the sequence is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
