Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware uses the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the question is about whether the malware uses HTTPS for command and control and then uses specific commands to gather system info. The related TTPs given are T1082-System Information Discovery and T1057-Process Discovery. 

Looking at the techniques, T1082 is about discovering system information, which could involve commands like 'systeminfo.exe' or 'cmd.exe /c dir /a /s /b' to list files. T1057 is about process discovery, which typically uses 'tasklist' to list running processes.

The command in question is 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'. So, breaking it down, 'tasklist' is a command-line utility that lists all processes, which fits T1057. 'systeminfo' is another command that gathers system information, which aligns with T1082. 

Since the question mentions HTTPS is used for command and control, it's likely that the malware is using encrypted communication, which is common for avoiding detection. Once the C2 (command and control) is established, the malware would execute these commands to gather info, so the sequence makes sense.

I don't see any conflicting TTPs here. Both techniques are part of the discovery phase, which is a common initial step in an attack. So, the answer should be yes, the malware would use these commands.

The malware uses HTTPS for command and control, indicating it's likely using encrypted communication to avoid detection. The command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' combines 'tasklist' (T1057) for process discovery and 'systeminfo' (T1082) for system information discovery. Both techniques are part of the discovery phase, making the sequence plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
