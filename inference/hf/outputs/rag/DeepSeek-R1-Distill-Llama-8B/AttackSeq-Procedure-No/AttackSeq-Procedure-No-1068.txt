Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Yellow Garuda, after collecting data from Telegram, divides it into fixed-size chunks to exfiltrate and evade detection. The question is whether this is likely. The related TTPs given are T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1041 is about exfiltration over a C2 channel, which suggests that the data is being sent in chunks through a command and control channel. T1030 refers to data transfer size limits, which could mean that the data is split into specific, fixed sizes to avoid detection.

So, the question is whether dividing data into fixed chunks is a common tactic to evade detection. From what I know, cyber attackers often split data into smaller chunks to avoid detection. By doing this, they can send the data in parts over different sessions or through various channels, making it harder for defenders to notice the exfiltration. This is a common technique to avoid detection mechanisms like traffic analysis or intrusion detection systems that look for large data transfers.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since the TTPs mentioned include both exfiltration over C2 and data transfer size limits, it makes sense that the data would be divided into fixed chunks. This would align with T1030, which is about controlling the size of data transfers to stay under radar.

I don't see any information that would suggest that the data isn't divided, so the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

The question asks whether Yellow Garuda divides data into fixed chunks to exfiltrate and evade detection. The related TTPs are T1041 (exfiltration over C2) and T1030 (data transfer size limits). Both TTPs indicate that data is exfiltrated in controlled, possibly fragmented sizes to avoid detection. This is a common tactic to evade monitoring. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
