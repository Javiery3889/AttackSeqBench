Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether after receiving a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report, the recipients are likely to get spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery, and whether this happens only after they get infected with QuasarRAT. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution is about using an exploit to execute malicious code on a client, which would be part of the initial infection. T1566.001 is about spearphishing via attachments, which is an initial access tactic.

So the question is about the sequence of events. The scenario is that the recipients get a document that's a blog post or report. That's the initial access vector, probably via spearphishing, so that's T1566.001. Once they open the document, it could lead to infection, which would then trigger the next steps.

QuasarRAT is a remote access trojan, so once it's on the system, it can do various things, including lateral movement, data exfiltration, etc. But the question is specifically about delivering more malicious documents via RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8750. So after getting infected with QuasarRAT, the attacker might use it to drop more malicious files or send more emails.

Wait, but does QuasarRAT itself deliver the RTF files? Or is the RTF file part of the initial infection? The question says the recipients receive the document first, which is the initial attack. Then, after that, they get spear phishing emails with RTF documents. So the initial infection might be via the document, which could be via T1566.001, and then the QuasarRAT is part of the initial exploit, which then allows for further attacks, including sending more spearphishing emails.

So the sequence would be: Initial Access via T1566.001 (spearphishing attachment), which leads to infection with QuasarRAT (T1203). Then, once QuasarRAT is active, it can be used to send more spearphishing emails with RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8750, which is another T1566.001, but this time via email.

Wait, but the question is whether they will receive the spearphishing emails after getting infected with QuasarRAT. So the initial infection is via the document, which is T1566.001, leading to QuasarRAT (T1203). Then, QuasarRAT can be used to send more spearphishing emails, which would be another T1566.001, but perhaps under a different technique or as part of the same campaign.

So the answer would be yes, because the initial infection leads to QuasarRAT, which can then be used to send more spearphishing emails with the RTF files. So the sequence is Initial Access (T1566.001) leading to Execution (T1203), which then allows for more Initial Access via T1566.001 again.

Alternatively, maybe the RTF files are part of the initial infection, but the question says the recipients first get the document, then the emails. So the initial document is the first T1566.001, then the QuasarRAT is used to send more emails, which are another T1566.001.

So the answer is A: Yes.
</think>

The sequence begins with the initial access via T1566.001 (spearphishing attachment) through the legitimate-looking document. This leads to the infection with QuasarRAT (T1203), which then enables the delivery of further spearphishing emails containing RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8750. Thus, the recipients do receive the additional emails after being infected with QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: A
