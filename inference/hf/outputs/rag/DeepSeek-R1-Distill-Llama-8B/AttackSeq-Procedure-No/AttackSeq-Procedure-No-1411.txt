Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TeamTNT would scan IP ranges for open Docker API endpoints after using an open Weave Scope service to get initial access to a Kubernetes cluster. Then, they would set the downloaded coin miner's attributes to immutable and execute it for cryptocurrency mining. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs are T1204.003-Malicious Image and T1496.001-Compute Hijacking under the Impact tactic.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1204.003 is about using malicious images, which could involve Docker images that have backdoors or malicious code. T1496.001 is about compute hijacking, which might involve taking over a process or resource, like a GPU for mining.

So, the scenario starts with initial access via Weave Scope. Weave Scope is a container networking solution, so maybe they're using it to connect to the cluster. Once they have access, they might look for other ways to expand their access. Scanning IP ranges for Docker API endpoints makes sense because Docker API endpoints are often exposed on ports like 80 or 443, and if they're open, an attacker could use them to deploy malicious containers.

After finding such endpoints, they would likely download a malicious Docker image (T1204.003) and run it. This image could be a coin miner, which is a common type of malware used for cryptocurrency mining. Once the image is running, they might set its attributes to immutable to prevent it from being stopped. Immutable attributes in Kubernetes mean that the deployment can't be modified or deleted, keeping the miner running indefinitely.

The Compute Hijacking (T1496.001) might not fit here because that's more about taking over existing processes or resources, but in this case, it's about deploying a new resource (the miner) rather than hijacking an existing one. So the main TTPs used are about deploying a malicious image and setting attributes to make it persistent.

So, the sequence would be: access via Weave Scope, scan for Docker endpoints, deploy a malicious image, set attributes, and run the miner. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, TeamTNT would do this.
</think>

The scenario involves TeamTNT using Weave Scope for initial access, then scanning for Docker API endpoints, deploying a malicious image, setting attributes to immutable, and running a miner. The relevant TTPs are T1204.003 (malicious image) and T1496.001 (compute hijacking), but compute hijacking isn't directly used here. The main action is deploying a malicious image, so the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A
