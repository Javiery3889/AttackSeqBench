Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. The question is asking if this is a likely sequence of TTPs they'd use.

First, I need to break down the question. The scenario is about the initial steps of an attack. FIN13 is using native OS binaries and custom malware during discovery. So, they're probably starting with some initial access and reconnaissance. Now, the question is about what they do next.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, T1072-Software Deployment Tools, and T1083-File and Directory Discovery. Let me think about each of these.

T1570 is about transferring tools using lateral movement techniques. So, this could involve moving tools like AvosLocker across the network. T1072 specifically mentions software deployment tools, which are things like PDQ Deploy. So, if they're using software deployment tools, that fits here. T1083 is about discovering files and directories, which might be part of the initial discovery phase.

The question is whether after using native binaries and custom malware, they'd use software deployment tools for lateral movement. So, after initial access, they might deploy more tools using PDQ Deploy to move laterally. Then, after moving, they'd collect data from network shares and target specific info for fraud.

So, the sequence would be: use software deployment tools (like PDQ) to transfer tools (AvosLocker and others) for lateral movement (T1072). Then, after moving, they'd do file discovery (T1083) on network shares to collect data and target it for fraudulent transactions.

So, the answer would be yes, they would use software deployment tools as part of their lateral movement phase after initial discovery.

The analysis indicates that after leveraging native binaries and custom malware for initial access and discovery, FIN13 would likely use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy (T1072) to transfer tools such as AvosLocker for lateral movement (T1570). Following this, they would conduct file and directory discovery (T1083) on network shares to collect data, which would then be targeted for fraudulent transactions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
