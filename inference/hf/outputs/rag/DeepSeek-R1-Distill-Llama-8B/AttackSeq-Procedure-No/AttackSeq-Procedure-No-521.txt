Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack in question used mshta.exe to execute an embedded .hta file after using Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows remote code execution. So, if an attacker sends a malicious document, it can trigger this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. That's the initial access part.

Now, the question mentions that the attack scheduled a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to run a VBS file every 3 minutes. VBS files are Visual Basic scripts, which can be used for various tasks, including executing other files or commands. Scheduling tasks like this is a persistence mechanism, which means once the initial access is gained, the attacker can keep accessing the system over time.

The TTPs provided are T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and T1053.005-Scheduled Task. T1203 is about exploiting a client-side vulnerability to execute code, which fits with using the Word document exploit. T1053.005 is about scheduled tasks, which aligns with the task being set to run the VBS file.

So, the attack likely used the Word document to get initial access via CVE-2017-0199, then used a scheduled task (T1053.005) to execute the VBS file, which probably contains the mshta.exe to further the attack. The question is whether the .hta file was executed using mshta.exe after that.

Since the scheduled task runs the VBS file, and VBS can execute other executables, it's plausible that the VBS calls mshta.exe to run the .hta file. So, the sequence would be: exploit Word with CVE-2017-0199 for initial access, then use a scheduled task to run a VBS that triggers mshta.exe to execute the malicious .hta file. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.
</think>

The attack begins with exploiting CVE-2017-0199 through a malicious Microsoft Word document, granting initial access. The attacker then schedules a task to run a VBS file every 3 minutes, which in turn executes mshta.exe to run the embedded .hta file. This sequence aligns with the provided TTPs, indicating that the .hta file was indeed executed using mshta.exe after the initial exploit.

Final Answer: A: Yes
