Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13, after using BlueAgave, would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and malware, or if they use other methods like SixPack and trojanized KeePass for persistence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlueAgave is a passive backdoor that sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports. So, it's probably used for command and control (C2) because it listens for incoming HTTP requests. That makes sense because passive backdoors are often used for exfiltration or receiving commands from a remote attacker.

Now, the question is about whether they would then exploit external servers to deploy web shells and malware. The related TTPs include T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is about using web protocols for C2. T1505.003-Web Shell is about deploying a web shell, and T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which suggests using multi-stage channels for C2.

So, after setting up BlueAgave, which is a local HTTP server, it's possible that FIN13 would use this to receive commands or exfiltrate data. But would they then go on to exploit external servers? Or would they use other methods like SixPack and KeePass for persistence?

Wait, SixPack is a tool that deploys multiple payloads, including web shells, using a single payload. It's often used for lateral movement and persistence. Trojanized KeePass binaries are malicious versions of legitimate software, which can be used to establish persistence because they're trusted by the user.

So, after using BlueAgave for initial access, maybe they don't need to exploit external servers because BlueAgave itself is a form of C2. Instead, they might use SixPack to deploy web shells and malware, which would help in maintaining persistence and moving laterally within the network.

Alternatively, if they're using BlueAgave for initial access, they might not need to exploit external servers because the backdoor is already a way to command and control. So, perhaps they would use SixPack and KeePass for persistence after establishing access via BlueAgave.

Wait, but the question is specifically about exploiting external servers. Exploiting external servers would imply using something like a vulnerability in a web application to gain access, which might not be the case here. BlueAgave is a backdoor, so it's more about already having access and using it for C2.

So, maybe the answer is that they don't exploit external servers but instead use other methods like SixPack and KeePass for persistence. Therefore, the answer would be No, they wouldn't exploit external servers after using BlueAgave.
</think>

The analysis suggests that after employing BlueAgave, FIN13 is unlikely to exploit external servers. Instead, they would use SixPack and trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence and lateral movement, as these tools are more aligned with their objectives of maintaining access and control post-initial access.

Final Answer: B: No
