Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Fox Kitten Campaign would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after using Procdump and Mimikatz for credential access and pass-the-hash attacks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Procdump is a tool used to extract credentials, often from memory, and Mimikatz is used to perform pass-the-hash attacks. So the initial access is through credential dumping and then using those credentials to move laterally via pass-the-hash, which is T1550.002.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided, I see that the techniques mentioned are T1003.001-LSASS Memory, T1550.002-Pass the Hash, and T1550.002 again under Defense Evasion. Wait, that seems a bit redundant, but I think it's just emphasizing the use of pass-the-hash for both credential access and evasion.

The question is about whether PDQ Deploy would be used next. PDQ is a tool used for deploying malicious payloads, like malware, across a network. It's often used for lateral movement because it can spread from one compromised machine to another.

So, after getting initial access via credentials, the attacker would likely deploy tools or malware to move laterally. AvosLocker is a ransomware that encrypts files, so it's possible they'd use PDQ to distribute it. PDQ is a common tool for this kind of network-wide deployment.

I don't see any direct indicators that PDQ is not used in this context. The TTPs align with the steps: extract credentials, pass the hash for movement, then deploy more tools. PDQ fits into the lateral movement phase, so the answer should be yes.

The Fox Kitten Campaign, after using Procdump and Mimikatz for credential access and pass-the-hash attacks, is likely to use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. PDQ is a known tool for deploying malicious payloads like AvosLocker across networks, aligning with the TTPs mentioned.

Final Answer: A: Yes
