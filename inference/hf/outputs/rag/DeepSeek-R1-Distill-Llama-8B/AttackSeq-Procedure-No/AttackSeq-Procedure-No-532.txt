Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers and T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie, both under Credential Access.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1555.003 is about stealing credentials from web browsers, which could involve extracting cookies stored in the browser. T1539 is specifically about stealing web session cookies, which are often used for authentication. Both of these TTPs fall under Credential Access, which is a major part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The question is about whether the backdoor would use these TTPs to steal cookies from Chrome and Safari. Since the initial step involved using PowerShell to decode blobs into scripts that download more malware, it suggests that the attacker has already compromised the system. Once the system is compromised, the attacker can install malicious software that would allow them to access cookies.

Looking at the related TTPs, both techniques are about extracting credentials or session cookies. T1555.003 is broader, covering any credentials stored in web browsers, while T1539 is more specific to session cookies. Since the question is about stealing cookies, both TTPs are relevant.

The attack sequence starts with evading defenses by using PowerShell, which is a common tool for malicious activities. After that, additional malware is downloaded, which likely includes tools to extract cookies. Therefore, it's plausible that the attacker would use these TTPs to access sensitive information like cookies, which are often used for authentication and can grant access to more systems or data.

I don't see any reasons why these TTPs wouldn't apply here. The context fits with a Credential Access tactic, so the answer should be Yes.

The attacker, after evading defenses and using PowerShell to download additional malware, is likely to use the TTPs T1555.003 and T1539 to steal cookies, which are crucial for accessing sensitive information. Both techniques fall under Credential Access, making it plausible that the backdoor would target Chrome and Safari cookies.

Final Answer: A: Yes
