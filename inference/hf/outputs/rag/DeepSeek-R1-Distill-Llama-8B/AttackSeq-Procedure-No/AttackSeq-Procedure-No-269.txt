Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, specifically using HTTPS or TCP initially before collecting data. The question is asking if this is the case, and the answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs provided are T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1071.001 refers to Web Protocols, which typically involve using HTTP or HTTPS for communication. T1095 is about Non-Application Layer Protocols, which would involve using protocols like TCP or UDP directly without relying on higher-level application protocols.

The question is about the initial handshake. So, the initial communication between the malware and the C&C server. If it's using a custom TCP-based protocol, that suggests it's using TCP directly, not HTTP or HTTPS. But the question mentions HTTPS or TCP as the initial protocol used before data collection.

Wait, but T1071.001 is about web protocols, so HTTPS would fall under that. However, T1095 is about non-application layer protocols, which would be TCP without HTTP/HTTPS. So, if the initial handshake is over HTTPS, that's T1071.001. But the question says it's a custom TCP-based protocol, which might not be HTTP/HTTPS. So maybe the initial communication is over a custom TCP protocol, not HTTPS.

Wait, the question says "initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP". So the initial communication could be either HTTPS or TCP. But the TTPs given are T1071.001 and T1095. T1071.001 is for web protocols, so HTTPS would be part of that. T1095 is for non-application layer, so TCP without HTTP.

So, if the initial handshake is over HTTPS, that's T1071.001. If it's over TCP, that's T1095. The question is whether it uses a custom TCP-based protocol, so maybe it's using T1095. But the question is about whether it uses HTTPS or TCP initially. So the initial communication is either HTTPS or TCP, but the TTPs given are T1071.001 and T1095.

Wait, the question is about the initial handshake, so if it's using HTTPS, that's T1071.001. If it's using a custom TCP, that's T1095. So the answer would depend on which TTP is used. The question is whether it uses a custom TCP-based protocol, so the initial handshake is over TCP, which is T1095. But the options are whether it uses HTTPS or TCP, so the answer would be that it uses a custom TCP-based protocol, which is T1095, so the initial handshake is over TCP, not HTTPS. Therefore, the answer would be No, because the initial handshake is over TCP, not HTTPS.

Wait, but the question is whether it uses HTTPS or TCP, so if it's using a custom TCP, then the initial handshake is over TCP, so the answer would be that it uses a custom TCP-based protocol, so the initial handshake is over TCP, which is T1095. Therefore, the answer is No, because the initial handshake is over TCP, not HTTPS.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP", so if it's using a custom TCP-based protocol, that would mean it's using TCP, not HTTPS. So the answer would be that it uses a custom TCP-based protocol, so the initial handshake is over TCP, which is T1095. Therefore, the answer is No, because the initial handshake is over TCP, not HTTPS.

Wait, but the question is whether it uses HTTPS or TCP, so if it's using a custom TCP-based protocol, the initial handshake is over TCP, so the answer is that it does not use HTTPS, so the answer is No.

Alternatively, if the initial handshake is over HTTPS, that would be T1071.001, but the question is about a custom TCP-based protocol, so it's more likely using T1095. Therefore, the answer is No, it doesn't use HTTPS, it uses TCP.

So, the answer is No, because the initial handshake is over TCP, not HTTPS.
</think>

The question asks whether the Korplug variant uses HTTPS or TCP for the initial handshake before data collection. The related TTPs are T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol). T1071.001 refers to HTTP/HTTPS, while T1095 refers to TCP without HTTP/HTTPS. Since the question specifies a custom TCP-based protocol, the initial handshake is over TCP, which aligns with T1095. Therefore, the initial handshake is not over HTTPS, so the answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
