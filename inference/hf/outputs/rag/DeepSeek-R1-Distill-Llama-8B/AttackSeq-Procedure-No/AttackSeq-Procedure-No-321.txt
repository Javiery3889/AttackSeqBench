Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the app is likely to send information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about the app's behavior. It says the app uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations. Then, it's asking if the app sends the gathered info via HTTP after doing some routines on the iOS device. The options are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1071.001-Web Protocols under Command and Control, and T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol under Exfiltration.

T1071.001 is about using web protocols for C2. So, the app is using FTP, which is a web protocol, for its C2. That makes sense because FTP is a common protocol used for transferring files, even though it's not secure since it's unencrypted.

Now, T1048.003 is about exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols. So, after the initial C2 using FTP, the app might exfiltrate data using another protocol that's not C2, like HTTP, which is another web protocol. Since HTTP is widely used, it's a good choice for exfiltration because it's commonly allowed through firewalls and is harder to detect if used correctly.

Putting this together, the app uses FTP for C2 and then uses HTTP for exfiltration. So, after performing routines, it's likely to send data via HTTP. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The app uses FTP for C2 and then exfiltrates data via HTTP, a common non-C2 protocol. This aligns with the TTPs provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
