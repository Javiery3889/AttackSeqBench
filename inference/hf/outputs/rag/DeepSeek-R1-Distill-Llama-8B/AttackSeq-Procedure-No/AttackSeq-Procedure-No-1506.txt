Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK's exploit server would use domain fronting to disguise its command and control traffic. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that RIG EK is a known exploit kit used by cyber adversaries. They're known for using various techniques to evade detection. The question mentions that they've already been using proxy servers within their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. So, they're already taking steps to obfuscate their traffic.

Now, the question is about whether they would use domain fronting as another method. Domain fronting is a technique where the domain name used in a URL is different from the actual destination. This can make it harder to trace where the traffic is going because the initial domain might resolve to a legitimate-looking server, possibly within the same Content Delivery Network (CDN). This would disguise the command and control traffic, making it appear as if it's coming from a trusted source.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1090-Proxy and T1090.004-Domain Fronting. T1090-Proxy refers to the use of proxy servers, which we already know RIG EK is using. T1090.004 is specifically about domain fronting. So, both techniques fall under the same tactic of Command and Control.

Since RIG EK is already using proxies, it makes sense that they'd use another layer of deception like domain fronting. This would add another layer of obfuscation, making it harder for defenders to identify where the command and control traffic is going. Domain fronting is a common technique used in the same context as using proxies, so it's plausible that RIG EK would employ both together.

I don't see any conflicting information in the related TTPs that would suggest they wouldn't use domain fronting. Both techniques are part of the same tactic, so using them together is logical for an adversary trying to evade detection.

The question asks whether RIG EK, after using proxy servers, would employ domain fronting for command and control. Given that both techniques (proxy and domain fronting) are related under the Command and Control tactic, it's logical that RIG EK would use domain fronting to add another layer of obfuscation. This aligns with common adversary behavior, making the answer likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
