Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the campaign using phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after the initial access through a malicious document. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking if the observed campaign, which uses phishing emails, will exploit a specific vulnerability, CVE-2018-13379, in FortiOS devices. The initial access is through a malicious document called 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. Both of these are under the Initial Access tactic.

T1190 refers to exploiting public-facing applications, which could mean using a known vulnerability in software that's accessible to the public. CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, which is a widely used network security appliance. So, if the attacker is exploiting this, it's likely they're using a public-facing application exploit.

T1566.001 is about spearphishing attachments. This makes sense because the initial access is through a phishing email with a malicious document attached. So the attacker is tricking someone into opening the document, which could lead to further exploitation.

Putting this together, the campaign starts with phishing emails (spearphishing) to get initial access, and then uses an exploit (CVE-2018-13379) to gain further access. So the sequence is: Phishing email (T1566.001) leading to initial access, then exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) using the vulnerability.

Wait, but the question is whether the campaign will exploit the CVE after initial access. So after the phishing email is used to get in, the next step is using the exploit. So the sequence is T1566.001 followed by T1190. So the answer should be Yes, because the TTPs align with that sequence.
</think>

The campaign begins with a phishing email (T1566.001) that tricks the user into opening a malicious document, which then leads to the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 (T1190). This sequence aligns with the attack described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
