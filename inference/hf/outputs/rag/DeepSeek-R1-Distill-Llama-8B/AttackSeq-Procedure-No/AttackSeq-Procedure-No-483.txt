Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. The question is asking if, after running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor and communicate via HTTPS, it's likely that it used remote code execution in internet-facing apps for Initial Access.

First, I need to break down the question. SparrowDoor is a malware, I think, and it's being executed using cmd.exe. They're communicating over HTTPS, which is encrypted, so that's probably for Command and Control (C&C). The main point is whether this indicates Initial Access via exploiting public-facing apps.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application under Initial Access, and T1059.003-Windows Command Shell under Execution. T1190 suggests that the attacker exploited a public-facing app to gain access, which is Initial Access. T1059.003 is about using a command shell, which is part of Execution tactics.

So, the question is about Initial Access. The action of running cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor implies using a command shell, which aligns with T1059.003. But the main point is whether this was done via exploiting a public-facing app, which would be T1190.

I think that when malware uses a command shell, it's part of the Execution phase, not necessarily the Initial Access. Initial Access is more about how they got into the system in the first place. So if SparrowDoor exploited a public-facing app, that's Initial Access, and then they used a command shell to execute it.

So the question is, did SparrowDoor use that exploit for Initial Access? The fact that they're using cmd.exe suggests they're using a command shell, but that's Execution, not Initial Access. The Initial Access would be the T1190 part.

Wait, but the question is about whether the Initial Access was via exploiting public-facing apps. So if they used a vulnerability in a public app to get in, that's T1190. Then, once they have access, they might use a command shell to execute SparrowDoor.

So the answer would be yes, because the Initial Access was through exploiting a public-facing app, which is T1190, and then using a command shell for Execution, which is T1059.003.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

The question asks if SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution in internet-facing apps for Initial Access. The related TTPs indicate that T1190 refers to exploiting public-facing apps for Initial Access, and T1059.003 is about using a command shell for Execution. Since the question focuses on Initial Access, the correct answer is that SparrowDoor used T1190, making the answer yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
