Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network after compromising a computer using Nmap and Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that GreyEnergy is a cyber group associated with Russia, and they often use various tools in their attacks. They compromised a computer, so they've already gained initial access. They used Nmap, which is a network scanning tool, so that makes sense for mapping the network. Mimikatz is a credential dumping tool, so they probably used it to collect credentials, which would help in lateral movement.

Now, the question is about their next steps. PDQ Deploy is a tool used for deploying software, like payloads or tools across a network. So, if they want to move tools like AvosLocker and other tools, they might use PDQ Deploy. But I need to look at the related TTPs provided.

The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072-Software Deployment Tools

So, T1072 is about deploying software, which fits with PDQ Deploy. T1570 is about transferring tools laterally, which could involve using PDQ Deploy to push tools. T1018 is about discovering systems, which they've already done with Nmap, but maybe they use it again for further discovery.

Looking at the answer choices, A is Yes, B is No. So, if the group is moving tools across the network, T1570 suggests they transfer tools, which PDQ Deploy can do. T1072 is about deploying software, which PDQ Deploy is known for. So, it makes sense that they would use PDQ Deploy after initial compromise to deploy more tools and payloads.

I don't see any reasons why they wouldn't use PDQ Deploy here. They've already done network discovery and credential collection, so the next logical step would be to deploy tools for persistence, lateral movement, and payload delivery. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a system with Nmap and Mimikatz, would likely use PDQ Deploy to move tools like AvosLocker. The related TTPs indicate they use techniques for software deployment (T1072) and lateral tool transfer (T1570), which align with PDQ Deploy's functionality. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
