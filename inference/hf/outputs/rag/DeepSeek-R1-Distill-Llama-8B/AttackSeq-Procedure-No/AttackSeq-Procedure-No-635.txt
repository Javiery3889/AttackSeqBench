Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers used heap spraying techniques before inserting malicious JavaScript into a Korean-language news portal. The question is whether they used heap spraying to gain arbitrary read/write access and execute shellcode. The related TTPs given are T1189-Drive-by Compromise and T1059.007-JavaScript under the Execution tactic.

First, I need to understand what heap spraying is. From what I remember, heap spraying is a technique used in web attacks where malicious JavaScript code is injected into web pages to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. It's often used in drive-by attacks, where the attacker doesn't need to trick the user into clicking anything. The code is injected into a page as it's being loaded, which can then exploit a vulnerability in the browser or a library.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1189 is Drive-by Compromise, which is a type of attack where the attacker uses a web application vulnerability to inject malicious code into a legitimate-looking website. This is exactly what's happening here since the malicious JavaScript was inserted into a news portal, a legitimate site. So that fits with T1189.

Then there's T1059.007, which is about using JavaScript for execution. Since the attack involved JavaScript code being inserted, this makes sense. JavaScript is a common vector for executing malicious code on web browsers, especially if it's exploiting a known vulnerability like CVE-2019-13720, which I think is a memory corruption vulnerability in Google Chrome.

Heap spraying is a specific method of delivering malicious JavaScript to exploit such vulnerabilities. It's a common technique used in drive-by attacks because it doesn't require user interaction beyond visiting the site. The malicious code is injected into the page's HTML, and when the browser tries to execute it, it triggers the exploit.

So putting it together, the attack would involve using T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) as the initial tactic, where the malicious JavaScript is injected into the portal. Then, the Execution tactic uses T1059.007 (JavaScript) to execute the code. Since heap spraying is a method under the Drive-by Compromise tactic, it's likely that the attackers used it here.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, they did use heap spraying techniques.

The attack involved injecting malicious JavaScript into a legitimate news portal, which aligns with the Drive-by Compromise (T1189) tactic. This method often uses heap spraying to deliver the exploit, which is a technique under the Execution (T1059.007) tactic. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
