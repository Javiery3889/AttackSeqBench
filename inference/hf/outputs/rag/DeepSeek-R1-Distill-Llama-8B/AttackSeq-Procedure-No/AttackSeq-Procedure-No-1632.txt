Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether an adversary would split files into smaller chunks if the file size is 1,000,000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them from SharePoint Online. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the question is about the likelihood of the adversary dividing files during the exfiltration phase. The related TTPs mentioned are Tactic: Collection and Technique: T1213.002-Sharepoint, and Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.

Looking at the exfiltration TTP, T1030 refers to data transfer size limits. This technique usually involves an adversary trying to avoid detection by limiting the size of data transferred in each session, often by splitting files into smaller chunks. So, if a file is too large, the adversary might split it to avoid exceeding the size limit set by the target's network or security measures.

Now, the question is about whether the adversary would divide files that are 1MB or more. Since 1MB isn't that large in today's context, especially for data exfiltration, it's more likely that the adversary would split larger files, say 1GB or more, to avoid detection. However, the question specifies 1,000,000 bytes, which is 1MB. I'm not sure if 1MB is typically split or not. Maybe in some cases, but perhaps it's more common for larger files.

But wait, the TTP T1030 specifically mentions data transfer size limits, which could be set by the defender. If the defender's limit is, say, 1MB per transfer, then the adversary would split larger files into smaller chunks to avoid detection. So if the file is exactly 1MB, maybe they wouldn't split it because it's within the limit. But if it's larger, they would. However, the question is about files that are 1MB or more, so if the file is exactly 1MB, maybe they don't split it, but if it's more, they do. But the question is phrased as "or more," so it's about files that are 1MB or larger. So, the adversary would split them if they are larger than 1MB, but not if they're exactly 1MB.

Wait, but the question is whether they would divide the files if the size is 1,000,000 bytes or more. So, if the file is 1MB or more, they would split it. So the answer would be yes, they would divide the files.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes 1MB isn't that big in today's context. Maybe the defender's limit is higher, like 5MB or more. So, if the file is 1MB, it's under the limit, so no split. But if it's more, then yes. But the question is about files that are 1MB or more, so if the file is exactly 1MB, maybe they don't split it, but if it's larger, they do. So the answer would depend on whether the file is over the limit. But the question is phrased as "or more," so perhaps the adversary would split any file that's 1MB or more, assuming the defender's limit is 1MB.

Alternatively, maybe the T1030 technique is about the maximum size per transfer, so if the file is larger, they split it. So, yes, they would divide the files if they are 1MB or more.

So, putting it together, the answer is yes, the adversary would split the files if they are 1MB or more because they want to avoid detection by staying under the data transfer limits.

The adversary would likely split files that are 1,000,000 bytes or more to avoid detection, as this aligns with the T1030 technique related to data transfer size limits.

Final Answer: A: Yes
