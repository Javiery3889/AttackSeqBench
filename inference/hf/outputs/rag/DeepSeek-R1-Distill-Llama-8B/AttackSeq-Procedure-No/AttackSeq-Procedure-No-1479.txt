Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Seaduke will use the 'seppuku' function to retrieve bot/system information and delete itself after communicating with its C&C server. The question mentions that Seaduke communicates via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption. The related TTPs are T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1132.001-Standard Encoding.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control, which fits with the question since Seaduke is using HTTP/HTTPS. T1132.001 is about standard encoding, which probably refers to techniques like base64 or other methods to hide data during communication.

Now, the question is whether Seaduke will retrieve info and delete itself. The 'seppuku' function sounds like a self-destruction or self-removal mechanism. So, after establishing a connection with the C&C, the bot would likely execute commands. Since it's using web protocols, the next step could be to send a command to retrieve data, maybe using the T1071.001 technique. Then, to delete itself, it might use another command, possibly leveraging the T1132.001 for encoding to avoid detection.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this is likely. Since both TTPs are related to communication and encoding, it makes sense that Seaduke would use these to both gather info and remove itself securely. So, the answer should be yes.

The question revolves around whether Seaduke, after communicating with its C&C server using HTTP/HTTPS with encoding, will use the 'seppuku' function to retrieve information and delete itself. The related TTPs are T1071.001 (Web Protocols) and T1132.001 (Standard Encoding). 

1. **T1071.001** involves using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the communication method described.
2. **T1132.001** pertains to encoding techniques, which would be used to securely delete the bot.

Given these TTPs, it's plausible that Seaduke would use these techniques to both retrieve information and securely delete itself. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
