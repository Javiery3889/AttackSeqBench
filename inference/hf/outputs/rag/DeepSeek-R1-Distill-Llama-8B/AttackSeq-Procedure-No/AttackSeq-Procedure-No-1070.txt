Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper would drop RegAsm.exe before injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Tropic Trooper is a malware associated with the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. They're known for their attacks on various targets, including financial institutions. They use different tactics and techniques during their attacks.

The question mentions using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. Equation Editor is a legitimate tool used for editing equations, but it's been used in attacks to deliver malicious code. So, the initial step is that the attackers use Equation Editor to drop some payload, which is an installer package. This installer probably contains malicious code, maybe a payload that's dropped onto the system.

Now, the question is about what Tropic Trooper does after that. The options are whether they drop RegAsm.exe or inject a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe. I remember that Tropic Trooper is known for using DLL injection techniques. DLL injection allows a process to load a dynamic-link library (DLL) into another process's address space, effectively hooking functions or gaining persistence.

Looking at the related TTPs, the technique mentioned is T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection. This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, such as dllhost.exe, which is a process that runs as a service. Injecting a DLL into this process can provide persistence because the malicious code can run at a higher privilege level or avoid detection.

RegAsm.exe is a legitimate tool used to register DLLs. It's used by system administrators to register .dll files so that they are recognized by the system. However, in the context of malicious activity, RegAsm.exe could be used to register a malicious DLL, making it persist on the system. But the question is whether Tropic Trooper specifically uses RegAsm.exe before the DLL injection.

I think Tropic Trooper's typical behavior is to inject malicious DLLs into legitimate processes rather than using RegAsm.exe. They might use RegAsm.exe if they need to register a DLL, but more commonly, they inject the DLL directly into processes like dllhost.exe. So, the sequence would be: using Equation Editor to drop the installer, which might execute some malicious code, then using a technique like T1055.001 to inject the malicious DLL into a process, not necessarily using RegAsm.exe first.

Wait, but sometimes RegAsm.exe is used to register a DLL, which could be a step before injection. Maybe the malicious DLL is first registered using RegAsm.exe and then injected. But I'm not sure if Tropic Trooper specifically does that. From what I recall, Tropic Trooper tends to use DLL injection techniques rather than relying on RegAsm.exe. So, the more likely step is that after dropping the payload, they inject the malicious DLL into a process like dllhost.exe without using RegAsm.exe first.

So, putting it together, the answer would be that Tropic Trooper is not likely to drop RegAsm.exe before the DLL injection. Therefore, the answer is No.

The analysis indicates that Tropic Trooper is more likely to inject a malicious DLL into a process like dllhost.exe rather than using RegAsm.exe. The related TTP T1055.001 suggests a focus on DLL injection, aligning with Tropic Trooper's known tactics.

Final Answer: B: No
