Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement after using tools like AFind and port scanning. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that AFind is a tool used for active directory enumeration. It helps in gathering information about the domain and network, which could include user accounts, group memberships, and other sensitive data. Port scanning tools are used to map out which ports are open and which services are running on the network, which can help in identifying potential attack vectors.

Now, the question is about whether the attackers would use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement. SAML tokens are used for single sign-on solutions, especially in enterprise environments. If an attacker compromises an AD FS server, they might be able to obtain a SAML token, which could grant them access to other resources without needing to authenticate each time.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three: two under Lateral Movement and one under Credential Access. The Lateral Movement techniques mention using alternate authentication material, which aligns with the idea of using a SAML token to move laterally. The Credential Access technique is also about using SAML tokens, which fits the scenario.

So, if an attacker has access to a SAML token from a compromised AD FS server, they can use it to access other services that trust the AD FS, allowing them to move laterally within the network without being detected as a new threat. This makes sense because SAML tokens can provide a persistent way to access resources across different domains or services.

I don't see any conflicting information here. The techniques all point towards the possibility of lateral movement using SAML tokens. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that attackers would abuse this.

The attacker can use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to access other services, enabling lateral movement across the network without detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
