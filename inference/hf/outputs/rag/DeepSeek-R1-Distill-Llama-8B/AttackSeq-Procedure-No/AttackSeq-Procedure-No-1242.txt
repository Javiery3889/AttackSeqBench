Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 would divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more when uploading stolen information to a C&C server. The question is asking if they would split the files in this case. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1020 is about automated exfiltration, which probably means they use tools or scripts to transfer data without manual intervention. T1030 is about data transfer size limits, so maybe they split files to avoid detection by size restrictions.

So, if the file is 1MB or more, which is 0x1000000 bytes, the question is whether APT28 would split it. I know that some attackers split files to avoid exceeding the size limits set by the target's network, like firewalls or email systems. For example, if an email has a size limit of 25MB, they might split a larger file into smaller chunks to send them in multiple emails.

Looking at the TTPs, T1030 specifically mentions data transfer size limits, so that's a clue. If the file is too big, they might use T1020 to automate the exfiltration process, perhaps splitting the file into parts. So, yes, they would divide the file to fit within the transfer limits.

I think the answer is Yes because the TTPs suggest they handle large files by splitting them to avoid detection.

The question revolves around whether APT28 would split a file exceeding 1MB when exfiltrating data. The related TTPs indicate that T1020 (automated exfiltration) and T1030 (data size limits) are relevant. Since T1030 deals with size restrictions, APT28 would likely use T1020 to split the file into smaller parts to avoid detection. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A
