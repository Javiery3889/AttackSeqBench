Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke malware captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CosmicDuke is a malware associated with APT29, which is a group known for targeted attacks, often against organizations, possibly for espionage. The question is about whether it captures credentials from a manipulated login page on Ivanti Connect Secure.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are three entries. Two are under the Collection tactic, one is T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, and the other is T1056.001-Keylogging. The third is also Collection with the same T1056.003-Web Portal Capture.

I remember that T1056.003 refers to capturing credentials from web portals. So, if the Ivanti Connect Secure login page is a web portal, then this TTP would apply. Keylogging (T1056.001) is about capturing keystrokes, which could also get credentials, but the question specifically mentions the login page, so it's more about web-based credential capture.

Since the question is about credentials entered on the login page, the TTP T1056.003-Web Portal Capture is more directly relevant. The keylogging could also be used, but the question seems to focus on the web portal method. So, the malware is likely using both methods, but the primary one here is the web portal capture.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that CosmicDuke captures those credentials.

The question asks if CosmicDuke malware captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page. The related TTPs include T1056.003-Web Portal Capture and T1056.001-Keylogging. Since the question focuses on a web portal, T1056.003 is the relevant TTP, indicating that credentials are captured from the login page. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
