Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether WinDealer communicates with C2 servers using non-standard ports like 6999 or 55556 before stealing info and encrypting it with AES. The options are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs are T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol under Command and Control.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1571 is about using non-standard ports, which are not the usual ones like HTTP or HTTPS. T1095 is about using non-standard application layer protocols, which might mean something like using custom protocols instead of common ones.

WinDealer is likely a malware or an attacker group. They probably use C2 (Command and Control) to communicate with their servers. If they use non-standard ports, that's a way to avoid detection since standard ports are often monitored. So, using ports like 6999 or 55556 makes sense as a way to evade firewalls and other security tools.

Also, T1095 suggests they might not use common protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, maybe using something else, which could be part of their communication method. So, if they're using non-standard ports and non-standard protocols, that's a strong indicator they're trying to stay under the radar.

Putting it together, if they're using these non-standard methods, it's likely they're communicating with their C2 servers before stealing data. Then, they encrypt the stolen data with AES, which is a strong encryption method, making it harder to decrypt later.

So, the answer should be Yes, they do use these non-standard ports and protocols before stealing data and encrypting it.

The analysis indicates that WinDealer likely uses non-standard ports (T1571) and non-standard protocols (T1095) for communication with C2 servers, which helps evade detection. This behavior is consistent with tactics aimed at avoiding security tools and encrypting data post-exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
