Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Higaisa APT group is likely to compromise legitimate web browser updates to install a backdoor after sending malicious LNK files as part of a spear-phishing campaign, specifically using a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs provided are T1566.002 Spearphishing Link and T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain.

First, I need to understand what each TTP means. T1566.002 is about using a spearphishing link, which is a targeted phishing attack, often via email, pretending to be something legitimate like a CV or exam results. T1195.002 refers to compromising a software supply chain, which could involve tampering with updates or patches to gain access to systems.

So, the question is whether Higaisa would use these TTPs to get a backdoor. Let me think about how these TTPs could be used together. Spearphishing would get the initial access, maybe getting an employee to click on a malicious link, which could lead to the installation of malware. Once they have access, they might look for ways to maintain persistence, which could involve compromising the software supply chain, like web browser updates.

Wait, but web browser updates are usually handled by the browser vendor, not the organization's own software. So, if the attacker compromises the software supply chain, maybe they could alter updates to inject malicious code. That way, every time the browser updates, it could download a backdoor. That makes sense because it's a common way to ensure long-term access without needing to reattack.

So, the sequence would be: first, use spearphishing to get initial access, then use compromised software supply chain to update the browser with a backdoor. That fits the question. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The Higaisa APT group is likely to use the provided TTPs. They would start with a spearphishing email to distribute malicious LNK files, which would lead to initial access. Once access is gained, they could compromise the software supply chain, such as web browser updates, to install a backdoor. This sequence aligns with the question's scenario.

Final Answer: A: Yes
