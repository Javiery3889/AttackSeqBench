Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to a C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server via HTTPS and encrypted comms with multi-byte XOR keys. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No, and the related TTPs are T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

First, I need to understand the question. It's about whether the attacker, FamousSparrow, is using scheduled data transfers to exfiltrate data. The question mentions SparrowDoor for communication with the C&C server using HTTPS and multi-byte XOR for encryption. So, the main points are the use of SparrowDoor, HTTPS, XOR encryption, and scheduled data transfer every 10 minutes.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1029 is about scheduled transfer, which fits the part about exfiltration every 10 minutes. T1041 is about exfiltration over a C2 channel, which would be the method of exfiltration. So, the question is combining both TTPs.

Now, the question is whether these two TTPs are used together. The question says that SparrowDoor is used for communication with the C&C server, which is over HTTPS. So, the communication part is covered by SparrowDoor and HTTPS. Then, the exfiltration part is using a scheduled transfer method, which would be T1029, and the exfiltration itself is over the C2 channel, which is T1041.

So, the sequence would be: first, using SparrowDoor to communicate with C&C via HTTPS, then using the C2 channel (from T1041) for exfiltration, and scheduling this to happen every 10 minutes using T1029. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, because both T1029 and T1041 are being used together as part of the attack sequence described.

The question describes a scenario where FamousSparrow uses SparrowDoor for communication with the C&C server via HTTPS and multi-byte XOR encryption. The attacker also exfiltrates data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method. The related TTPs T1029 and T1041 both fit into this sequence: T1029 handles the scheduled transfer, and T1041 is the method of exfiltration over the C2 channel. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final Answer: A
