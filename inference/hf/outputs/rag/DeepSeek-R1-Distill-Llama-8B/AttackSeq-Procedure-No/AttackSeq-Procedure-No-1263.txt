Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Cobalt Strike would empty log files after using lateral movement and process injection on remote computers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that during the discovery phase, Cobalt Strike uses commands like whoami, net user, and net group. These commands are used to gather information about the system, like user accounts and network shares. So, the initial step is about gathering intelligence.

Now, the question is whether they would then empty log files to hide their activities. I know that log file management is a common tactic for evading detection. Techniques like T1070.004, which is about file deletion, would fit here. So, after moving laterally and injecting processes, they might delete logs to cover their tracks.

Looking at the answer choices, A says yes, B says no. The related TTPs include T1018 for discovery and T1070.004 for file deletion. So, it makes sense that after discovering the remote computers, they would move laterally and then delete logs to stay undetected.

The question asks if Cobalt Strike would empty log files after using lateral movement and process injection. The related TTPs include T1018 (remote discovery) and T1070.004 (file deletion). Since log file management is a common evasion tactic, it's logical that after gathering info, they'd delete logs to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
