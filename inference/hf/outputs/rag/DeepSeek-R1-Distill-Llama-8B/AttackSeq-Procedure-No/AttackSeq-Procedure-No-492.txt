Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon would use the FTP protocol for C2 communication after Harvester's screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. The question is about whether these two tools would use FTP for command and control (C2) communication. The options are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two main ones. The first is Tactic: Collection with Technique: T1113-Screen Capture. This makes sense because the question mentions that Harvester's tool captures screenshots, which is a form of data collection. So, the initial step is about gathering information, which aligns with the collection tactic.

The second TTP is Tactic: Command and Control with Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols. This suggests that the attackers are using file transfer protocols for their C2 communication. FTP is one of the protocols listed here, so this indicates that file transfer methods are being used for command and control.

Now, considering the tools mentioned: Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon. Backdoor.Graphon is a custom backdoor, which typically allows for various types of malicious activities, including data exfiltration. Cobalt Strike Beacon is a tool used in attacks for beaconing, which is a method of establishing C2 communication. It's often used to exfiltrate data or receive commands from the attacker's C2 server.

FTP is a file transfer protocol, and it's commonly used for transferring files over a network. However, FTP is known to be insecure because it's unencrypted and doesn't have the same level of security as SFTP or FTPS. Attackers might use it because it's simple and widely available, making it a common choice for C2 communication in some cases.

Putting this together, the question is about whether these tools would use FTP for C2. The related TTPs point towards file transfer being part of the attack, specifically T1071.002, which includes FTP. Since the screenshot tool is already capturing data, the next logical step would be to transfer that data using a file transfer protocol like FTP for exfiltration.

I don't see any direct information that would indicate that these specific tools avoid using FTP. In fact, since T1071.002 is listed as a related TTP, it's more likely that they would use it. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The analysis indicates that the related TTPs suggest the use of file transfer protocols for C2, specifically T1071.002, which includes FTP. Given that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are tools used for malicious activities, including data exfiltration, it's plausible they would utilize FTP for command and control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
