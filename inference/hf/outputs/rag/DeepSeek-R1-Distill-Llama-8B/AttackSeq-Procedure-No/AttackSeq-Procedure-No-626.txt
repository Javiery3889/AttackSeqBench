Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The CostaRicto Campaign is using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with their C2 servers. Protocol tunneling usually means they're establishing a secure way to send data without being detected, maybe using DNS for commands or data transfer. HTTP is another common protocol, so perhaps they're using it for command and control (C2) communication.

Now, the question is about whether SombRAT, a backdoor, will exfiltrate data using HTTPS or SMTPS but through a non-C2 protocol. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. The options are whether the exfiltration uses HTTPS or SMTPS, but via a non-C2 protocol. So, the exfiltration method isn't using the same C2 protocol they used to communicate with the servers.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling. This makes sense because the initial communication is using protocol tunneling, likely over DNS and HTTP, which are both valid for C2.

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This means they're using their C2 channel to exfiltrate data, which would be the same protocol they used for communication, probably HTTP or DNS.

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol. This is interesting because it's using a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration. So, maybe they're using something like HTTPS or SMTPS, which are encrypted, but not their C2 protocol.

Wait, but the question is whether they're using a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration. So, if they're using HTTPS or SMTPS, which are common for encrypted communication, but not their C2 protocol, that would fit T1048.003.

But the initial communication is over HTTP and DNS, which are likely their C2. So, for exfiltration, they might switch to another protocol like HTTPS or SMTPS, which are non-C2, hence using T1048.003.

So, the answer would be yes, they can exfiltrate over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

The CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication. SombRAT, as a backdoor, may exfiltrate data using non-C2 protocols like HTTPS or SMTPS, which aligns with T1048.003.

Final Answer: A: Yes
