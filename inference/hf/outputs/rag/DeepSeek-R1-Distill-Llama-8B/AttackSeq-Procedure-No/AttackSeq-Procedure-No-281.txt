Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the OceanLotus backdoor would survey a victim's computer after establishing command and control using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode. The question is whether it would gather details like the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are T1082 (Discovery) and T1573.001 (Symmetric Cryptography).

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1082 is about system information discovery, which would involve gathering details about the victim's system, like their name or other system info. T1573.001 is about symmetric cryptography, which is used for encrypting communications, so that's about the encryption method used.

The question mentions that the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode. So, the encryption is set up, and the command and control is established. Now, after that, would the backdoor proceed to gather more information?

I know that backdoors often have various functionalities. Some might just provide a reverse shell, others might do more, like key logging, data exfiltration, or information gathering. Since the question is about whether it would survey the system, I'm leaning towards yes because that's a common tactic after establishing access.

The TTPs provided are T1082 and T1573.001. T1082 is directly about gathering system info, so that fits. T1573.001 is about encryption, which is already in place for the command and control, so maybe that's part of the initial setup, but not necessarily part of the surveying phase.

So, putting it together, after establishing C2 using symmetric crypto, the backdoor would likely use T1082 to gather system info. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor would gather system information after establishing command and control using AES in CBC mode. The related TTPs are T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1573.001 (Symmetric Cryptography). 

1. **T1082** is directly related to gathering system information, which aligns with the question's focus on gathering details like the victim's name and system info.
2. **T1573.001** pertains to encryption, which is part of the initial setup but not the surveying phase.
3. Since the backdoor is established, it's plausible it would use T1082 to gather additional information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
