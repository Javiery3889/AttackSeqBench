Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Rising Sun implant was used for initial reconnaissance. It collected system and network details. The question mentions that it used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration. So, the initial data collection phase involved these encryption and encoding methods.

Now, the question is about how the implant communicates with the control server. The options are whether it uses HTTP POST with RC4 and Base64. I remember that RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is commonly used in older protocols like HTTP. Base64 is often used to obfuscate data, making it harder to detect.

Looking at the related TTPs, there's T1132.001-Standard Encoding, which is about using specific encoding techniques. T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is about removing or bypassing these encodings. So, the implant might be using these techniques to communicate.

In the initial phase, the Rising Sun used RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration. It makes sense that for communication, they'd use the same or similar methods to avoid detection. HTTP POST is a common method for sending data, and using RC4 encryption would help secure the data. Obfuscating it with Base64 would make the traffic look like regular HTTP traffic, which is often how attackers avoid detection.

I think the answer is yes because the implant would likely use the same or similar techniques for communication as it did for exfiltration. The related TTPs support the use of encoding and deobfuscation, which fits with using Base64 and RC4.

The Rising Sun implant used RC4 and Base64 during initial data exfiltration, so it's plausible that it would employ the same methods for communication. The related TTPs indicate the use of encoding and deobfuscation techniques, aligning with HTTP POST and RC4 encryption.

Final Answer: A: Yes
