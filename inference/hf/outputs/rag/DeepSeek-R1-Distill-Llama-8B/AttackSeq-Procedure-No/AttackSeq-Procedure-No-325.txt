Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app will execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices after sending data to a C2 server. The question is whether this is likely. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are Exfiltration (T1020) and Discovery (T1057), specifically T1057 being Process Discovery.

First, I need to understand what each TTP does. T1057, Process Discovery, involves identifying and enumerating processes on a system. So the app would first collect a list of processes, which makes sense as part of initial discovery.

Next, T1020 is about Automated Exfiltration, which is sending data out via HTTP. So after collecting the process data, the app would send it out. Now, the question is whether after sending this data, the app would hide its icon and run in the background.

In iOS, apps can hide their icons by not updating their display in the home screen, but they still show up in the background. However, running in the background on iOS typically requires specific permissions. On iOS, only certain apps can run in the background, like those that handle voice calls or music, but other apps usually don't run continuously unless they're actively in use.

So, if the app is sending data via HTTP, it might do so in the background, but whether it can stay hidden is another matter. Hiding the icon might make it less noticeable, but running in the background on iOS 7 might not be feasible for a general app unless it's using some specific API or exploit.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's likely. Since the app is using T1057 and T1020, which are both about discovery and exfiltration, the next step would be to send the data. After that, the app might want to avoid detection, so hiding the icon and running in the background makes sense to stay undetected. But on iOS, apps can't typically run in the background unless they're using some background processing, which might require specific capabilities.

However, the question is about whether it's likely. Since the app is using these TTPs, it's probably trying to stay hidden, so hiding the icon and running in the background is a plausible next step. But I'm a bit unsure because iOS has restrictions. Maybe the app can't run in the background, so it might not do that. Alternatively, maybe it can, especially if it's using some background services.

Wait, but the question is about the sequence: after collecting processes and sending data, does it execute these steps. So the app would first collect processes (T1057), then send data (T1020), and then hide and run in the background. So the answer would be Yes, it's likely.
</think>

The app would first collect process information (T1057) and then exfiltrate data (T1020). After sending the data, hiding the icon and running in the background is a logical step to avoid detection, making the answer Yes.

Final Answer: A
