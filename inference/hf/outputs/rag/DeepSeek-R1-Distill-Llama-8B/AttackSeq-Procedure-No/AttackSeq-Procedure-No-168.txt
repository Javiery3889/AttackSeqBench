Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SkinnyBoy is likely to obfuscate C2 traffic using an altered version of base64 before communicating with the C2 server updaterweb.com via an HTTP POST request. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question is about command and control (C2) processes. SkinnyBoy is using an HTTP POST request to a domain called updaterweb.com. The main point is whether he's using an altered base64 encoding for this communication.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two: T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1132.001-Standard Encoding. Let me recall what each of these means.

T1071.001 is about using web protocols for command and control. This makes sense because HTTP and HTTPS are common for C2 because they're widely used and often go undetected. So, using HTTP POST is a typical method for sending data to a server.

Now, T1132.001 refers to standard encoding techniques. Base64 is a common encoding method used to transfer data, especially in environments where text isn't the primary data type. It's often used to embed binary data within text, which can help avoid detection because it looks like normal traffic.

So, putting this together, SkinnyBoy is using HTTP POST, which is a web protocol (T1071.001), and base64 encoding, which is a standard encoding technique (T1132.001). Therefore, it's likely that he's using both of these techniques together to communicate with his C2 server.

I don't see any conflicting information in the related TTPs that would suggest he's using a different encoding method or a different protocol. The question specifically mentions base64, so that aligns with T1132.001. Therefore, the answer should be yes, he is obfuscating the traffic with an altered base64.

The analysis indicates that SkinnyBoy is using both T1071.001 (HTTP POST) and T1132.001 (base64 encoding) for his C2 communication, making the use of altered base64 likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
