Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a campaign that uses obfuscation for a backdoor payload would drop components like invoker.ps1 after the initial access, which is achieved by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts in a Microsoft Word document and executing them via macro-triggered events. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The question is about defense evasion tactics. The campaign is using obfuscation, which is a defense evasion technique. Obfuscation makes it harder for defenders to identify malicious code. So, the initial step is embedding encoded PowerShell scripts in a document, which is a common method for delivering malicious code because it's a common file type and can execute macros.

When the document is opened, the macros are triggered, which then execute the encoded PowerShell scripts. These scripts are probably using some kind of obfuscation technique to avoid detection. Once the initial access is gained, the next step is whether the campaign would drop components like invoker.ps1. Invoker.ps1 is a known PowerShell script that can be used to execute other scripts, often as part of a backdoor or persistence mechanism.

So, the question is whether this happens after the initial access. The related TTPs include T1059.001-PowerShell, which is about using PowerShell for command and control. T1027.010 is command obfuscation, and T1140 is deobfuscate/decode files or information. Wait, T1140 is actually about deobfuscating, but in this case, the initial step is encoding, not deobfuscating. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question says the payload is a backdoor that's been obfuscated. So, the initial step is encoding the payload, which is a defense evasion technique. Then, after the initial access, they might drop invoker.ps1, which is a tool that can help maintain persistence or execute further commands.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this dropping of invoker.ps1 happens after the initial access. So, the sequence would be: encode the payload, embed it in a document, execute via macro, then drop invoker.ps1 for persistence.

The related TTPs include T1027.010, which is about command obfuscation, and T1140, which is deobfuscate. But the question is about encoding, so maybe T1027.010 is about obfuscating the command, not the payload. Wait, no, T1027.010 is about obfuscating files or information, which could include the payload.

Wait, the initial step is encoding the payload, which is a form of defense evasion. Then, after that, they might deobfuscate it when it's time to execute it. But in this case, the question is about dropping invoker.ps1 after initial access, which is part of the execution phase.

So, the sequence is: encode the payload, embed in document, execute via macro, then drop invoker.ps1 for persistence. So, the answer would be yes, because after initial access, they would drop components like invoker.ps1.

But wait, the related TTPs include T1140, which is deobfuscate/decode. So, maybe after the initial access, they need to decode the payload, but the question is about dropping a component, not decoding. So, perhaps the answer is yes, because after initial access, they would execute the payload and then drop invoker.ps1.

Alternatively, maybe the dropping of invoker.ps1 is part of the initial phase, but the question says it's after initial access. So, I think the answer is yes, because after the initial access, they would need to execute the payload and then use invoker.ps1 for persistence.
</think>

The campaign uses obfuscation for the backdoor payload as a defense evasion technique. The initial step involves embedding encoded PowerShell scripts in a Microsoft Word document, which are triggered by macros upon opening the document. After gaining initial access, the campaign would execute these scripts, likely requiring the use of invoker.ps1 to handle the execution and possibly maintain persistence. The related TTPs support this sequence, indicating that dropping invoker.ps1 is a plausible next step after initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
