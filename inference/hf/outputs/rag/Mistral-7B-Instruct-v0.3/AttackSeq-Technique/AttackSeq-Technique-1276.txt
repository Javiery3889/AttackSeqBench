 Final Answer: B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique used to transfer exfiltrated data over the network.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Reconnaissance (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service) and the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
3. Spearphishing Service (T1598.001) is a technique used to gather information for further attacks, but it does not directly involve data transfer over the network.
4. Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) is a technique used to transfer data to a command and control server, but it does not specify the method of transfer over the web.
5. Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567) is a technique used to transfer data to a remote server over the web, which aligns with the scenario where the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool needs to be sent to a remote server.
6. Phishing (T1566) is a technique used to trick victims into providing sensitive information, but it does not directly involve data transfer over the network.
7. Exfiltration over USB (T1052.001) is a technique used to transfer data by physically connecting a USB device to a compromised system, which does not seem to be the case in the scenario described.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1598.001-Spearphishing Service (Reconnaissance) to gather information for further attacks.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Exfiltration) to transfer the exfiltrated data to a command and control server.
- T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service (Exfiltration) to transfer the data from the command and control server to a remote server over the web.
