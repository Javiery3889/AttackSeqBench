 Final Answer: T1553.002-Code Signing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors. The question also mentions that stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server through legitimate tools to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Exfiltration (Tactic) and Defense Evasion (Tactic). The Exfiltration techniques mentioned are Automated Exfiltration (T1020) and Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003). The Defense Evasion technique mentioned is Code Signing (T1553.002).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1555-Credentials from Password Stores does not directly relate to the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.
   - T1036-Masquerading involves impersonating a user or system, but it does not necessarily involve the use of legitimate tools or scripts to evade detection.
   - T1078-Valid Accounts involves using valid accounts to gain access, but it does not directly relate to the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.
   - T1553.002-Code Signing involves using legitimate tools (code signing tools) to sign malicious files, making them appear harmless and evading detection by behavior-based detectors. This technique aligns best with the question as it involves the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection, and it is related to the Exfiltration of stolen credentials.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Exfiltration and Defense Evasion.
   - T1553.002-Code Signing involves using legitimate tools (code signing tools) to sign malicious files, making them appear harmless and evading detection by behavior-based detectors. This technique aligns best with the question as it involves the use of legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection, and it is related to the Exfiltration of stolen credentials.
   - Final Answer: T1553.002-Code Signing.
