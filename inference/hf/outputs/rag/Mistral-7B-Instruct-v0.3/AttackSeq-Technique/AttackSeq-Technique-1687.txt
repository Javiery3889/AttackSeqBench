 Final Answer: B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan established communications with a C&C server.
2. The related TTPs indicate that lateral movement has occurred (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer), and the attacker used compromised credentials to access servers (T1552.008-Chat Messages). This suggests that the attacker has already moved laterally within the network and gained access to the servers.
3. The PoisonIvy Trojan is a remote access Trojan that communicates with a C&C server. To maintain communication with the C&C server, the attacker would likely use multi-stage channels to evade detection.
4. The answer choices do not directly relate to the establishment of communication between the PoisonIvy Trojan and the C&C server. Services registry permissions weakness (A: T1574.011) and non-standard port usage (C: T1571) are not directly related to communication with a C&C server. Using alternate authentication material (D: T1550) is more likely related to initial access or maintaining access to a system, not communication with a C&C server.
5. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, as it best aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, where the attacker has moved laterally, gained access to the servers, and established communication with the PoisonIvy Trojan using multi-stage channels to evade detection.
