 Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. After TDrop2 evaded detection through process hollowing and disguised payload retrieval (T1055.012), it is likely that the malware would want to gather details about the infected system to further its objectives.
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion techniques like T1055.012 are used to avoid detection, but they do not inherently provide system information.
3. T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is a technique used to avoid detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments, which is not directly related to system information gathering.
4. T1560.002-Archive via Library is a technique used to store data in a library, which is not directly related to system information gathering after defense evasion.
5. T1106-Native API is a technique used to execute commands and scripts using built-in operating system functions, but it is not directly related to system information gathering after defense evasion.
6. T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the system, which aligns best with the malware's need to gather details about the infected system after successfully evading detection.
