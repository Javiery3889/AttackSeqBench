 Final Answer: D: T1102-User Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled the execution of the embedded downloader macro to install the backdoor.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence, specifically T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, which is a technique used for maintaining persistence on a compromised system.
3. However, the question does not ask for a persistence technique but rather a technique that would enable the execution of the macro.
4. T1102-User Execution is a technique that involves tricking a user into running a malicious file, which aligns with the execution of the embedded downloader macro.
5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the execution of the macro, making them less plausible.
6. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: T1102-User Execution.
