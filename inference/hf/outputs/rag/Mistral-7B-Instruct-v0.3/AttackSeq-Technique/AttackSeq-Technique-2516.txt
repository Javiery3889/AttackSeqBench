 Final Answer: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that GreyEnergy has compromised a computer and obtained domain administrator privileges using Nmap and Mimikatz. This sequence of events aligns with T1078-Credential Dumping and T1087-OS Credential Dumping techniques.

2. The question then states that GreyEnergy performed lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe. This action is related to the Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.

3. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool, and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts, are not directly related to the lateral movement phase.

4. Tactic: Remote Services (T1021) and Tactic: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription (T1546.003) are not mentioned in the question or related TTPs, so they can be ruled out.

5. Tactic: Internal Spearphishing (T1546) is not related to the lateral movement phase or the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1078-Credential Dumping (Obtaining domain administrator privileges)
- T1087-OS Credential Dumping (Obtaining domain administrator privileges)
- T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (Lateral movement using PsExec and WinExe)
