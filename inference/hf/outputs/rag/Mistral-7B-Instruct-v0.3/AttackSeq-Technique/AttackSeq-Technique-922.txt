 Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Volatile Cedar has conducted vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers, which aligns with the Reconnaissance Tactic and T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning technique.
2. The question also mentions that Volatile Cedar will use the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components, but this action is not directly related to the initial access into the network.
3. The related TTPs provided in the question point towards the Initial Access Tactic, which involves techniques used to gain access to a system.
4. Among the answer choices, only T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application directly relates to the Initial Access Tactic, as it involves exploiting publicly-facing applications to gain access to a system. This technique could have been used after the vulnerability scans to exploit the identified web servers, allowing Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network.
5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the Initial Access Tactic or the context provided in the question. T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is more about exploiting services running on a system, not gaining initial access. T1480.001-Environmental Keying and T1091-Replication Through Removable Media are techniques related to lateral movement or data exfiltration, not initial access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning (Reconnaissance) to identify exploitable web servers.
- T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (Initial Access) to exploit the identified web servers and gain access to the target network.
