 Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a VBA macro using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL. This action falls under the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter. However, T1059 does not provide continuous execution of malicious code.

2. The question then asks for the technique that ensures continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

3. From the related TTPs, we can see that T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job is related to the Execution tactic and is used to schedule the execution of a task or job at a specific time.

4. The other answer choices do not provide a mechanism for continuous execution of malicious code at specific intervals. T1565-Data Manipulation and T1566-Phishing are not related to the continuous execution of malicious code, and T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL is a technique used for lateral movement, not for ensuring continuous execution.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1059.005 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) to execute the VBA macro and download the dropper VBScript.
- After the dropper is downloaded, T1053.001 (Task Scheduled) is used to schedule the malicious VBScript to run every two hours. This would ensure the continuous execution of the malicious code.
