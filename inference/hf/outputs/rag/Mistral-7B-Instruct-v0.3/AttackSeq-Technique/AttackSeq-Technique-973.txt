 Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred during the Collection phase, given that the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
2. The related TTPs provided (T1082-System Information Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery) are both Discovery techniques, which suggests that the attacker is still in the Discovery phase, gathering information about the system.
3. However, the Collection phase is about gathering data for further use, and the information gathered during Discovery can be used in the Collection phase.
4. Among the answer choices, T1113-Screen Capture and T1056-Input Capture are techniques used for data collection but are not directly related to the system information gathered during the Discovery phase. T1564.002-Hidden Users is a technique used for maintaining persistence, not for data collection.
5. T1057-Process Discovery is a technique used to gather information about running processes on a system, which can be useful for the attacker to identify valuable data sources or to find processes related to security tools that could potentially interfere with their activities.
6. Therefore, T1057-Process Discovery is the most plausible technique that occurred during the Collection phase, following the Discovery phase where the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information.
