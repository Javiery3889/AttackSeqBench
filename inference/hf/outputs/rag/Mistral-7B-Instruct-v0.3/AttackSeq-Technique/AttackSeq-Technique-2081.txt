 Final Answer: T1059.001-PowerShell

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
2. The related TTPs mention the use of malvertising (T1583.008) and PowerShell (T1059.001) in the attack sequence.
3. Since the PowerShell script is mentioned as the initial step after the RIG exploit, it is reasonable to assume that the PowerShell technique (T1059.001) was used to execute the script and download the malware.
4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the execution of the PowerShell script or the downloading of malware, so they can be ruled out.
5. Serverless Execution (T1648) and Obtain Capabilities (T1588) are techniques that are typically used after the initial execution of malware, not during the initial execution phase.
6. DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) is a technique used to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or the downloading of malware.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1583.008-Malvertising (Redirect users to compromised sites)
- T1059.001-PowerShell (Execute obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware)
- (Other TTPs related to the malware execution and post-exploitation)
