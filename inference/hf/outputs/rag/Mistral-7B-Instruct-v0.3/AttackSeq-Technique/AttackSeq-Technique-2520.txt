 Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attackers performed discovery activities on system and network information after exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities. This indicates that the attackers are gathering information about the system and network to further their attack.
2. The related TTPs mention the Credential Access tactic, but the question asks for a technique that occurred before the attackers secured sensitive victim credentials. Therefore, T1003-OS Credential Dumping, T1187-Forced Authentication, and T1547.014-Active Setup, which are all Credential Access techniques, can be ruled out as they would likely occur after the discovery phase and before the credential dumping phase.
3. The remaining answer choice, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, is a Discovery technique that involves gathering information about the system's network configuration. This technique could be used to discover additional vulnerabilities, identify potential targets, or map the network layout, all of which are common activities that occur during the discovery phase of an attack.
4. Since the question asks for a technique that most likely occurred after the discovery activities on system and network information but before the attackers secured sensitive victim credentials, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is the most plausible answer.
