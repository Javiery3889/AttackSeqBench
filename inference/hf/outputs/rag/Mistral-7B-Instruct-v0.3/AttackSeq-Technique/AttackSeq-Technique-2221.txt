 Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, gathering network configuration and domain information. This indicates that they have already performed some form of Initial Access (Tactic) to gain knowledge about the target network.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566-Phishing, which is a method used for gaining Initial Access. However, it is not the technique mentioned in the question as it is the step that occurred after the reconnaissance but before the active scanning.
3. The answer choices provided are all related to Initial Access or maintaining access to a system. Among these, T1595-Active Scanning is the technique that best fits the sequence of events described in the question. Active scanning is a technique used to discover hosts and services on a network, which could be a logical step after reconnaissance to identify potential targets for spear phishing emails.
4. T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal, T1596.003-Digital Certificates, and T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism are techniques that are more likely to be used after gaining initial access to a system, either to maintain access or to escalate privileges, rather than before sending spear phishing emails.
