 Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic is involved, and more specifically, the technique T1566-Phishing is mentioned.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information is about collecting information about the victim's host, which typically happens after initial access has been gained.
   - C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is about collecting information about the victim's network, which typically happens after initial access has been gained.
   - D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material is about using non-standard authentication methods, which is not directly related to the initial access phase.
   - B: T1566-Phishing is about delivering a phishing attachment, which aligns best with the scenario described in the question, as it is the method used to send the spear phishing emails that exploited Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance. This technique can lead to initial access when the victim opens the OLE2 format attachments.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566-Phishing (delivering a phishing attachment) -> T1192-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance) -> T1078-Initial Access (gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments).
