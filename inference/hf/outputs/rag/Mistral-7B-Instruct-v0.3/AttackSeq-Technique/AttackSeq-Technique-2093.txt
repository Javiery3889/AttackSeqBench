 Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers have moved laterally across the infrastructure, which aligns with the Tactic: Lateral Movement. The Related TTPs also indicate Lateral Movement (T1570).
2. The attackers have compromised numerous workstations and targeted internal hosts and servers during their search for critical information. This suggests a Collection Tactic, as they are gathering data. The Related TTPs also indicate Collection (T1005).
3. Among the answer choices, T1562.006-Indicator Blocking and T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing do not seem to fit the context of the question, as they do not involve data collection or searching for critical information.
4. T1003-OS Credential Dumping could be a possible answer, as it involves gathering credentials, but it is more commonly associated with initial access or maintaining access rather than searching for critical information.
5. T1213-Data from Information Repositories is the most plausible answer, as it involves the collection of data from information repositories, which aligns with the attackers searching for critical information in internal hosts and servers.
