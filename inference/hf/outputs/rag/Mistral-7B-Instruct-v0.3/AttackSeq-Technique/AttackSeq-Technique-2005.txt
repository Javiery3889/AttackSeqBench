 Final Answer: B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the KopiLuwak backdoor began communicating with compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands. This suggests a Command and Control (C2) communication, which is a common technique for remote management of compromised systems.

2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control and the Technique T1102-Web Service. However, the question specifies that the backdoor is communicating with compromised websites, not a web service.

3. The related TTPs also mention T1102.003-One-Way Communication, which could suggest a one-way communication channel, but it doesn't specify the method of this communication.

4. The Tactic of Exfiltration and Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel are also related, but they don't directly answer the question about the initial C2 communication method.

5. The Tactic of Command and Control and Technique T1572-Protocol Tunneling are also related, and this technique is often used to create a covert channel for C2 communication. It can involve using a legitimate protocol to hide malicious traffic, which aligns with the question's description of the backdoor communicating with compromised websites.

6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial compromise (T1078)
   - Initial access (T1087)
   - Command and Control (T1059)
   - Protocol Tunneling (T1572) for C2 communication
   - Exfiltration (T1041) over the established C2 channel.

7. However, the question asks specifically about the TTP that occurred when the backdoor began communicating with compromised websites, so the answer is T1572-Protocol Tunneling.
