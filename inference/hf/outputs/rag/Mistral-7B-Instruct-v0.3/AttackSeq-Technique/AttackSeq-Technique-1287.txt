 Final Answer: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Tropic Trooper leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Command and Control and the use of non-standard ports.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service is a technique used to deliver malicious content, not directly related to establishing a secure connection to a C&C server.
   - B: T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to establish a secure connection, which could be a prerequisite for using custom SSL libraries.
   - C: T1001.002-Steganography is a technique used to hide the existence of a communication channel or data within an unrelated or normal data, not directly related to establishing a secure connection.
   - D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools is a technique used to install or update software on a target system, not directly related to establishing a secure connection to a C&C server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: First, Tropic Trooper would have used T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation to disguise their connection as a legitimate service. Then, they would have used T1573-Encrypted Channel to secure the connection before leveraging custom SSL libraries (T1571.001-Web Protocols) to connect to the C&C server. Therefore, the answer is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
