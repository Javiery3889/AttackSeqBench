 Final Answer: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before StellarParticle demonstrated persistence using credential hopping and creating new O365 Service Principals.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used Credential Access (T1555) to obtain credentials from web browsers (T1555.003).
3. The TTP T1078.004-Cloud Accounts is related to persistence, but it is not the initial technique used to gain access to the credentials.
4. T1136-Create Account, T1078.002-Domain Accounts, and T1560.002-Archive via Library are not directly related to the initial access of web browser credentials.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers (initial access to the stolen credentials) followed by T1078.004-Cloud Accounts (persistent access using the stolen credentials to create new O365 Service Principals).
