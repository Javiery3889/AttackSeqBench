 Final Answer: C: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware established persistence through a hidden 'autoupdater' module, which suggests the use of a long-term, stealthy technique to maintain access to the compromised system. This aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion.

2. The malware is using a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic to remain undetected, which is a common tactic used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Lazarus to blend in with normal network traffic. This aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion and Tactic: Command and Control.

3. The related TTP T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location suggests that the malware is using a legitimate name or location to blend in, which is a common technique for Defense Evasion.

4. The related TTP T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation suggests that the malware is using a protocol or service that is commonly used for legitimate purposes, but is being manipulated for malicious activities, which is a common technique for Command and Control.

5. The related TTP T1587.001-Malware indicates the use of malware, which is a common tool for APT groups like Lazarus.

6. Among the answer choices, T1657-Financial Theft does not directly relate to the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic. T1055.012-Process Hollowing is a technique for executing malicious code within a legitimate process, but it does not necessarily imply the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic. T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software is a technique for hiding malware within legitimate software, which aligns with the use of a legitimate-looking application. D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is a technique for making malware harder to analyze, but it does not necessarily imply the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (Defense Evasion)
   - T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation (Command and Control)
   - T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software (Resource Development)
