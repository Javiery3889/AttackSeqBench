 Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that GreyEnergy operators first compromised public-facing web servers (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) for initial access.
2. After initial access, they used spearphishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to gain further access or compromise additional systems.
3. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before deploying modular malware functionalities.
4. Deploying modular malware functionalities is not directly related to T1087.001-Local Account (creating a local account), T1587-Develop Capabilities (building custom tools), or T1585.003-Cloud Accounts (exfiltrating data from cloud resources).
5. T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is a technique that involves exploiting known vulnerabilities in remote services, which could lead to the deployment of malware on the compromised system, making it a plausible step before deploying modular malware functionalities.
6. Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs would be: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application > T1566.002-Spearphishing Link > T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services > Deploy modular malware functionalities.
