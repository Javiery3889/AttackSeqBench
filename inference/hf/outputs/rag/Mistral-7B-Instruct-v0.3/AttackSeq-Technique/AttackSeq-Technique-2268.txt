 Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already exfiltrated the email accounts (T1020) and the tactic is Exfiltration.
3. T1090.001 (Internal Proxy) is not directly related to communication with external domains for downloading malware or sending data.
4. T1546.013 (PowerShell Profile) is about using PowerShell profiles for initial access or persistence, not for communication with external domains.
5. T1114 (Email Collection) is about collecting email content, not about communication with domains for malware download or data exfiltration.
6. T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is about using application layer protocols for exfiltration, which aligns with the question's context of communicating with domains for malware download and data exfiltration.
7. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
