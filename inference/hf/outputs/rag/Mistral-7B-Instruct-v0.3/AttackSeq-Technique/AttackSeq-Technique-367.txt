 Final Answer: T1018-Remote System Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN8 performed domain trust discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Discovery tactic, specifically Domain Trust Discovery (T1482). However, it also suggests that Remote System Discovery (T1018) might be relevant since the question mentions system fingerprinting using commands like systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe, which are often used for remote system discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1069.001-Local Groups: This technique involves querying the local groups of a system, which doesn't seem to be directly related to system fingerprinting or domain trust discovery.
   - T1587.003-Digital Certificates: This technique involves using digital certificates for lateral movement or command and control, which doesn't seem to be related to the initial system discovery or domain trust discovery.
   - T1553-Subvert Trust Controls: This technique involves manipulating trust relationships to bypass security controls, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the initial system discovery or domain trust discovery.
   - T1033-System Owner/User Discovery: This technique involves discovering system or user information, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to system fingerprinting or domain trust discovery, especially since the question mentions commands like systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe, which are not typically used for user discovery.

4. T1018-Remote System Discovery seems to be the most plausible sequence of TTPs before FIN8 performed domain trust discovery (T1482). System fingerprinting using commands like systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe is a common method for remote system discovery, and once the attacker has identified the system, they may proceed to discover domain trust relationships (T1482).
