 Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the PowerShell script executed a new script leading to the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using PowerShell (T1059.001) and Defense Evasion (T1140).
3. T1008-Fallback Channels is a technique used to establish alternative command and control (C2) channels to maintain communication with the compromised system, which aligns with the establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool.
4. T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique used to communicate over application layer protocols, but it doesn't necessarily follow the execution of a new script leading to the establishment of a remote access tool.
5. T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography is a technique used for encryption and decryption, but it doesn't directly relate to the establishment of a remote access tool.
6. T1129-Shared Modules is a technique used to share code between multiple stages of an attack, but it doesn't necessarily follow the execution of a new script leading to the establishment of a remote access tool.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1059.001 (PowerShell script decrypts and executes a new script) -> T1140 (Deobfuscation to hide the new script) -> T1008 (Establishing a fallback channel for C2 communication, which is necessary for the remote access tool to function).
