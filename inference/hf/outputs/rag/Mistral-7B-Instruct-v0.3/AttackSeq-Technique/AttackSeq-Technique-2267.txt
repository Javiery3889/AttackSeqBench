 Final Answer: T1056-Input Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware accessed Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather contacts' email accounts and before the collected email accounts were exfiltrated via a POST web request.

2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker is collecting email accounts (T1114-Email Collection) and specifically, collecting email accounts locally (T1114.001-Local Email Collection) and forwarding them (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule).

3. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is about setting up a program to run automatically at system startup, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

4. T1137.004-Outlook Home Page is about modifying the Outlook home page, which also doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

5. T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies is about manipulating conditional access policies to bypass security controls, which is not a step in the sequence of events described in the question.

6. T1056-Input Capture, on the other hand, is about capturing keystrokes or screen input, which could be used to automate the process of sending emails using the collected email accounts. This technique seems to fit well in the sequence of events described in the question, as it could be used to automate the process of sending emails (the next step before exfiltration) using the collected email accounts.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1114-Email Collection (malware accessed Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather contacts' email accounts), T1056-Input Capture (to automate the process of sending emails), and T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule or T1114.001-Local Email Collection (to collect email accounts for use in impersonation through BEC attacks), and finally T1041-Exfiltration Over Command and Control (to exfiltrate the collected email accounts via a POST web request).
