 Final Answer: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Command and Control (Tactic) and the use of Non-Standard Port (T1571) and Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to establish a secure communication channel, which could be a prerequisite for further communication with a C2 server.
   - T1568.003-DNS Calculation is a technique used to perform DNS-based exfiltration or command and control, but it doesn't necessarily have to precede the establishment of an encrypted channel.
   - T1123-Audio Capture is not related to establishing a communication channel or command and control.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique used to exfiltrate data after it has been collected, not to establish a communication channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: First, the attacker would establish an encrypted channel (T1573) to ensure secure communication. Then, they would use this channel to communicate with the C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port (as stated in the question). This is supported by the related TTPs T1571 (Non-Standard Port) and T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol), which suggest the use of a non-standard communication method. Therefore, the final answer is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
