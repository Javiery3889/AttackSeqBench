 Final Answer: B: T1125-Video Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that likely enabled the capture of webcam images as part of the RAT's core functionality.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the Tactic involved is Collection, and the Technique is T1125-Video Capture.
3. Analyzing the answer choices, we find that T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, T1608.002-Upload Tool, and T1213.002-Sharepoint are not directly related to the capture of webcam images.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Adwind RAT employs multi-layer obfuscation techniques (T1564.001-Obfuscated Files or Information) to evade detection.
   - After successful evasion, it captures webcam images as part of its core functionality (T1125-Video Capture).
   - Finally, it attempts to connect to its command and control server (T1071-Command and Control).
5. However, the question asks for the technique that enabled the capture of webcam images, so the direct answer is T1125-Video Capture.
