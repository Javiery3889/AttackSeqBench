 Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Initial Access (Tactic) through exploiting a Public-Facing Application (T1190) and the use of a Web Shell (T1505.003) for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1596.004-CDNs is not directly related to the initial access phase. It is more related to data exfiltration or command and control.
   - B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection is a technique used for persistence, not for initial access.
   - C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is a technique used for delivering tools or malware to the target system, which could be used to establish initial access before exploiting a vulnerability.
   - D: T1133-External Remote Services is a technique for initial access, but it is not specific to exploiting a Public-Facing Application. T1133 is more general and could involve various methods of remote access. However, T1105 is more directly related to the specific context of exploiting a Public-Facing Application as mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack starts with Initial Access (Tactic) through exploiting a Public-Facing Application (T1190). To achieve this, the attacker needs to deliver the exploit to the target system. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is a technique used for delivering tools or malware to the target system, making it the most plausible technique that occurred before FIN13 established initial access. After delivering the exploit, FIN13 could then use it to gain initial access to the victim network. Once they have access, they could set up a Web Shell (T1505.003) for persistence.
