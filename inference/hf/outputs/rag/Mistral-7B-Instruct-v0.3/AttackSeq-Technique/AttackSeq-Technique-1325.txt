 Final Answer: T1086-PowerShell

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: CosmicDuke, a known advanced persistent threat (APT), is conducting discovery by searching for specific files on hard drives and network drives. The search includes non-English filenames, indicating a broad scope. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred next to gather information from the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which is a technique used to discover files and directories on a system. However, the question asks for a technique that occurs after file discovery, not during.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The remaining answer choices are T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, T1115-Clipboard Data, T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions, and T1113-Screen Capture. T1053 is used to create or modify system services, which is not directly related to gathering information from the system after discovery. T1115 is about exfiltrating data via the clipboard, which is not typically the next step after discovery. T1547.006 involves manipulating kernel modules and extensions, which is more related to maintaining persistence or evading detection, not gathering information. T1113-Screen Capture could potentially be used to gather information, but it's not directly related to the discovery of specific files with non-English filenames.

4. PowerShell (T1086) is a versatile scripting language that can be used for various tasks, including executing commands, automating system tasks, and gathering system information. Given the context of the question, it's plausible that CosmicDuke would use PowerShell to gather information from the system after discovering files with specific patterns, including non-English filenames. Therefore, the most likely answer is T1086-PowerShell.
