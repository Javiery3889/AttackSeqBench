 Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic and the specific technique T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, which involves two-way communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
3. Among the answer choices, T1102-Web Service is the technique that best aligns with the question and the related TTPs. This technique involves the use of web services for command and control, which could include communication through Pastebin or Google+.
4. T1552.001-Credentials In Files, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, and T1001.002-Steganography are techniques that do not directly facilitate communication with C2 servers. T1552.001 is about storing credentials in files, T1027 is about obfuscating files or information, and T1001.002 is about hiding data within other data (steganography).
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1552.001 (if the malware uses credentials stored in files) or T1027 (if the malware uses obfuscated files) to evade detection upon being loaded onto victim machines.
   - T1102-Web Service to facilitate the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.
