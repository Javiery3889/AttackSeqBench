 Final Answer: T1113-Screen Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks before initiating communication with C&C servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves techniques related to Collection (Tactic) and specifically mentions T1113-Screen Capture and T1056.004-Credential API Hooking.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1056.001-Keylogging is a technique for logging keystrokes, not for capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
   - T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is a technique for transferring data out of the compromised system, not for capturing data from desktop applications.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is a technique for executing commands or scripts on the compromised system, not for capturing data from desktop applications.
   - T1113-Screen Capture, on the other hand, is a technique for capturing the screen, which could include data from desktop applications. The use of global Windows hooks (mentioned in the question) is a method often used in conjunction with T1113 to capture data from specific applications.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves techniques related to Collection (Tactic) and specifically mentions T1113-Screen Capture and T1056.004-Credential API Hooking.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the technique that, when used with global Windows hooks, can capture data from desktop applications, making it the most plausible answer in the given sequence of events.
