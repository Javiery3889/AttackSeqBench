 Final Answer: B: T1571-Non-Standard Port

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives, and then establishes encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Command and Control, and specifically mentions the use of Non-Standard Ports (T1571).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1608-Stage Capabilities is about deploying and executing malware stages, but it doesn't directly involve establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers.
   - B: T1571-Non-Standard Port is about using non-standard ports for command and control communication, which aligns with the question as Korplug is establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is about modifying the flow of a running process to execute unintended code, but it doesn't directly involve establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - D: T1090.002-External Proxy is about using external proxy services for command and control, but it doesn't mention the use of a custom TCP-based protocol.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurs after Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives and establishes encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Command and Control, and specifically mentions the use of Non-Standard Ports (T1571).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     - T1087.001-Initial Access (Korplug gains access to the system)
     - T1053.003-Data from Local System (Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives)
     - T1571-Non-Standard Port (Korplug establishes encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol)
