 Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the tactics involved are Exfiltration and the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is mentioned.
3. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique where data is exfiltrated from the compromised system to the command and control server. This technique is often used for transferring stolen data, which aligns with the action of uploading harvested documents.
4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the action of uploading data to a C&C server. T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is about limiting the size of data transfers, T1137.006-Add-ins is about using Office macros or add-ins for initial access, and T1106-Native API is about executing code using built-in operating system functions.
5. Therefore, based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
