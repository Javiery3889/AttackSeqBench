 Final Answer: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled BlackEnergy to evolve with capabilities such as defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows for further evasion of detection.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion, which is relevant to techniques that help an attacker avoid detection.
3. Among the answer choices, T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is the technique that best aligns with the question. This technique involves an attacker using legitimate system mechanisms to elevate privileges, which can include bypassing code signing requirements, as mentioned in the related TTP T1553.006-Code Signing Policy Modification.
4. T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, T1078.003-Local Accounts, and T1518-Software Discovery are not directly related to bypassing code signing requirements or evading detection, making them less plausible choices for the question.
