 Final Answer: T1137.006-Add-ins

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections, including plink.exe for RDP access over SSH. This suggests that the attackers have already established a foothold in the network and have a means of remote access.

2. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling, indicate that the attackers might be using some form of protocol tunneling for command and control communication.

3. The Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH, also provided, suggests that the attackers might be using SSH for lateral movement within the network. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred after the backdoor connection was established, and SSH could have been used earlier for the initial access or for maintaining the backdoor connection.

4. Among the answer choices, T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance and T1202-Indirect Command Execution do not seem to be directly related to the scenario described. T1072-Software Deployment Tools could be a possibility, but it is not as plausible as T1137.006-Add-ins. T1137.006 involves the use of add-ins or macros to execute malicious code, which could be used after the attackers have established a backdoor connection to further their access and move laterally within the network. This aligns best with the scenario described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1572.001-Protocol Tunneling (for command and control communication)
- T1021.004-SSH (for maintaining backdoor connections and initial access)
- T1137.006-Add-ins (for further access and lateral movement within the network)
