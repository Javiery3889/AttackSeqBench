 Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that APT-TOCS established secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs. This indicates that the attackers are using a web protocol for communication, which aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels mentioned in the Related TTPs.

2. The question also mentions that the attackers used multi-beacon communication for evasion and downloaded Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell. This suggests that the attackers are using multiple points of contact and scripting interpreters to execute their malicious code, which aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

3. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after the downloading of Shellcode script functionalities and the maintenance of multi-beacon communication. The use of HTTP GET requests for communication implies that the attackers are encrypting their communication to avoid detection, which aligns with the Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel.

4. While T1654-Log Enumeration and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography could be potential techniques used in the attack, they do not directly follow the sequence of events mentioned in the question. T1654-Log Enumeration is typically used to gather information about system logs, while T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography is a sub-technique of T1573-Encrypted Channel and would likely be used during the initial setup of the encrypted channel. Therefore, D: T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the downloading of Shellcode script functionalities and the maintenance of multi-beacon communication.
