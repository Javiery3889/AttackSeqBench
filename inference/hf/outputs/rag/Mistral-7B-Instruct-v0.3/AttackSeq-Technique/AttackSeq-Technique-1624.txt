 Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that APT28 likely used for secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying a backdoor.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer), bidirectional communication (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication), and fallback channels (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels). This suggests that the attackers are using a secure method for communication and data transfer.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1569-System Services: This technique involves modifying system services for execution, but it does not directly facilitate secure communication.
   - B: T1071.001-Web Protocols: While web protocols can be used for communication, they do not necessarily imply secure communication, especially in the context of APT attacks which often involve evading detection.
   - D: T1218.014-MMC: This technique involves using MMC (Microsoft Management Console) for privilege escalation, but it does not facilitate secure communication.
   - C: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using an encrypted channel for command and control, which aligns with the bidirectional communication and fallback channels mentioned in the related TTPs, making it the most plausible answer.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique used by APT28 for secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
