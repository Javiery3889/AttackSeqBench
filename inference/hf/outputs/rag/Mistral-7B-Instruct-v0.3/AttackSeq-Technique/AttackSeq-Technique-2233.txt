 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely happened to maintain persistence on the infected system after the Grabit malware has been downloaded.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence, which is directly related to maintaining the malware's presence on the infected system.
3. Among the answer choices, T1008-Fallback Channels, T1546.011-Application Shimming, and T1546.001-Change Default File Association are not directly related to maintaining persistence on the system.
4. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the technique that involves setting up a malware to run automatically during system boot or user logon, ensuring its persistence on the infected system.
5. Scheduled Task (T1053.005) is a method of persistence, but it is not mentioned in the answer choices. However, it is related to the question as it is a common method for maintaining persistence on a system.
6. Exfiltration techniques (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) are not related to maintaining persistence on the infected system.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1053.005 (Scheduled Task) for maintaining persistence, followed by the initial infection via T1002-Data from an External Device (in this case, the malicious macro). After the malware has been downloaded, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution would be the most likely technique to maintain persistence on the infected system.
