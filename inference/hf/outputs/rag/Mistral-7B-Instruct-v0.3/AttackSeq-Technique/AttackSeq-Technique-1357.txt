 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitated communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control server.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic, which is directly related to maintaining communication between an attacker and compromised systems.
3. The Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels suggests that multiple stages are involved in the communication, which implies the use of a more complex method than simple file transfer protocols (T1071.002).
4. The Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information indicates that obfuscation was used to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to communication methods.
5. The Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation is related to the obfuscation technique mentioned in T1027, but it doesn't specify the application layer protocol used for communication.
6. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it is directly related to communication between systems and is not limited to specific protocols, allowing for the use of multi-stage channels (T1104).
