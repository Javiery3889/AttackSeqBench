 Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests, after gathering information from a compromised iOS device.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Exfiltration (Tactic) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique). This suggests that data is being sent from the compromised device to a Command and Control (C2) server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique used to manipulate the ARP cache to redirect network traffic, but it does not involve communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests.
   - C: T1518-Software Discovery is a technique used to gather information about software on a target system, but it does not facilitate communication with a C2 server.
   - D: T1001.001-Junk Data is a technique used to obfuscate or hide malicious activity by injecting unnecessary data, but it does not facilitate communication with a C2 server.
   - B: T1102-Web Service, on the other hand, is a technique that involves an attacker using web services to communicate with a compromised system or C2 server. This technique can involve both POST and GET requests, making it a plausible choice given the question's requirements.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attack is related to Exfiltration, which involves sending data from the compromised device to a C2 server.
   - Out of the given answer choices, T1102-Web Service is the technique that best aligns with the question's requirements, as it involves communication over the network, which could include POST and GET requests, and it is also related to Exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the final answer is B: T1102-Web Service.
