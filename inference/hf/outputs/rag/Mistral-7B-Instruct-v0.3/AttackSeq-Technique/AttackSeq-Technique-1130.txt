 Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that allowed the BlackEnergy malware to bypass standard detection methods after initial access through exploiting MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761.

2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack is related to Execution (Tactic) and Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203). This suggests that the attacker has gained access to the system and executed malicious code.

3. The Initial Access tactic is already covered by the provided TTP (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment), which is not the technique we are looking for to bypass detection methods.

4. The Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001) is not directly related to bypassing detection methods, as it is a technique for remote access, not obfuscation.

5. Deploying a container (T1610) is not typically used for bypassing detection methods, but rather for creating a secure and isolated environment for running applications.

6. Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) is a technique used to make files or information difficult to analyze, which can help bypass detection methods. This seems to be the most plausible answer as it aligns with the question's requirement of bypassing detection methods.

7. Phishing (T1566) is a technique used to trick users into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links, but it does not directly help in bypassing detection methods.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566.001 (Initial Access) -> T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) -> T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information).
