 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of the RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX), which is a technique related to T1086-PowerShell. However, the question asks for the technique that maintains the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations, not the initial deployment method.

2. The related TTPs mention the tactics of Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion) and Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

3. T1070.004-File Deletion is not directly related to modifying system startup configurations.

4. T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is a method of persistence, not defense evasion, and it modifies the system's startup configurations, but it does not maintain the attack presence.

5. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique that maintains the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations, which aligns best with the question. This technique can be used to ensure the attacker's tools or scripts run every time the system boots or logs on, thus maintaining their presence on the system.

6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1086-PowerShell (to execute the batch script and deploy the RMS client), followed by T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (to maintain the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations).
