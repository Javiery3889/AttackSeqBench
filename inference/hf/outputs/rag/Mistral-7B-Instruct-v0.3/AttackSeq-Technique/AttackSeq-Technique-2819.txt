 Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Derusbi gathered system information about the victim's host for discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery). This is an initial step in an attack sequence.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This suggests that the attacker is likely to use a web protocol for communication with the command and control server.
3. Among the answer choices, T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication and T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call are not directly related to web protocols.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1082-System Information Discovery (gathering system information) followed by T1071-Application Layer Protocol (establishing communication with the command and control server via HTTP POST requests).
5. The answer choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol aligns best with the attack sequence in the question as it involves the use of web protocols for communication, which is supported by the related TTPs.
