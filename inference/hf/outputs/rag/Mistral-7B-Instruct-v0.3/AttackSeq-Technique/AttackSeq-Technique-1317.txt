 Final Answer: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique most likely used to communicate with remote servers to exfiltrate data and receive updates for the malware.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already collected information using various methods (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer) and the tactic is Exfiltration.
3. Technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration is related, but it doesn't specify the method of communication with the remote server.
4. Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a possibility, but it's not specified whether the attacker used an application layer protocol for communication.
5. Technique T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication is not related to data exfiltration or communication with remote servers.
6. Technique T1090.004-Domain Fronting is a method to bypass internet restrictions, not a communication method for exfiltration.
7. Technique T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible answer as it involves using application layer protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc.) for command and control communication, which is a common method for exfiltrating data and receiving updates for malware.
