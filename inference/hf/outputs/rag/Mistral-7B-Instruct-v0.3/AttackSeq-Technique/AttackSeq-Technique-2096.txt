 Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network (T1018-Remote System Discovery, T1046-Network Service Discovery). This indicates that they have gained initial access and are now exploring the network.
2. T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is about exploiting publicly-facing applications to gain access, which is not directly related to the internal network mapping.
3. T1021.007-Cloud Services is about exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which is a later stage of the attack and not typically performed immediately after network mapping.
4. T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations is about gathering geographical information about the target, which is not directly related to the internal network or lateral movement.
5. T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is about moving an attacker's tools and capabilities from one compromised system to another within the network. This is a logical next step after mapping the network, as the attacker would want to move laterally to gather more information, escalate privileges, or prepare for data exfiltration.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1018-Remote System Discovery, T1046-Network Service Discovery, T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
