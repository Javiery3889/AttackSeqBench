 Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. APT10 is known for using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control, and employing tools like Robocopy and PSCP for secure data transfer. These TTPs are related to the Tactic of Command and Control (T1055) and Data Staged (T1077).

2. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to enable the actor to exfiltrate data from victim networks to their C2 servers.

3. From the related TTPs provided, the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041) is given, which is the primary focus of the question.

4. Among the answer choices, T1003-OS Credential Dumping, T1602.002-Network Device Configuration Dump, and T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites are not directly related to the Tactic of Exfiltration. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, on the other hand, is a technique under the Tactic of Exfiltration and is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that would follow the command and control and data transfer stages.

Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs used by APT10 to exfiltrate data from victim networks to their C2 servers is:
- T1055.001-Command and Control: Phishing
- T1077-Data Staged: Data Staged (various tools like Robocopy and PSCP)
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
