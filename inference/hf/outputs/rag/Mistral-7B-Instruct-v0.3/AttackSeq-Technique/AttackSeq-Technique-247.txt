 Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that CertUtil.exe was disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' for evasion purposes, which aligns with T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location.
2. The attacker has executed the payload once, and the question asks for a technique to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.
3. T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1505.003-Web Shell do not directly address the persistence of the payload. T1583.007-Serverless might be used for persistence, but it is a more advanced technique and less likely to be used immediately after the initial execution.
4. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a technique used to ensure the repeated execution of a payload at specific intervals, making it the most plausible choice for maintaining persistence in this context.
