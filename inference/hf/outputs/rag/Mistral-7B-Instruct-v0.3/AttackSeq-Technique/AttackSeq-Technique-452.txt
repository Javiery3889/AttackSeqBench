 Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to distribute the malicious app.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers were involved in Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1647-Plist File Modification and T1036-Masquerading. These TTPs suggest that the attackers were trying to disguise their malicious apps and evade detection.
3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is an exploitation technique, not a distribution technique. It doesn't align with the context of the question.
   - B: T1566-Phishing is a technique used to distribute malware by sending deceptive emails or messages. This aligns with the context of the question as it allows for the distribution of malicious apps and can be followed by masquerading and file modification to evade detection.
   - C: T1564-Hide Artifacts is a technique used to remove or modify system artifacts to avoid detection after an attack. It doesn't help in the initial distribution of the malicious app.
   - D: T1037.004-RC Scripts is a technique used to execute scripts on a system. While it could be used to install the malicious app, it doesn't provide a method for distributing the app to victims, which is the focus of the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566-Phishing (distribution of malicious app) followed by T1036-Masquerading (disguising the malicious app) and T1647-Plist File Modification (further disguising the malicious app to evade detection).
