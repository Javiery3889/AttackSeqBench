 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information, which suggests the initial data collection phase (T1086).
2. The question then states that bidirectional communication with C2 servers occurs using HTTPS protocol encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.
3. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, which indicates the use of web protocols for command and control communication.
4. Among the answer choices, only T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) specifically mentions the use of application layer protocols, which aligns with the use of HTTPS for communication.
5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to bidirectional communication using HTTPS protocol encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.
6. T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy (A) is a method to route traffic through multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of the traffic, not a communication method itself.
7. T1546.009-AppCert DLLs (C) and T1106-Native API (D) are techniques related to executing code or actions on the system, not communication methods.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1086 (Initial Access) -> Data Gathering (T1080) -> T1071.001-Web Protocols (Communication with C2 servers using HTTPS).
