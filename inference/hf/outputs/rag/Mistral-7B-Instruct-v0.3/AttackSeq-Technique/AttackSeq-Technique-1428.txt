 Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after exploiting Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 during the strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) and client execution was achieved through exploitation (T1203).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution is not directly related to the exploitation of Internet Explorer or public-facing applications. It is more related to using legitimate tools in an illegitimate way, which is not indicated in the question.
   - C: T1564-Hide Artifacts is a technique used to cover the attacker's tracks, which typically occurs after the initial access and execution phases. It is not the most likely technique to occur immediately after the exploitation of Internet Explorer.
   - D: T1003.003-NTDS is a technique used to gain administrative credentials, which is not directly related to the exploitation of Internet Explorer or public-facing applications. It is also not typically used in the sequence of T1190 and T1203.
   - B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the technique that exploits a vulnerability in a publicly-facing application, which aligns with the exploitation of Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411. This technique is followed by T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is indicated in the related TTPs. Therefore, T1190 is the most plausible technique that occurred after the initial exploitation but before the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
