 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that MuddyWater gained initial access through spear-phishing attacks (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link). This means that the attackers have successfully tricked their targets into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments.

2. After gaining initial access, the attackers would need a way to maintain communication with their compromised systems (C2 servers) and perform further actions such as payload delivery and information collection.

3. Among the answer choices, T1665-Hide Infrastructure refers to hiding the presence of infrastructure used in an attack, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with compromised systems.

4. T1566-Phishing is the technique used to gain initial access, so it is not the most likely choice for the next step in the attack sequence.

5. T1584.006-Web Services is a technique used to exploit web applications, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with compromised systems.

6. T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique used to communicate with compromised systems over application layer protocols, which is the most likely choice for maintaining communication and performing further actions after gaining initial access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access) -> T1071-Application Layer Protocol (Execution).
