 Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools signed with stolen digital certificates to infect the victim's internal hosts. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before scanning the internal network for open ports to expand their foothold.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery. This suggests that the attacker is likely to perform network discovery to find open ports and expand their foothold.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery is not directly related to the internal network, as it is about discovering cloud services.
   - B: T1552.008-Chat Messages is not related to the internal network or expanding the foothold.
   - C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping is a technique used to gain access to resources on the internal network by harvesting credentials. This would provide the attacker with the necessary credentials to scan for open ports, which is the next step in the attack sequence.
   - D: T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to establish a secure communication channel, which is not directly related to the steps of infecting hosts, discovering the network, or scanning for open ports.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker has already infected the internal hosts (T1046) using the Nidiran back door and hacktools signed with stolen digital certificates.
   - To expand their foothold, the attacker needs to scan the internal network for open ports (T1087). However, before doing that, they would need credentials to access the resources on the network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred after infecting the hosts and before scanning the network is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, as it provides the attacker with the necessary credentials to access the network resources.
