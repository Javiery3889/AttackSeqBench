 Final Answer: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding. This indicates that the attacker has set up a communication channel with the C2 server.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This suggests that data exfiltration is likely to occur over the C2 channel.

3. Among the answer choices, T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is the most plausible as it involves data exfiltration over a non-C2 channel. The other options do not directly relate to the scenario described in the question.

4. T1558.001-Golden Ticket is a technique used for Kerberos ticket abuse, not data exfiltration.
T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique for exfiltrating data, but it does not specify that it is over a non-C2 channel.
T1560-Archive Collected Data is a technique for storing exfiltrated data, not the method of exfiltration itself.

Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1095.001 - Command and Control: Non-Application Layer Protocol (establishing communication with the C2 server)
- T1041.001 - Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel)
- T1048.001 - Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel, possibly to evade detection)
