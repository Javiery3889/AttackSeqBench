 Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that APT10 staged data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools. This suggests that the data was prepared for transfer, which aligns with the T1560 technique, "Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" being the final step in the data transfer process.

2. The related TTPs provided, T1560.001-Archive via Utility, also supports the conclusion that the data was archived before transfer.

3. T1020.001-Traffic Duplication is not related to data staging or exfiltration, but rather creating copies of network traffic.

4. T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging is a technique used to replace a legitimate process with a malicious one, which is not directly related to data exfiltration.

5. T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is a broader technique that includes various methods of data exfiltration, but it does not specify that the data was archived before transfer, which is what the question asks.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- APT10 used remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools and stage data for exfiltration (T1020, T1560.001).
- Then, they used the shared MSP infrastructure to execute the data transfer (implied by the question).
- Finally, they exfiltrated the archived data (T1560).
