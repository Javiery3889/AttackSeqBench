 Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that allowed the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
2. The related TTPs provided are T1204.002-Malicious File (used for downloading the malicious payload) and T1059.005-Visual Basic (used for creating the nefarious macros). However, neither of these techniques directly allows for maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
3. The Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1219-Remote Access Software is a technique that allows an attacker to establish a remote connection to a system, which would enable the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
4. While T1665-Hide Infrastructure could potentially be used to hide the infrastructure, it does not directly facilitate communication between the RMS executable and the threat actor's infrastructure.
5. T1566-Phishing is a tactic used to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malicious files, but it does not directly maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
6. JavaScript (T1059.007) is a scripting language that can be used in various ways, but it does not specifically facilitate maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1204.002 (Download malicious payloads via nefarious macros) -> T1059.005 (Use of Visual Basic for creating the nefarious macros) -> T1219 (Use of Remote Access Software for maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure).
