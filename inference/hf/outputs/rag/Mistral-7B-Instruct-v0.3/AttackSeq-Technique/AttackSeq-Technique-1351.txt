 Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a Flash exploit 'show.swf' using ActionScript to trigger the CVE-2015-5119 vulnerability. This action falls under the Tactic: Execution and Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, as it involves exploiting a client-side application (Adobe Flash Player) to execute malicious code.

2. The question then states that the attackers embedded the payload in the 'b.gif' image for its subsequent execution. This action is not directly related to the techniques listed in the answer choices, but it is a common practice in many attack scenarios, especially those involving exploitation.

3. The remaining answer choices (T1543.001-Launch Agent, T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion, T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools) do not align with the sequence of events described in the question. T1543.001-Launch Agent is about creating a new process in a system, T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion is about evading detection during the exploitation phase, and T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools is about disabling or modifying security software or tools on the system.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (to execute the Flash exploit and trigger the vulnerability) followed by the embedding of the payload in the 'b.gif' image (not a specific TTP, but a common practice in many attack scenarios).
