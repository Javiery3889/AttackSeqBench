 Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that occurred to ensure the scheduled transfer of collected data to the remote server every 10 minutes.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the tactic is Exfiltration, and the technique is either T1020-Automated Exfiltration or T1029-Scheduled Transfer.
3. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is not related to data transfer or exfiltration, so it can be ruled out.
4. T1484.002-Trust Modification is a technique used to manipulate trust relationships, not for data transfer.
5. T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage is a technique for exfiltrating data to cloud storage, but it does not specify that the transfer is automated or scheduled.
6. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique for exfiltrating data automatically, which aligns with the question's requirement of a scheduled transfer. Therefore, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most plausible answer.
