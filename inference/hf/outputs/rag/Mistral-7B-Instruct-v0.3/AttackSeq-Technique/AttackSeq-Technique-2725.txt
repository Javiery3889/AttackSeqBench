 Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments after utilizing a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration. The question also mentions leveraging a compromised router.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Command and Control (Tactic) techniques, specifically T1090.001-Internal Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling. Additionally, there is a Defense Evasion technique, T1599-Network Boundary Bridging.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1070.006-Timestomp does not seem to be related to the establishment of communication or leveraging a compromised router.
   - C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the network, not to establish communication.
   - D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is a technique used to bypass security controls, but it does not necessarily imply the establishment of communication or the use of a compromised router.
   - B: T1090-Proxy, on the other hand, is a technique used to establish a proxy connection, which aligns with the question's requirement of enabling communication between network segments. The "Internal Proxy" (T1090.001) mentioned in the related TTPs is a specific variant of T1090 that seems to be more relevant in this context. The use of a custom tunneling tool (mentioned in the question) could be a way to tunnel the proxy traffic, which is in line with the related TTP T1572-Protocol Tunneling.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments after utilizing a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Command and Control techniques, specifically T1090.001-Internal Proxy and T1572-Protocol Tunneling.
   - T1090-Proxy is a technique used to establish a proxy connection, which aligns with the question's requirement of enabling communication between network segments. The use of a custom tunneling tool could be a way to tunnel the proxy traffic, which is in line with the related TTP T1572-Protocol Tunneling. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - Utilize a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration (Question's given scenario)
     - T1572-Protocol Tunneling (to tunnel the proxy traffic)
     - T1090-Proxy (to establish a proxy connection between the network segments)
   - Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy.
