 Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types. The question also mentions that Discovery techniques were used to identify targeted files, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery techniques, specifically T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery, to discover removable drives. This suggests that the attacker is interested in data from removable media.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1127.002-ClickOnce is a technique used to download and install software, not related to gathering data from removable drives.
   - B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking is a technique used to intercept and steal credentials, not related to gathering data from removable drives.
   - C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates is a technique used to steal or forge digital certificates, not related to gathering data from removable drives.
   - D: T1025-Data from Removable Media is a technique used to gather data from removable media, which aligns with the question and the related TTPs. The fact that CosmicDuke skipped certain file types could be explained by the attacker's specific targeting or filtering mechanisms.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery techniques, specifically T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery, to discover removable drives.
   - Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     - T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery (to discover removable drives)
     - T1025-Data from Removable Media (to gather data from removable drives, skipping certain file types)
   - Therefore, the final answer is D: T1025-Data from Removable Media.
