 Final Answer: A: T1569-System Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the Derusbi server variant installed itself as a service through the DllRegisterServer function. This action is a clear indication of the T1569 technique, which is "System Services".
2. The related TTP T1543-Create or Modify System Process is not directly related to the installation of a service as a service, but rather creating or modifying a system process.
3. T1559.001-Component Object Model and T1053.005-Scheduled Task are not related to the installation of a service as a service.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1569 (System Services) followed by T1543 (Create or Modify System Process) if the Derusbi server variant were to create additional processes as part of its startup sequence. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after the service installation, so the answer is T1569-System Services.
