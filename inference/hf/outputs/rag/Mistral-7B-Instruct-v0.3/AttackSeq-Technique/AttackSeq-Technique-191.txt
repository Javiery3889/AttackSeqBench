 Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Infamous Chisel has automatically collected files from the local system and application directories, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System.
2. The Tactic: Exfiltration is mentioned in the question, and the related TTPs include T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique is used to send stolen data to a command and control (C2) server.
3. However, the question specifically mentions the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration. T1041 does not directly involve these methods.
4. The answer choices do not include T1041, but one of them, T1020-Automated Exfiltration, is a parent technique that encompasses various methods for exfiltrating data, including T1041.
5. Since the question mentions the use of Tor hidden service and SSH connections, it is reasonable to assume that the exfiltration technique would involve these methods. Therefore, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most plausible answer, as it allows for the inclusion of various exfiltration methods, including the use of Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
