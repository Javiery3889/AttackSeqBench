 Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitated communication with an attacker-controlled Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.
2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port are mentioned, which suggests that the attacker is using a non-standard port for command and control communication.
3. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that facilitated communication with the server, not the command and control method itself.
4. The answer choices provided are all related to data exfiltration techniques, and T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is the only one that involves the use of a web service, which aligns with the communication method using HTTP on port 443 mentioned in the question.
5. T1102-Web Service is a more general technique that involves using web services for various purposes, but it does not specify the use of HTTP on port 443.
6. T1572-Protocol Tunneling is a technique used to encapsulate traffic within another protocol, but it does not necessarily involve HTTP on port 443.
7. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is not related to communication with a server or the use of HTTP on port 443.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
1. T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service (to exfiltrate system information and screenshots to the Mattermost server)
2. T1571-Non-Standard Port (to use a non-standard port for the Mattermost server communication)
3. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (if the Mattermost server is being used as a command and control channel for further exfiltration activities).
