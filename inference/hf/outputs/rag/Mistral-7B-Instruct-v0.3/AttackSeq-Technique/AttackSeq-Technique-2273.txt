 Final Answer: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Regin utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.
2. The related TTPs provided are T1027.011-Fileless Storage and T1564.009-Resource Forking, both of which are Defense Evasion techniques.
3. T1027.011-Fileless Storage is about storing malicious code in non-traditional file storage areas, which aligns with the question's description of Regin's behavior.
4. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this initial evasion technique.
5. T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is a technique used to execute malicious code by modifying the execution flow of a legitimate process, which could be a possible next step after storing malicious code in non-traditional file storage areas.
6. T1113-Screen Capture and T1055.012-Process Hollowing are not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question. T1113-Screen Capture is about capturing the screen of a victim, which is not a typical next step after fileless storage. T1055.012-Process Hollowing is about replacing a legitimate process with a malicious one, which is not necessarily a logical sequence after storing malicious code in non-traditional file storage areas.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1027.011 (Fileless Storage) first, followed by T1574 (Hijack Execution Flow) as the next step.
