 Final Answer: C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses after the successful execution of Office Macro Scripts.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion and Technique T1036.009-Break Process Trees, which is a method used to evade detection by breaking the process tree.
3. Technique T1059.005-Visual Basic is a method of executing scripts or commands, but it doesn't necessarily evade detection or load the malware without alerting defenses.
4. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment is a method of delivering malicious content, but it doesn't directly help in evading detection after the malware is loaded.
5. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is a method of hijacking the execution of a legitimate process, but it doesn't directly help in loading the malware without alerting defenses.
6. Technique T1620-Reflective Code Loading is a method of loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which can help evade detection by not leaving a trace on the disk. This technique aligns best with the question's context as it can help load the malware without alerting defenses after the successful execution of Office Macro Scripts.
