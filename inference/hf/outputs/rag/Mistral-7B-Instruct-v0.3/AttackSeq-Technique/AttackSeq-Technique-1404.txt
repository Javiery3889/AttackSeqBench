 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that CVE-2015-2545 was exploited via spear phishing emails for initial access. However, the question asks about the technique used for communication with the attacker's infrastructure, not the initial access method.

2. The related TTPs mention the exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and the use of spear phishing links (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link). These TTPs suggest that the attacker might have used a compromised application to deliver the malicious content (like a malicious link or attachment) to the victim.

3. After achieving initial access and persistence, the attacker would need a way to communicate with their infrastructure. T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that involves using application layer protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, etc.) to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. This technique is commonly used for command and control (C2) communication.

4. T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is about exploiting software to gain higher privileges, not communication with the attacker's infrastructure. T1566-Phishing is about tricking users into providing credentials or downloading malware, not a communication method. T1090.001-Internal Proxy is about using an internal system as a proxy to communicate with the internet, which is not directly related to the attacker's infrastructure.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Initial Access: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails)
- Initial Access: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (delivering malicious content to the victim)
- Persistence: T1548.003-Windows Service (using an ActiveSetup registry key for persistence)
- Command and Control: T1071-Application Layer Protocol (communicating with the attacker's infrastructure)
