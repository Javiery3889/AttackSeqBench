 Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of malicious plugins for data destruction (D: T1485-Data Destruction) and backup communication (A: T1124-System Time Discovery is not related to system information discovery, C: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft is not related to system information, and B: T1082-System Information Discovery is not directly related to data destruction or backup communication but is a technique used to gather system information).
2. The question then asks for the technique that most likely occurred as the BE2 group collected detailed information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS to identify the host system.
3. T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique that involves gathering system information, which includes details about the BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1124-System Time Discovery (for backup communication over HTTPS)
   - T1082-System Information Discovery (for collecting detailed information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS to identify the host system)
   - T1485-Data Destruction (for data destruction)

So, the most likely sequence of TTPs is: Data Destruction (T1485) -> System Time Discovery (T1124) -> System Information Discovery (T1082).
