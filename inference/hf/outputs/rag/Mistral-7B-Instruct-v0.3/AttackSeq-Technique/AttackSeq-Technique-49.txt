 Final Answer: C: T1204.002-Malicious File

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that initial access was gained through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. This aligns with the Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
2. The malicious Word documents are likely to contain an encoded PowerShell script, as mentioned in the question. This is related to the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell.
3. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to execute the payloads downloaded by the encoded PowerShell script.
4. Among the answer choices, T1204.002-Malicious File is the most plausible as it refers to the execution of a malicious file, which in this case is the PowerShell script downloaded from the malicious Word document.
5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the execution of the PowerShell script. T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact is about encrypting data for impact, not executing a script. T1204-User Execution is a broader technique that includes various methods of user-initiated execution, but it does not specify the use of a malicious file. T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores is about exfiltrating data from cloud storage, not executing a script.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access)
- T1059.001-PowerShell (Execution)
- T1204.002-Malicious File (Execution)
