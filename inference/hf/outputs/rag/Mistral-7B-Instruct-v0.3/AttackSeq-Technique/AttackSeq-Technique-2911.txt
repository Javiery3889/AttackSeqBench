 Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe, which is an example of Defense Evasion (Tactic) and Technique T1112-Modify Registry (Related TTP).
2. The action facilitated the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor, which is an Execution (Tactic) and Technique T1059.003-Windows Command Shell (Related TTP).
3. To maintain persistence and further evade detection, APT15 could impair defenses by disabling Windows Event Logging (T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging, Related TTP).
4. The remaining answer choices do not align as well with the sequence of events described in the question. T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable is a technique used for establishing persistence at the kernel level, but it does not directly follow the actions of evading policy settings and installing a backdoor. T1556.005-Reversible Encryption and T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates are techniques that could be used in later stages of an attack, but they do not seem to be the most plausible next step after the initial evasion and backdoor installation.
