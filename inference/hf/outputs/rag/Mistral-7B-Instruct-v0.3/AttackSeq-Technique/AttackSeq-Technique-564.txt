 Final Answer: T1654-Log Enumeration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the malware collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information during the Discovery phase. This suggests that the malware is gathering information about the system and its resources.

2. The related TTPs include T1056.001-Keylogging, which is a technique used for collecting keystrokes, and T1654-Log Enumeration, which is a technique used to discover and read system logs.

3. Since keylogging is a more intrusive and detailed form of data collection compared to system information discovery, it is likely that the malware would perform keylogging after it has already gathered basic system information.

4. Screen recording (T1113-Screen Capture) and cloud storage object discovery (T1619) are more resource-intensive activities that might require more time and system resources, making them less likely to occur immediately after the initial discovery and keylogging stages.

5. Log enumeration (T1654) is a technique that involves reading system logs, which could provide the malware with additional information about the system and its activities. This technique is less resource-intensive than screen recording or cloud storage object discovery, making it a plausible step that could occur before these more resource-intensive activities.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information during the Discovery phase, but before it initiated logging activities like screen recording and keylogging, is T1654-Log Enumeration.
