 Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique most likely used to transfer stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the command and control infrastructure.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control and the Technique of T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation, which suggests that the attacker is using a method to disguise their communication with the C2 server as legitimate traffic.
3. The Tactic of Exfiltration is also mentioned, which indicates that the attacker is trying to steal data.
4. Among the answer choices, T1056-Input Capture is not directly related to data transfer, T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is not mentioned in the question, and T1563.002-RDP Hijacking is not related to the use of HTTP connections or specific URIs like <c2-domain>/login.php.
5. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as it involves transferring data to the command and control infrastructure, which aligns with the question and the related TTPs.
