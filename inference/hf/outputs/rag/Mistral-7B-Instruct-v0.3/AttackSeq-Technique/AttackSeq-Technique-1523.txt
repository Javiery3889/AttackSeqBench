 Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers modified a Javascript file on the CDN server to load malicious code, which is a form of Drive-by Compromise (T1189). However, this technique does not directly involve obfuscation or packing.

2. The attackers then evaded detection using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding. This technique (T1027.002-Software Packing) is a part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. The related TTPs provided (T1027.002-Software Packing and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) both fall under the Defense Evasion tactic. Obfuscation (T1027) is a broader technique that includes various methods to make data or code difficult to understand, while Software Packing (T1027.002) is a specific method of obfuscation that involves compressing or encrypting executable files.

4. Given that the attackers used a packer (T1027.002) to evade detection, it is likely that they obfuscated their malicious code (T1027) before packing it, as obfuscation is a common precursor to packing. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) -> T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) -> T1027.002 (Software Packing).
