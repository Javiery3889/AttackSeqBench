 Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host and before the stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Exfiltration (Tactic) and Collection (Tactic), with Screen Capture (T1113) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) being specifically mentioned. This suggests that the attacker is collecting data (screenshots) and sending it back to the Command and Control (C2) server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method is a technique used for data archiving, not for data exfiltration in this context.
   - C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks is a technique used by the attacker to check the activity of the user, not for data exfiltration.
   - D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique used to ensure persistence on the infected host, not for data exfiltration.
   - B: T1113-Screen Capture is a technique used for data collection, specifically capturing screenshots. This technique could be used to collect data (screenshots) before sending it back to the C2 server (T1041), which aligns with the sequence of events described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host (initial intrusion).
   - The attacker then collected data (screenshots) using T1113-Screen Capture.
   - Finally, the attacker exfiltrated the collected data (screenshots) over the C2 channel (T1041).
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host and before the stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure is B: T1113-Screen Capture.
