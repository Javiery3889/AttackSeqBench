 Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that enables communication after the backdoor has collected machine information and screenshots. This implies that the backdoor has already established a foothold in the system and is ready to transmit data.

2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Exfiltration, which suggests that the data collected by the backdoor is about to be sent out of the system. The technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a common method for exfiltrating data, but it is not specified in the question that the data is being sent over a Command and Control (C2) channel.

3. The answer choices are all related to communication techniques, but T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is about exploiting applications to gain access, not for communication. T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is about exfiltrating data from a network shared drive, not about enabling communication. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about transferring tools into the system, not about communication.

4. The remaining answer, T1102-Web Service, is a technique that involves querying external services and transmitting data, which aligns best with the question's requirement of enabling communication and transmitting encrypted messages. Since the data has already been collected and encrypted, it is plausible that the backdoor would use a web service to transmit the data. Therefore, the most likely answer is T1102-Web Service.
