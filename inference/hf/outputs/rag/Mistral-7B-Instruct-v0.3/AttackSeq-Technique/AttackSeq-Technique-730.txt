 Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that helped hide the 'mothership' control server's location in the 'Red October' campaign.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Command and Control (Tactic) and specifically mention T1071.004-DNS, which is a technique used for command and control but does not necessarily hide the location of the control server.
3. T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is a technique used to execute commands or scripts on a compromised system, but it does not directly help in hiding the control server's location.
4. T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique used to manipulate the search order of DLLs, but it does not help in hiding the control server's location.
5. T1008-Fallback Channels is a technique used to establish alternative communication channels, but it does not directly help in hiding the control server's location.
6. T1568-Dynamic Resolution is a technique used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses in a way that hides the true location of the control server by using a series of intermediate servers. This technique aligns best with the question as it helps in hiding the 'mothership' control server's location.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the 'Red October' campaign's C&C servers hiding the 'mothership' control server's location would be: Execution (T1059) -> Command and Control (T1090) -> Command and Control (T1071.004) -> Command and Control (T1568).
