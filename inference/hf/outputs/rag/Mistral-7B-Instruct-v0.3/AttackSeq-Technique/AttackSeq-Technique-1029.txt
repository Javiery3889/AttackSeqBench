 Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique used to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares after the backdoor was used for discovery.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is collecting data from the local system (T1005) and network shared drives (T1039).
3. Among the answer choices, T1596.002-WHOIS, T1553-Subvert Trust Controls, and T1213.001-Confluence are not directly related to data collection from the local system or network shares.
4. T1119-Automated Collection is a technique that involves the use of automated tools to collect data from various sources, including local systems and network shares, which aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.
