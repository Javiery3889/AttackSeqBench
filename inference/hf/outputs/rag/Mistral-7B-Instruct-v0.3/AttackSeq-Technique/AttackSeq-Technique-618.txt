 Final Answer: T1564-Hide Artifacts

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and ensured detection was evaded by deleting itself post-execution.
2. Analyzing the answer choices, we can see that T1102-Web Service, T1556.007-Hybrid Identity, and T1547.007-Re-opened Applications do not involve file manipulation or deletion, which contradicts the given scenario.
3. The remaining answer choice, T1564-Hide Artifacts, aligns well with the given scenario as it involves techniques to hide or delete objects, such as files, to evade detection.
4. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion, further supports the selection of T1564-Hide Artifacts, as file deletion is a method used to hide artifacts and evade detection.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be: T1036.003 (Obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe') -> T1070.004 (File Deletion to delete the script post-execution) -> T1564.001 (Hide Artifacts to evade detection).
