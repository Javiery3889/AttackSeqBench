 Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor collected data in a custom storage file format (T1005-Data from Local System).
2. The question asks for the technique most likely used to transfer the data from the victim's system.
3. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
4. Since the data was collected and stored locally, it is less likely that it would be exfiltrated over USB (T1052.001) or shared modules (T1129) without being sent to a command and control server first.
5. The technique T1590.001-Domain Properties is not related to data exfiltration.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1005 (Data from Local System) followed by T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
