 Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the Comfoo C2 server acted as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console. This implies that the server is facilitating communication between two parties, which is a key characteristic of a proxy.

2. The related TTPs provided are T1090-Proxy and T1071.001-Web Protocols. T1090-Proxy is specifically about using a proxy for command and control, which aligns with the question's context. T1071.001-Web Protocols is a broader technique that includes using web protocols for command and control, but it doesn't necessarily imply the use of a proxy.

3. The question also mentions that the C2 traffic was encrypted in an HTTP request. While this could potentially be related to T1071.001-Web Protocols, it's more specific to T1090-Proxy, as proxies can be used to encrypt traffic.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1086: Initial Access (e.g., using a RAT to gain access)
   - T1055: Lateral Movement (to move within the network)
   - T1087: Data Encrypted (to encrypt C2 traffic)
   - T1090: Command and Control (using a proxy for C2)

However, the question only asks for the technique that most likely occurred when the Comfoo C2 server acted as a relay point, so the final answer is T1090-Proxy.
