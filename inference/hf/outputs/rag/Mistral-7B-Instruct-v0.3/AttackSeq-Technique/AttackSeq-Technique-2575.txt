 Final Answer: T1059.005-Visual Basic

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely facilitated the adversary's entry into the target system before the obfuscated JavaScript payload executed by the VBA-Macro functions started communicating with IP 66.133.129.5.

2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that Tactic: Execution is mentioned, which suggests that the technique in question is related to the execution of malicious code or scripts.

3. Among the answer choices, T1566-Phishing, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information are not directly related to the execution of VBA-Macro functions. On the other hand, T1059.005-Visual Basic is a technique that involves the use of Visual Basic scripts, which aligns with the VBA-Macro functions mentioned in the question.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1059.005-Visual Basic (adversary executes a malicious VBA-Macro script to gain entry into the system)
   - T1059.001-PowerShell (the VBA-Macro script could potentially use PowerShell to execute the obfuscated JavaScript payload)
   - T1059.003-Command Line Interface (the PowerShell script could use command line to communicate with IP 66.133.129.5)
   - T1059.004-Windows Management Instrumentation (the command line could use WMI to communicate with IP 66.133.129.5, but this is less likely given the specific TTPs provided)
   - T1059.005 again (the obfuscated JavaScript payload executed by the VBA-Macro functions starts communicating with IP 66.133.129.5)
