 Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates the transfer of information collected by CosmicDuke.
2. CosmicDuke is known to use tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers for data collection (T1056.001-Keylogging).
3. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Exfiltration, which is the act of transferring data out of a system, and the specific technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
4. Given that CosmicDuke has already collected sensitive information, the most logical next step would be to exfiltrate this data, which aligns with the technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the collection and transfer of data from the victim system, making them less plausible in this context. T1025-Data from Removable Media and T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service are techniques for exfiltrating data but do not fit the sequence of events described in the question. T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is a technique for gathering information about the victim's network, not for exfiltrating data.
