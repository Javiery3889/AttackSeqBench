 Final Answer: T1559.001-Component Object Model (D: T1559.001)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that a JavaScript backdoor was dropped, which suggests an Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution).
2. The malware then executed an obfuscated script, which aligns with the Technique T1059.007-JavaScript (Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript).
3. The obfuscated script loaded a DLL file in memory, which is a Defense Evasion technique (Tactic: Defense Evasion).
4. The related TTPs provided include T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, both of which are Defense Evasion techniques.
5. T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM) is a technique that allows an attacker to load DLLs in memory, making it the most plausible answer choice for the next step in the attack sequence.
