 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events leading up to the deployment of RYUK ransomware. The question mentions Command-and-Control (C2) communications with an IP address and a URL, which suggests an initial compromise and establishment of a C2 channel.

The related TTPs provided (T1571-Non-Standard Port) aligns with the initial compromise and C2 establishment, as it involves using non-standard ports to evade detection. This technique is often used to establish a C2 channel.

The other answer choices (T1593.003-Code Repositories, T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook) are more related to later stages of an attack, such as data exfiltration or initial access to code repositories, which typically occur after the C2 channel has been established.

Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port.
