 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitates periodic communication between the EVILNUM agent and the C2 server.
2. The related TTPs suggest that the agent has already exfiltrated data (T1029 and T1041) and is likely to have discovered system information (T1082).
3. T1005-Data from Local System and T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation do not directly facilitate communication between the agent and the C2 server.
4. T1569-System Services could potentially be used for communication, but it is more commonly associated with the use of system services for attacker's purposes, not for communication.
5. Application Layer Protocol (T1071) is the most plausible answer as it involves the use of protocols at the application layer to communicate with the C2 server, which is necessary for the agent to receive tasks and obtain a unique identifier.
