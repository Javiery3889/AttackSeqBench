 Final Answer: D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Bisonal malware evaded defenses using an RC4 cipher for encrypting its C2 address strings and hardcoded values for the initial HTTP POST connection. This indicates that the malware is using encryption to communicate with its command and control (C2) server.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Command and Control and Technique T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, which aligns with the use of an RC4 cipher for encryption.

3. T1071-Application Layer Protocol, T1566-Phishing, and T1021.004-SSH are not directly related to the use of encryption for C2 communication.

4. T1572-Protocol Tunneling is a technique that involves encapsulating network traffic within another protocol to bypass security controls. This technique is often used for C2 communication and can involve the use of encryption, which makes it the most plausible answer choice.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Bisonal malware evaded defenses using an RC4 cipher is T1572-Protocol Tunneling.
