 Final Answer: T1018-Remote System Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the discovery phase after the execution phase, where remote administration tools were downloaded.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the Discovery tactic is relevant, with T1018-Remote System Discovery being specifically mentioned.
3. T1018 involves an adversary using various methods to discover hosts, services, or open ports on a network, which aligns well with the scenario where cybercriminals are exploring the financial systems of the targeted organization after gaining initial access through downloaded remote administration tools.
4. T1564-Hide Artifacts, T1027.008-Stripped Payloads, and T1087-Account Discovery are techniques related to the Execution, Defense Evasion, and Discovery tactics, respectively, but they do not directly relate to the discovery phase after the execution phase as described in the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1204-User Execution (download remote administration tools) -> T1018-Remote System Discovery (explore the financial systems of the targeted organization during the discovery phase).
