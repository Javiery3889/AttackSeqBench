 Final Answer: T1082-System Information Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software (T1518) as part of the discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing discovery activities, specifically system network configuration discovery (T1016) and system information discovery (T1082).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1090.001-Internal Proxy and T1113-Screen Capture are not directly related to the discovery phase or gathering system information.
   - T1069.003-Cloud Groups is a technique used to discover cloud resources, not system information on a local machine.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather detailed information about the system, which could include host and network information, making it a logical step before discovering installed software (T1518).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred prior to T1518-Software Discovery.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing discovery activities, specifically system network configuration discovery (T1016) and system information discovery (T1082).
   - T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather detailed information about the system, which could include host and network information, making it a logical step before discovering installed software (T1518). Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1082-System Information Discovery followed by T1518-Software Discovery.
