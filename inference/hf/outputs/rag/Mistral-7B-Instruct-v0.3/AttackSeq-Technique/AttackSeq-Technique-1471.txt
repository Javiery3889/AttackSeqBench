 Final Answer: A: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the SLUB backdoor was used to collect data from the victim's system. This suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now performing post-exploitation activities.

2. The related TTPs provided, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1082-System Information Discovery, are both part of the Discovery tactic. This indicates that the attacker is likely gathering more information about the system to further their objectives.

3. Among the answer choices, T1056.004-Credential API Hooking is the technique that best aligns with the Discovery tactic and the context provided in the question. Credential API Hooking allows an attacker to intercept and modify credentials, which could be used to gather additional system information or maintain persistence on the compromised system.

4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the Discovery tactic or the context of the question. T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay is a technique used for lateral movement, T1562-Impair Defenses is used to disable or impair security solutions, and T1113-Screen Capture is used for surveillance and reconnaissance. Therefore, T1056.004-Credential API Hooking is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the SLUB backdoor was used to collect data from the victim's system.
