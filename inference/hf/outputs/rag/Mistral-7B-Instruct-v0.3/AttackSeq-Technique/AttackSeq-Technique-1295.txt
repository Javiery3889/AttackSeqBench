 Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the establishment of persistence and the use of a Poison Ivy server process, which is a remote access Trojan (RAT). This implies that the attacker has already gained initial access and is looking to maintain that access.

2. The question also mentions securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP. This suggests that the attacker wants to ensure their communication with the compromised system is encrypted and not easily intercepted.

3. The related TTPs provided, T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, suggest that the attacker is using a non-standard port and a non-application layer protocol for their command and control (C2) communication. This is often done to evade detection.

4. Among the answer choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most plausible as it involves the use of an encrypted channel for communication, which aligns with the need to secure communication over a custom network protocol. The other answer choices do not directly relate to securing communication or using a custom network protocol. T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation is about generating multi-factor authentication requests, T1090-Proxy is about using a proxy to connect to a target, and T1546-Event Triggered Execution is about executing a file or command based on system events. T1573 is the best fit for the given scenario.
