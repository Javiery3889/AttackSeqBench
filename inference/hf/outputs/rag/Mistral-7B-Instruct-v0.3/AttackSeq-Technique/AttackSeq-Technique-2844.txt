 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware sent system information to a C2 server using the command line. This action is typically associated with the Command and Control (Tactic) T1059.
2. The question also states that the communication with the C2 server was done using HTTPS with a POST method. This information suggests that the malware is using an Application Layer Protocol (T1071) to communicate with the C2 server.
3. The answer choices are related to different techniques, but only T1071-Application Layer Protocol aligns with the communication method mentioned in the question (HTTPS with a POST method).
4. The other answer choices do not provide a clear connection to the communication method used in the question. T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is about exfiltrating data from a dead drop, T1072-Software Deployment Tools is about installing or updating executables, and T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance is about reverting cloud instances to a known state.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1059.001 (Command and Control)
- T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol)

This sequence suggests that the malware first establishes a connection with the C2 server (T1059.001) and then uses an Application Layer Protocol (T1071.001) to send system information to the C2 server. The specific method used for the communication (HTTPS with a POST method) is not specified in the sequence, but it is mentioned in the question.
