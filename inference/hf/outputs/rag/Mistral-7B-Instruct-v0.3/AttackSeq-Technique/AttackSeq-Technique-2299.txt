 Final Answer: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is performing Discovery (Tactic) to gather information about the victim's network configuration (T1016) and is hiding their infrastructure (T1665). They also suggest the use of DNS (T1071.004) for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is about gathering information about the network, but it doesn't necessarily have to occur before the use of malicious techniques for traffic redirection.
   - T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules is about hiding email traffic, which doesn't seem directly related to the network infrastructure reconnaissance.
   - T1590.005-IP Addresses is about gathering IP addresses, but it doesn't provide enough context to determine if it occurred before the network infrastructure reconnaissance.
   - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is about discovering network configurations, which is a common first step in reconnaissance to understand the target network before performing actions like redirecting traffic.
   - T1071.004-DNS is a command and control technique, and while it could be used for reconnaissance, it doesn't necessarily have to occur before the initial network discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (to gather information about the network) followed by T1665-Hide Infrastructure (to hide the attacker's presence) and then T1071.004-DNS (for command and control) and finally the malicious techniques for traffic redirection. Therefore, the answer is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
