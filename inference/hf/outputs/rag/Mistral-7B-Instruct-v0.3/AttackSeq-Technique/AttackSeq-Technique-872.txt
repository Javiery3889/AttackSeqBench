 Final Answer: T1090.002-External Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that GreyEnergy operators used Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials, which suggests they have already gained initial access to the target system (Tactic: Initial Access).
2. The next step is to establish Command and Control (C2) over the compromised system for further communication.
3. The related TTPs mention T1090.002-External Proxy, which is a technique used for establishing C2 through an external proxy. This technique is often used for stealthy communication, as mentioned in the question.
4. T1021.006-Windows Remote Management, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, and T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application are techniques used for remote access, but they do not directly relate to the establishment of an external proxy for C2 communication.
5. T1070.004-File Deletion is a technique used for data destruction, which does not seem to be the next logical step after gaining credentials and setting up C2.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1080.007 (Initial Access), T1588.002 (Resource Development - Tool), T1090.002 (Command and Control - Proxy), and T1090 (Command and Control - C2). The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before redirecting requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers, and T1090.002 best fits this description.
