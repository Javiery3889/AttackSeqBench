 Final Answer: T1018-Remote System Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: FIN7 conducted data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client during the Collection stage. Before this, we need to find the technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Collection and the Technique of T1074.002-Remote Data Staging, which is a method used for exfiltration during the Collection stage. This suggests that the data discovered during the network reconnaissance and data discovery phase (using Cobalt Strike) is being staged for exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1497.001-System Checks is a technique used to gather information about the target system, but it doesn't directly relate to the data discovered during network reconnaissance or the staging of data for exfiltration.
   - B: T1018-Remote System Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the target system, but it also involves discovering open ports, services, and operating systems, which could help in the staging of data for exfiltration.
   - C: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to a system, but it doesn't directly relate to the data discovered during network reconnaissance or the staging of data for exfiltration.
   - D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is a technique used to execute commands on the target system, but it doesn't directly relate to the data discovered during network reconnaissance or the staging of data for exfiltration.

4. Based on the related TTPs and the comparison, T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most plausible technique that occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery, as it could help in the staging of data for exfiltration (as indicated by the related TTP T1074.002-Remote Data Staging).
