 Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that SideCopy used njRAT malware to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. This indicates an Exfiltration tactic.
2. The related TTPs also mention the Exfiltration tactic and specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB.
3. T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception and T1659-Content Injection are not directly related to the exfiltration of data, but rather to manipulating or intercepting authentication processes or injecting content into systems.
4. T1056-Input Capture is a technique that involves capturing keystrokes or other input, but it does not necessarily imply the exfiltration of data.
5. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique that involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system or external storage. This technique aligns best with the question, as it describes the action of exfiltrating the Kavach authentication databases.
6. Given that the data was exfiltrated over a C2 channel (T1041), it is likely that the exfiltration was automated (T1020) to efficiently transfer the large amount of data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (used by SideCopy to transfer the data)
- T1020: Automated Exfiltration (the technique used to automate the transfer of the Kavach authentication databases)
