 Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations before Mustang Panda fetched additional shellcode.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is related to Command and Control and specifically mentions T1102-Web Service. This suggests that the attacker might have used a web service for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is not directly related to the deployment of a malware implant like PlugX. It is more about using non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a technique used to schedule malicious tasks to run at a later time, but it doesn't necessarily imply the initial deployment of the implant.
   - C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is about moving tools or information within a network, which doesn't seem to be the initial deployment of an implant.
   - D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about delivering malware to a system from an external source, which aligns well with the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used to deploy the PlugX implant.
   - The related TTPs suggest a web service for Command and Control.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about delivering malware to a system from an external source, which aligns well with the initial deployment of the PlugX implant and the use of a web service for Command and Control. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) followed by T1102 (Web Service) for Command and Control operations.
