 Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Shuckworm downloaded additional payloads from their C&C servers. This action falls under the Execution tactic.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that persistence was maintained through scheduled tasks (T1053.005), which suggests that the initial execution was also done through a scheduled task (T1053.005).
3. The question asks for the technique that occurred after maintaining persistence through scheduled tasks.
4. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the technique that involves the transfer of tools or malware into the target environment. This technique is often used after initial access to download additional payloads or tools.
5. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is not the technique that describes downloading additional payloads from C&C servers.
6. T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy is a technique used to establish a connection through multiple systems to hide the origin of the connection. This technique is not directly related to downloading additional payloads.
7. T1555.001-Keychain is a technique used to steal or dump credentials, which is not related to downloading additional payloads.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Initial Access: T1053.005-Scheduled Task (to execute malicious VBS scripts)
- Initial Persistence: T1053.005-Scheduled Task (to maintain persistence)
- Execution: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (to download additional payloads)
