 Final Answer: T1574.014-AppDomainManager

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to maintain the Trojan's presence across reboots under system directories.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Persistence (Tactic) and DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001- Technique). This suggests that the attacker manipulated the DLL search order to load their malicious DLL during runtime.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence, but it doesn't directly relate to dynamically loading a DLL during runtime.
   - B: T1110-Brute Force: This technique is related to guessing passwords or encryption keys, not maintaining persistence or DLL manipulation.
   - C: T1129-Shared Modules: This technique involves loading libraries from shared locations, but it doesn't directly relate to dynamically loading a DLL during runtime or maintaining persistence across reboots.
   - D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager: This technique involves manipulating AppDomain to load DLLs, which aligns with the question's description of dynamically loading a backend API DLL during runtime. Additionally, it can be used to maintain persistence by loading the Trojan during system startup, which fits the requirement of maintaining presence across reboots.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to maintain the Trojan's presence across reboots under system directories.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker manipulated the DLL search order to load their malicious DLL during runtime (T1574.001).
   - Among the answer choices, T1574.014-AppDomainManager is the technique that involves manipulating AppDomain to load DLLs, which aligns with the question's description and the related TTPs. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1574.001 (DLL Search Order Hijacking) -> T1574.014 (AppDomainManager).
