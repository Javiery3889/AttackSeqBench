 Final Answer: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to establish communication with C2 servers after the TAIDOOR RAT decrypts and executes the main malware in memory.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the Tactic of Command and Control is involved, which suggests that the attacker is trying to establish communication with the compromised system.
3. The Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols is also mentioned, which indicates that the attacker might be using web protocols for communication. However, this technique does not necessarily imply bidirectional communication.
4. The Technique T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is related to the TAIDOOR RAT, as it is a known technique used by this RAT for communication with its C2 servers.
5. The Technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is a Defense Evasion technique and does not directly relate to establishing communication with C2 servers.
6. The Technique T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1204-User Execution are not directly related to the question, as they do not describe a method for establishing communication with C2 servers.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1071.001 (Web Protocols) followed by T1102.002 (Bidirectional Communication). This sequence suggests that the attacker used web protocols to establish a connection with the compromised system, and then used bidirectional communication to send and receive data.
