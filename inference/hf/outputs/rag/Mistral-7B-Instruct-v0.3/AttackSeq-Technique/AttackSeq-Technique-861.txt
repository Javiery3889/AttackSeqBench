 Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that TG-3279 has established beachheads and is using compromised credentials to add scheduled system tasks. This suggests that the attacker has gained access to the network and has a foothold.
2. The question also mentions that C2 communication is happening using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic. This indicates that the attacker is using a non-standard method for communication, as port 443 is typically used for HTTPS traffic.
3. The related TTP T1571-Non-Standard Port is about using non-standard ports for command and control. This technique involves using ports other than the standard ones for communication, which aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic in the question.
4. The other answer choices do not align as well with the scenario described in the question. T1071.003-Mail Protocols is about using email protocols for command and control, which does not involve using a non-standard port for communication. T1595-Active Scanning is about network reconnaissance, not command and control. T1583-Acquire Infrastructure is about establishing new infrastructure, not facilitating C2 communication.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1080.001 - Initial Access (to gain access to the network)
2. T1078 - Valid Accounts (to obtain compromised credentials)
3. T1055 - Lateral Movement (to move within the network and establish beachheads)
4. T1003 - Credential Dumping (to dump credentials for later use)
5. T1571 - Non-Standard Port (to facilitate C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic)
