 Final Answer: T1570.003-Lateral Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the adversary used Cobalt Strike's built-in abilities for lateral movement, which includes SMB and PsExec for deploying beacons on additional systems within the victim's network. This indicates that the adversary has gained access to multiple systems within the network.

2. The related TTPs provided, T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares, is a technique used for lateral movement within a network, which aligns with the initial action of the adversary.

3. T1005-Data from Local System and T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services are techniques related to data collection and exploitation, respectively. However, these techniques are more likely to occur after the adversary has established a foothold within the network and has begun their data collection phase.

4. T1021.007-Cloud Services and T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions are techniques that could be used during the command and control phase or during data collection, but they are not directly related to the lateral movement of the adversary within the network.

5. T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is a technique used to move tools or malware from one compromised system to another within the network. This technique is a logical next step after the initial lateral movement, as it allows the adversary to further propagate within the network and prepare for data collection or other malicious activities.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) for initial lateral movement
- T1570.003 (Lateral Tool Transfer) to move tools for further propagation within the network
- T1005 (Data from Local System) or T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) for data collection.
