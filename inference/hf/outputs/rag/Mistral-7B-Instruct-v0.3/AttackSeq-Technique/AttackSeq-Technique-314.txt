 Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that BitterAPT initially distributed their malware through compromised websites, which aligns with the Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
2. The malware then communicates with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers, which is a part of the Tactic: Command and Control.
3. The related TTPs mention Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, which implies that the communication is two-way.
4. Among the answer choices, T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule and T1566-Phishing are not related to bidirectional communication or CnC servers. T1568-Dynamic Resolution, on the other hand, is a technique that involves the use of domain generation algorithms (DGA) or other methods to resolve CnC servers dynamically, which fits the description of communicating with multiple CnC servers.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) followed by Command and Control (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication) facilitated by T1568-Dynamic Resolution.
