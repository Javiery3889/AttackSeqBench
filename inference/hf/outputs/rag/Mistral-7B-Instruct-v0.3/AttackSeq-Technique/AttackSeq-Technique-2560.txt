 Final Answer: T1553.002-Code Signing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely allowed the adversary to execute their plan before using Mocelpa's fake SSL handshake for defense evasion.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the adversary is using Protocol or Service Impersonation (T1001.003) and Code Signing (T1553.002) for Command and Control and Defense Evasion tactics respectively.
3. Phishing (T1566) and Hardware Additions (T1200) are not directly related to the given TTPs or the question's context.
4. Code Signing (T1553.002) is a technique used to sign malware with a legitimate digital certificate, allowing it to bypass security measures such as antivirus software. This could help the adversary gain initial access to the Taiwanese Government's systems, enabling them to gather sufficient information about the target.
5. Once the adversary has gained access, they can then use Mocelpa's fake SSL handshake for defense evasion (T1553.003), as mentioned in the question.
6. Therefore, T1553.002-Code Signing is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that allowed the adversary to execute their plan before using Mocelpa's fake SSL handshake.
