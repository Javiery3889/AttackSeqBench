 Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions defense evasion techniques such as redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services. These techniques are often used to bypass security controls and make malicious activities less detectable.
2. The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation.
3. T1056.003-Web Portal Capture is a specific technique under the Credential Access tactic, which involves capturing credentials through web beacons, JavaScript, or other methods on a web portal. This technique aligns with the question's mention of phishing pages impersonating login portals.
4. T1656-Impersonation is a defense evasion technique, but it does not directly involve accessing credentials.
5. T1003.004-LSA Secrets and T1090-Proxy are techniques related to privilege escalation and lateral movement, respectively, and do not directly involve accessing credentials through phishing pages.
6. T1587-Develop Capabilities is a tactic that involves creating custom tools or modifying existing ones for malicious purposes, but it does not directly involve accessing credentials through phishing pages.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Defense Evasion (T1656-Impersonation) to bypass security controls, followed by Credential Access (T1056.003-Web Portal Capture) to access credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals.
