 Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the initial access was gained through Tropic Trooper's exploitation of Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. The technique should involve user interaction or action to trigger the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution to gain initial access. This suggests that the attacker exploited a client-side vulnerability to execute code on the victim's machine. However, the question asks for a technique that involves user interaction, which T1203 does not provide.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The remaining answer choices are T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1564.009-Resource Forking, and T1648-Serverless Execution. None of these techniques directly involve user interaction or action to trigger the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

4. T1204-User Execution is the only technique that aligns with the attack sequence in the question, as it involves the user executing a malicious file, which could be the backdoor's installer in this case. The user's action or interaction triggers the deployment of the installer, making T1204 the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial exploitation.
