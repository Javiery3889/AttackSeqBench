 Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely employed during the Reconnaissance phase after Initial Access was gained through exploiting CVE-2017-8750.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through a spear-phishing attack (T1566).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT are techniques used for Scripting and Execution, not Reconnaissance.
   - B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases is a technique used for Discovery, not Reconnaissance.
   - C: T1598-Phishing for Information is a technique under the Reconnaissance tactic, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - D: T1204-User Execution is a technique for Initial Access, not Reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely employed during the Reconnaissance phase after Initial Access was gained through exploiting CVE-2017-8750.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through a spear-phishing attack (T1566).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566) -> Reconnaissance (T1598-Phishing for Information).
   - Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information.
