 Final Answer: A: T1046-Network Service Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of a scanning tool (HUC Port Banner Scanner) for network Discovery. This suggests that the attacker is trying to gather information about the network, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
2. Among the answer choices, only T1046-Network Service Discovery directly relates to the use of a scanning tool for network discovery.
3. T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls is related to process analysis and is not directly related to network discovery or movement within the network.
4. T1534-Internal Spearphishing and T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services are techniques used for initial access or lateral movement, not for discovery or movement within the network after initial access.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1046 (Network Service Discovery) to gather information about the network, followed by other TTPs for initial access and movement within the network.
