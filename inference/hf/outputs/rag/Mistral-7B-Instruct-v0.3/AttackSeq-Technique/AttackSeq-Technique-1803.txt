 Final Answer: T1590.001-Domain Properties

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from C2 servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Defense Evasion techniques, specifically T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. This suggests that the attacker is using encryption or encoding to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries does not directly relate to encoding configuration files or disrupting websites. It is about persistence on a system by adding entries to the XDG autostart files.
   - B: T1498-Network Denial of Service is a technique used to make a network resource unavailable to its intended users. It does not involve encoding or decoding files.
   - C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood is a technique used to exhaust system resources, such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth, to make a system unresponsive. It does not involve encoding or decoding files.
   - D: T1590.001-Domain Properties involves manipulating domain properties, such as changing DNS records or domain registration details. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly involve encoding or decoding files.

4. However, T1590.001-Domain Properties could be used in conjunction with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File to disrupt a website. For example, the attacker could encode the website's configuration files, then change the DNS records to point to a server hosting the encoded files. This would effectively take the website offline until the configuration files are decoded and the DNS records are corrected. Therefore, T1590.001-Domain Properties is the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario.
