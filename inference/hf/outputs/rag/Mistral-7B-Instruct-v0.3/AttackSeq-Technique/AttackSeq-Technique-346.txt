 Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gaining initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique. The question specifically mentions the execution of code using system services.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through the Supply Chain Compromise technique. This means the attackers gained access to the system by compromising a software update.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1057-Process Discovery is about identifying and gathering information about running processes on a system. This technique does not involve executing code using system services, so it is less likely to be the next step after initial access.
   - B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence is about removing or disabling artifacts of previously established persistence mechanisms. This technique does not involve executing code using system services, so it is less likely to be the next step after initial access.
   - C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT are techniques for executing scripts or code. However, these techniques are not specifically related to system services, and there is no mention of scripting in the question, so it is less likely to be the next step after initial access.
   - D: T1569-System Services is about executing commands or scripts as system services. This technique involves executing code using system services, which aligns with the question's requirement.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after gaining initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through the Supply Chain Compromise technique.
   - The question specifically mentions the execution of code using system services.
   - Out of the given answer choices, T1569-System Services is the technique that involves executing code using system services, making it the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access.
   - Therefore, the final answer is D: T1569-System Services.
