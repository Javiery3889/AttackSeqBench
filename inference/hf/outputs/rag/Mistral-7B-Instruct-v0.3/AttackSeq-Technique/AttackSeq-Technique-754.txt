 Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server using stealthy POST requests and encryption.

2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the Tactic is Command and Control, which suggests that the attacker is maintaining control over the compromised system.

3. The techniques T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service are both exfiltration techniques, which involve sending data out of the compromised system. However, they do not necessarily follow the establishment of encrypted communication with the command-and-control server.

4. T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition is a technique used for loading dynamic libraries, which is not directly related to the establishment of an encrypted communication channel or data exfiltration.

5. T1573-Encrypted Channel is the technique that best aligns with the question, as it describes the use of encryption for communication, which is similar to the encryption used in the initial communication with the command-and-control server. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker would continue to use an encrypted channel for further communication or commands, making it the most likely technique to occur after the initial communication.
