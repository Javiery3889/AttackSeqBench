 Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to execute malicious plugins like 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll' on Windows systems after utilizing the 'bs.dll' plugin for gathering system information under the Discovery tactic.

2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the Tactic of Defense Evasion is mentioned twice, and the Technique T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is mentioned as well. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which aligns with the question's context of executing malicious plugins.

3. Among the answer choices, only option C: T1129-Shared Modules directly relates to the loading of malicious DLLs into a legitimate process. This technique involves an attacker using shared libraries or DLLs to execute malicious code.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Discovery (T1080): Gathering system information using the 'bs.dll' plugin.
   - Defense Evasion (T1574.002): DLL Side-Loading to execute malicious plugins like 'dstr.dll' and 'grc.dll'.
   - Defense Evasion (T1129): Shared Modules to load these malicious DLLs into legitimate processes.

So, the final answer is C: T1129-Shared Modules.
