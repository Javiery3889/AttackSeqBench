 Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant has ensured persistence on the system by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder (T1547.001).
2. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after persistence but before communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
3. The Related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, which suggests that the attacker will likely use a command and control server to communicate with the compromised system.
4. To achieve this communication, the attacker needs to execute a command or script on the compromised system, which is the definition of T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
5. The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of events as well. T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery is not necessary after persistence has been established. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery could be a possible choice, but it is not as directly related to the communication with control servers as T1059. D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay is not related to the communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1547.001 (Persistence) -> B: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) -> T1071.001 (Command and Control).
