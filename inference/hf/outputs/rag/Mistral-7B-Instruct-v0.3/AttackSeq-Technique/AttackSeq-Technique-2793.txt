 Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to send the information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.
2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding is mentioned, which involves encoding data for exfiltration.
3. Among the answer choices, T1132-Data Encoding is the technique that directly relates to encoding data, which aligns with the question and the related TTPs.
4. The other answer choices do not directly involve encoding data for exfiltration. T1614-System Location Discovery is about discovering the system's location, T1090.004-Domain Fronting is about using a third-party domain to bypass internet restrictions, and T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools is about compromising software development tools, none of which involve encoding data for exfiltration.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1087-Network Sniffing (to collect sensitive information)
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding (to encode the collected data for exfiltration)
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (to send the encoded data out via the command and control channel)
