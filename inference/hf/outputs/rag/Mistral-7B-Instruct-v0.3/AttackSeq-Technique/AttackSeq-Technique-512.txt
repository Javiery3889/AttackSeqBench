 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transmit data after achieving persistence through the use of HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1547) and the Technique of Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001). This indicates that the attacker has established persistence on the compromised system.
3. The question also mentions that encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data is transmitted via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.
4. The answer choices are techniques that could potentially be used for data transmission.
5. T1591-Gather Victim Org Information is not related to data transmission.
6. T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol could be a possibility, but it is less likely because the question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests, which is an Application Layer Protocol.
7. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (D) is a persistence technique, not a data transmission technique.
8. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves the use of Application Layer Protocols for data transmission, which aligns with the transmitted data being via HTTP POST requests.
