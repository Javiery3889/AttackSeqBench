 Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to further extract visual data from the victim's system after the backdoor function gathered machine information during the Discovery phase.

2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the Discovery tactic is mentioned twice, indicating that the attacker is gathering information about the system.

3. T1124-System Time Discovery is a technique used to discover the system's time, which is not directly related to extracting visual data.

4. T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather system information, but it does not specifically target visual data.

5. T1102-Web Service and T1213.001-Confluence are techniques that do not seem to be directly related to extracting visual data either.

6. T1113-Screen Capture is a technique used to capture the contents of the screen, which aligns with the question's requirement of extracting visual data from the victim's system.

7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1124-System Time Discovery (Discovery phase), T1113-Screen Capture (to extract visual data).
