 Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that NanHaiShu remained active across system reboots, which indicates the use of persistence techniques.
2. The related TTPs specify the Tactic of Persistence and the Technique T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
3. The question also mentions that the 'network.js' file was written and the registry was modified, but these actions do not align with the techniques of T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking, T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites, or T1082-System Information Discovery.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's context is the use of T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution to ensure NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots. This technique involves modifying the system's startup or logon processes to execute the malware upon system startup or user logon. In this case, the VBA macros writing the 'network.js' file and modifying the registry could be part of the initial infection process, and the use of T1547 ensures the malware persists across reboots.
