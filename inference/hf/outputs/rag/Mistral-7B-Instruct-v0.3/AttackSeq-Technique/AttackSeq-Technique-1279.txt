 Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Tropic Trooper exploited Microsoft Office vulnerabilities to gain initial access and downloaded an MSI package. This aligns with Tactic: Initial Access (T1078) and Technique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1203). However, the question asks for the technique that occurred as part of executing the backdoor installer, not the initial access.

2. The related TTPs mention T1197-BITS Jobs, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion. This suggests that the attacker is trying to hide their activities by using BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

3. Among the answer choices, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is the technique that best fits the scenario. This technique involves the use of command-line interpreters to execute scripts or commands. In this case, the backdoor installer is likely a script or executable file that is launched using a command interpreter, such as cmd.exe or powershell.exe.

4. The other answer choices do not align as well with the scenario. T1204.001-Malicious Link is about using URLs to deliver malware, but there's no indication that a malicious link was used in this case. T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is about redirecting legitimate processes for malicious purposes, but there's no indication that this was done with sidebar.exe. T1558.001-Golden Ticket is about using a forged Kerberos ticket to gain access to resources, but there's no indication that this was used in the scenario.
