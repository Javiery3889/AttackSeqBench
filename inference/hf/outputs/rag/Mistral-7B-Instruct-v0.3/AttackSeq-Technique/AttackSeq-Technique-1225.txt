 Final Answer: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the initial access was gained through exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves exploiting a public-facing application (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190) and client-side execution (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203).
3. The POWERSHOWER and C2 server communication mentioned in the question suggests that the attackers have already gained some level of access, but not necessarily initial access. Techniques like T1590.003 (Network Trust Dependencies), T1496.001 (Compute Hijacking), T1598 (Phishing for Information), and T1070 (Indicator Removal) are more related to maintaining access or evading detection, not initial access.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word)
   - Execution: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (the exploit leads to the execution of the attacker's code)
   - After this initial sequence, the attackers may use other TTPs like POWERSHOWER and C2 server communication to perform actions based on the status code of a GET request, but these would occur after the initial access.
