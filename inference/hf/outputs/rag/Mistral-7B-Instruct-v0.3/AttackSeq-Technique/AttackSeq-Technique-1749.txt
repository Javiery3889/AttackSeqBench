 Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance, which suggests the initial access and reconnaissance phase (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Phishing and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1086-External Remote Services).

2. The question then states that compromised domain credentials were used to access shared folders over SMB, which aligns with Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.

3. The question asks about the lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network. While T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer could be a method for transferring tools for further actions, it does not specify the movement between IIS servers.

4. T1087.004-Cloud Account and T1021.007-Cloud Services are techniques related to cloud-based activities, which do not seem to be directly related to the movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.

5. Therefore, the most plausible technique for the lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network is T1021-Remote Services, as it involves the use of legitimate remote services to execute commands on the target system, which aligns with the use of SMB for accessing shared folders.
