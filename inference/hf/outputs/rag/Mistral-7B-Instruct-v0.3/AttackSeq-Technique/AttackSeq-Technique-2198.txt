 Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Earth Lusca deployed containers and used obfuscation techniques to conceal their activities. This suggests that they are trying to evade detection, which aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion. However, the techniques related to Defense Evasion (T1027, T1564, T1571) do not directly involve the dumping of LSASS memory.

2. The question also mentions the dumping of the LSASS process memory using procdump to obtain credential hashes. This is a technique related to Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory).

3. The Tactic: Credential Access is typically performed after the attacker has gained some level of access to the system, which could have been achieved through various means such as exploiting a public-facing application (T1190), abusing elevation control mechanisms (T1548), or impairing defenses (T1562).

4. Among the answer choices, T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism are techniques that could potentially grant the attacker the necessary access to the system, but they do not necessarily imply the impairment of defenses. On the other hand, T1562-Impair Defenses is a technique that could both grant the attacker access and prepare the ground for further actions, such as the dumping of LSASS memory. Therefore, T1562-Impair Defenses is the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the group dumped the memory of the lsass process.
