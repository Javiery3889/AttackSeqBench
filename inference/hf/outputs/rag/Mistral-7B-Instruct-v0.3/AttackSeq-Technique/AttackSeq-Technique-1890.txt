 Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that occurred after WMI was used for remote command execution, which is a method of lateral movement.
2. The goal of the attacker (FIN13) is to gather information on network configuration to support their operational objectives.
3. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that T1016 is mentioned, which is System Network Configuration Discovery. This technique involves gathering information about network configuration, which aligns with the goal of the attacker.
4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the goal of gathering information on network configuration. T1016.001 (Internet Connection Discovery) is about discovering internet connectivity, T1505 (Server Software Component) is about exploiting known vulnerabilities in software, and T1078.001 (Default Accounts) is about exploiting default or weak account credentials.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation) for lateral movement, followed by T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) to gather information on network configuration.
