 Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after transmitting stolen credentials.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN4 uses web protocols (T1071.001) for command and control, exfiltration over C2 channel (T1041), and initially gained access through spearphishing links (T1566.002).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information is not directly related to maintaining anonymous communication with C2 servers.
   - T1590.002-DNS is a technique used for locating C2 servers, not for maintaining anonymous communication.
   - T1205.001-Port Knocking is a technique used to establish a connection with a server, but it doesn't necessarily ensure anonymous communication.
   - T1090-Proxy, on the other hand, is a technique used to establish a connection to a target network by leveraging a proxy server, which can help maintain anonymity. This aligns best with the need for anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitated FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs indicate that FIN4 uses web protocols (T1071.001) for command and control, exfiltration over C2 channel (T1041), and initially gained access through spearphishing links (T1566.002).
   - T1090-Proxy is a technique that can help maintain anonymity by establishing a connection to a target network through a proxy server. This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible method for maintaining anonymous communication, especially when using web protocols.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) -> T1071.001 (Web Protocols) -> T1090 (Proxy) for anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.
