 Final Answer: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server. The communication is encrypted and hex-encoded, and it uses commonly used ports.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Command and Control (Tactic) and the use of Standard Encoding (T1132.001) and Non-Standard Port (T1571).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1568-Dynamic Resolution is a technique used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, which does not directly relate to the establishment of encrypted communication.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is a technique used to capture the contents of the screen, which does not seem to be related to the establishment of encrypted communication.
   - T1547.012-Print Processors is a technique used to manipulate print spooler services, which also does not seem to be directly related to the establishment of encrypted communication.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel, on the other hand, is a technique used to establish encrypted communication, which aligns well with the described communication in the question. The use of non-standard ports (T1571) and standard encoding (T1132.001) could be part of the encrypted channel setup, making this the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs is: T1573-Encrypted Channel (establishing encrypted communication) followed by T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1132.001-Standard Encoding (as part of the encrypted channel setup).
