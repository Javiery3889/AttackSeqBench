 Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that FamousSparrow executed SparrowDoor on the compromised systems. SparrowDoor is likely a malware or a payload that needs to be delivered to the compromised systems.

2. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, indicate that the attacker initially gained access to the systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint.

3. After gaining initial access, the attacker would typically perform further actions to maintain persistence, move laterally, and establish command and control. However, the question specifically asks about the technique that most likely occurred after executing SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

4. The technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution involves exploiting a client-side vulnerability to execute malicious code on the compromised system. This technique aligns best with the scenario where the attacker delivers and executes SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

5. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the execution of SparrowDoor on the compromised systems. T1082-System Information Discovery is about gathering information about the system, T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification is about modifying the security policy, and T1053.002-At is about lateral movement using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
