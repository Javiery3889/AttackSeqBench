 Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands, and then maintaining access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are Persistence, Execution, and Defense Evasion. The Persistence TTP T1546.015 is related to Component Object Model (COM) Hijacking, which is the method used to maintain access. The Execution TTP T1059.001 is related to PowerShell, which was used to deploy the Beacon. The Defense Evasion TTP T1140 is not directly related to the question, but it's good to know that the attacker might have used it to hide their activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1059.009-Cloud API is not related to the persistence or the method used to maintain access, so it can be ruled out.
   - B: T1505.004-IIS Components is not directly related to the persistence or the method used to maintain access, so it can be ruled out.
   - C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job could be a plausible answer as it is a common method for persistence, and the attacker could have scheduled the Beacon to run at regular intervals, allowing them to maintain access.
   - D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is not directly related to the persistence or the method used to maintain access, so it can be ruled out.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker first executed T1059.001-PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
   - To maintain access, the attacker then used T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking to hijack RegIdleBackup and alter its associated COM handler.
   - As a persistence mechanism, the attacker could have used T1053-Scheduled Task/Job to ensure the Beacon runs at regular intervals, making C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job the most plausible sequence of TTPs.
