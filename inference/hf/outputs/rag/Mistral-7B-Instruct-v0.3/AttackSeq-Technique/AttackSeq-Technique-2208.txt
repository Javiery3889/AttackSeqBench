 Final Answer: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary used scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network and before they utilized tools to compress and exfiltrate data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Discovery (T1018-Remote System Discovery) and Collection (T1560.001-Archive via Utility). However, there is no direct mention of a technique related to Scheduled Tasks or Data from Local System.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a technique used to schedule the execution of malicious tasks at a later time. This could be used to schedule the compression and exfiltration of data, which is the next step mentioned in the question.
   - T1546.001-Change Default File Association is a technique used to manipulate the operating system to open files with a specific program, but it doesn't necessarily have to be scheduled for a later time.
   - T1005-Data from Local System is a technique used to access data stored on the compromised system, but it doesn't necessarily have to be used before compressing and exfiltrating the data.
   - T1560.001-Archive via Utility is the next step in the attack sequence, but it doesn't provide a clear preceding technique.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the discovery phase and before the data exfiltration phase. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a technique that could be used to schedule the execution of the data compression and exfiltration tools, making it the most plausible choice. Therefore, the final answer is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.
