 Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers used a spear phishing technique with a remote template to deliver a payload. This aligns with Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1199-Spearphishing, but the question asks for the technique that allowed access by exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882).

2. The related TTPs provided mention Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which suggests that an exploit was used to execute code on the victim's system.

3. The question also mentions that the attackers leveraged a year-old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882. This vulnerability is an Office Remote Code Execution vulnerability, which falls under the category of exploiting public-facing applications (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).

4. The other answer choices do not align as well with the provided information. T1598-Phishing for Information is a technique used to gather information, not to gain access. T1134.002-Create Process with Token and T1133-External Remote Services are techniques related to privilege escalation and remote services, respectively, which are not directly related to the exploitation of a specific vulnerability to gain initial access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1199-Spearphishing (Initial Access) to deliver the payload
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (Execution) to exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability
- T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (Execution) to gain access to the system.
