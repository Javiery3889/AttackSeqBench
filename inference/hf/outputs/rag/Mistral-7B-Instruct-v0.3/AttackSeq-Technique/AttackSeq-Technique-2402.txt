 Final Answer: D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes an attack sequence where a trojanized file is downloaded and executed, followed by the removal of attack artifacts.
2. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1070-Indicator Removal and T1070.004-File Deletion. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is trying to hide their presence and remove traces of their activity.
3. Among the answer choices, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter and T1585-Establish Accounts do not directly relate to the removal of attack artifacts. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is about sending stolen data back to the attacker, not about deleting artifacts.
4. T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is a technique that involves using the command shell to execute commands, scripts, and programs. This technique can be used to execute the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, which is mentioned in the question and is related to T1070.004-File Deletion. Therefore, T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario.
