 Final Answer: A: T1087.001-Local Account

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the Naikon APT group's Aria-body loader has already established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key and injected itself into processes such as 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'. This means that the attacker has already gained a foothold in the system and has persistence mechanisms in place.

2. The related TTPs provided do not directly indicate the next step after establishing persistence. However, one of the common tactics after gaining persistence is to create a local account to maintain access to the system. This is represented by T1087.001-Local Account.

3. System Information Discovery (T1082) is a tactic that could occur at various stages of an attack, but it is not necessarily the next step after establishing persistence. Phishing (T1566) is a different tactic used to deliver malware or gain credentials, which does not seem to be the next logical step after the described persistence mechanism.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1547.001 (Persistence) - Establishing persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key
   - T1087.001 (Local Account) - Creating a local account to maintain access to the system.
