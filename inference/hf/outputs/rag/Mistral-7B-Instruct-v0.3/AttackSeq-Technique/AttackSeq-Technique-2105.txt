 Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that data transmission with the C&C server was established using a specific protocol. This suggests that the attacker has already set up a communication channel with the C&C server.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using Command and Control (Tactic) and Web Protocols (Technique: T1071.001). This suggests that the attacker is using a web-based protocol for communication, which could be HTTP, HTTPS, or another web protocol.
3. To ensure the data transmission with the C&C server is secure, the attacker would likely use an encrypted channel to protect the data from being intercepted or read by third parties. This aligns with the T1573 technique, which is "Encrypted Channel".
4. T1665-Hide Infrastructure is not related to securing data transmission but rather hiding the infrastructure used for command and control. T1005-Data from Local System and T1542.004-ROMMONkit are not relevant to securing data transmission with a C&C server.
