 Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the Duke group communicated securely with their C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
2. The question also mentions that sensitive information was archived and transmitted utilizing legitimate cloud services. This suggests that the exfiltration of data occurred, but not necessarily through a C2 channel or configuration repository.
3. T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol and T1602-Data from Configuration Repository do not seem to fit the context of the question as they do not involve web services or cloud services for exfiltration.
4. T1585.003-Cloud Accounts is a technique for initial access to cloud resources, not for exfiltration.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1071.001 (Communication with C&C server over web protocols) followed by T1567 (Exfiltration over web service) as it best aligns with the archiving and transmission of sensitive information utilizing legitimate cloud services mentioned in the question.
