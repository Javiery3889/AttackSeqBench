 Final Answer: D: T1569.002-Service Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that BlackEnergy malware communicated with C&C servers, which falls under the Tactic: Command and Control. The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols suggests that the communication might have been done through web protocols, but it does not necessarily mean that the malware was downloading or uploading data using these protocols.
2. The question then asks for the technique that allowed the operators to assess the suitability of the infected computer and deploy regular BlackEnergy variants upon activation. This implies that some form of system configuration or service manipulation might be involved.
3. T1129-Shared Modules, T1001-Data Obfuscation, and T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall do not directly relate to assessing the suitability of the infected computer or deploying regular BlackEnergy variants.
4. T1569.002-Service Execution, on the other hand, involves the execution of services on the compromised host, which could be used to deploy additional malware or tools to assess the system's capabilities. This technique aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.
