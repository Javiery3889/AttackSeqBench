 Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique used to collect geo-location data from the device after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7.
2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location is present. This technique is often used to disguise malicious activity as legitimate system behavior, which aligns with the XAgent app hiding its icon.
3. However, T1036.005 does not directly provide geo-location data. Instead, it sets the stage for other techniques to be used without raising suspicion.
4. The Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System is also present, which suggests that the attacker is interested in collecting data from the device.
5. Among the answer choices, T1132-Data Encoding, T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules, and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery do not directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1036.005 (Defense Evasion) to hide the XAgent app, followed by T1614 (Collection) to collect geo-location data from the device.
