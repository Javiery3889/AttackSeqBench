 Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled attackers to execute malicious code by leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms such as atom tables.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation and Technique T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call, which is a specific method of Process Injection.
3. Process Injection (T1055) is a technique used to execute code in a running process, bypassing process-level restrictions. This aligns with the scenario where attackers bypassed process-level restrictions and injected malicious code into trusted processes.
4. AtomBombing is a specific method of Process Injection, but it is not a separate ATT&CK technique. Instead, it is a technique used under T1055.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection (AtomBombing)
   - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call (if applicable)

So, the final answer is D: T1055-Process Injection.
