 Final Answer: A: T1021-Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Agrius has already achieved persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which is related to T1543.003-Windows Service and T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary.
2. To ensure command execution, they would need a method to remotely execute commands on the compromised system. T1021-Remote Services is a technique that involves using remote services to execute commands on a target system.
3. T1070-Indicator Removal is about removing or modifying indicators of compromise to evade detection, but it doesn't directly help in ensuring command execution.
4. T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection is a technique for executing code in the memory of a running process, but it doesn't necessarily help in ensuring command execution after achieving persistence.
5. T1202-Indirect Command Execution is a technique where an attacker uses a legitimate program to execute malicious commands, but it doesn't seem to be the most plausible sequence of TTPs after achieving persistence and deploying a backdoor.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Agrius to ensure command execution and minimize detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is T1543.003 (Persistence) -> T1554 (Compromise Host Software Binary) -> T1021 (Remote Services).
