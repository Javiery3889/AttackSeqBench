 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions evading detections through CPU core checks and utilizing large null-padded files, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic. The related TTPs T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information also fall under the Defense Evasion tactic, further supporting this connection.
2. The question then mentions emitting network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data for communication with the server. This action is most likely to be associated with the Application Layer Protocol technique (T1071) as it involves the use of protocols to communicate over a network.
3. The other answer choices do not directly involve emitting network beacons or the use of encrypted data for communication with the server. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is related to persistence, T1071.003-Mail Protocols is a specific application layer protocol (email) and T1037.003-Network Logon Script is a technique for executing commands on a compromised system, not for emitting network beacons.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is:
- Defense Evasion (T1027.013, T1140)
- Command and Control (T1071)
- Discovery (T1071.003, if email is used as the communication channel)
- Defense Evasion (T1027.001, if large null-padded files are used)
- Command and Control (T1071, emitting network beacons)
