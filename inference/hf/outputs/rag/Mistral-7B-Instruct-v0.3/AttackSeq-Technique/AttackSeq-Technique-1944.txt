 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to obfuscate traffic while communicating with C2 servers over HTTPS.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker has already exfiltrated data (T1041) and is using an alternative protocol (T1048.002) for exfiltration.
3. Obfuscation of traffic is a common technique used to hide malicious activities, and it often occurs at the application layer (T1071).
4. DNS (T1071.004) and Clipboard Data (T1115) are not directly related to obfuscating traffic over HTTPS.
5. Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048) is not a technique for obfuscating traffic, but rather an alternative method for exfiltrating data.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Exfiltration of data (T1041) over a C2 channel.
   - Obfuscation of traffic (T1071) while communicating with C2 servers over HTTPS.

So, the technique that most likely occurred to obfuscate traffic while communicating with C2 servers over HTTPS is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
