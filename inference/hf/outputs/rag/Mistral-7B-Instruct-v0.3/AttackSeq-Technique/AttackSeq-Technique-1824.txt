 Final Answer: C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the Service Worker script intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API to steal username and password pairs.

2. The related TTPs provided are T1040-Network Sniffing (Discovery) and T1040-Network Sniffing (Credential Access).

3. T1040-Network Sniffing is a technique used to eavesdrop on network traffic to gather information. However, it is not a technique for stealing credentials directly.

4. The question asks for a technique that occurred after the Service Workker script intercepted and stole credentials. This suggests a technique that would use the stolen credentials, such as T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie or T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets.

5. Kerberos tickets are typically used in Windows domain environments, and the question does not specify a Windows environment. Therefore, T1558 is less likely.

6. Web session cookies are commonly used for authentication in web applications, and the question involves a webmail login API. Therefore, T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie is the most plausible answer.
