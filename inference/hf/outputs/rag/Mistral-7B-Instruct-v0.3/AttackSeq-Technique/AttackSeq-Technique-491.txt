 Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that enabled the malware to maintain evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.
2. The related TTPs mention the tactic of Defense Evasion and the technique T1553, which is about subverting trust controls. This technique is often used to bypass security controls by using legitimate digital certificates or other means to gain trust.
3. T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing and T1600.001-Reduce Key Space are not directly related to the exploitation of a Safari bug or the use of a signed Apple developer certificate.
4. T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is a technique used to execute commands or scripts on a target system, but it does not directly help in maintaining evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.004-Exploits (to exploit a Safari bug)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing (to obtain a signed Apple developer certificate)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.003-Subvert Trust Controls (to use the signed certificate to maintain evasion)
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (to install the modular backdoor for remote command capabilities)
