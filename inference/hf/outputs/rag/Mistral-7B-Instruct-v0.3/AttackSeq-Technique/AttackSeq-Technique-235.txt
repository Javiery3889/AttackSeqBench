 Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the initial access was gained through spear phishing emails with malicious documents. This aligns with the Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566-Phishing.
2. The malicious documents contained scripts to fetch additional payloads, which suggests the use of a Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) to execute these scripts.
3. The main payload was then executed by batch files decoded from base64 text. This implies that the decoded files were scripts or commands that required a Command and Scripting Interpreter to run.
4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question. T1559-Inter-Process Communication is about communication between processes, T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is about exploiting system mechanisms to gain higher privileges, and T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation is about bypassing or manipulating multi-factor authentication. None of these techniques are directly related to the execution of scripts or batch files from a base64-encoded payload.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1566-Phishing (Initial Access)
- T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (Execution)
- (Other TTPs related to the main payload execution or lateral movement)
