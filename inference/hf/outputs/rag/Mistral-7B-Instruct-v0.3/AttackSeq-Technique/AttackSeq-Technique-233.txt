 Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that allowed the malware to execute the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Privilege Escalation and Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control. This indicates that the attacker is trying to bypass UAC to gain higher privileges.
3. The answer choices are all related to different techniques, but only T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism directly addresses the bypassing of UAC, which aligns with the question and the related TTPs.
4. T1566-Phishing, T1546.010-AppInit DLLs, and T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data are not directly related to bypassing UAC or executing a payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control (Privilege Escalation) to gain higher privileges.
- T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (Privilege Escalation) to bypass UAC and execute the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
