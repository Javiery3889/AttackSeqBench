 Final Answer: T1555.001-Keychain

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Infamous Chisel used its netd component for system discovery, which involves enumerating multiple directories and performing IP scanning.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Discovery tactic, and specifically, it seems to be focusing on techniques related to file and directory discovery, network configuration discovery, and network sniffing.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1040-Network Sniffing is related to the Discovery tactic, but it is not directly related to file and directory discovery, which is suggested by the question and the related TTPs.
   - T1106-Native API is not directly related to file and directory discovery or system network configuration discovery, which are the focus of the question and the related TTPs.
   - T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks is related to system discovery, but it is more about scanning IP blocks, not scraping files containing sensitive data, which is suggested by the question.
   - T1555.001-Keychain is about stealing or dumping credentials, which could involve scraping files containing sensitive data, and it is related to the Discovery tactic, making it a plausible choice.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests that Infamous Chisel used its netd component for system discovery after performing another technique that involved scraping files containing sensitive data and deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.
   - T1555.001-Keychain is the technique that best fits this description as it involves stealing or dumping credentials, which could involve scraping files containing sensitive data, and it is related to the Discovery tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1555.001-Keychain (scraping files containing sensitive data) followed by T1040-Network Sniffing (sniffing network interfaces).
