 Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique used by the Duke group to securely communicate with the C2 server after using Seaduke.
2. Seaduke is a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to control a compromised system.
3. The Duke group is known for using various techniques to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
4. The related TTPs provided, T1071.001-Web Protocols, suggests that the communication between the Duke group and the C2 server might be web-based. However, it does not necessarily mean that the communication was not encrypted.
5. T1505.002-Transport Agent is related to using a transport agent to send emails, which does not align with the context of the question.
6. T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets is not directly related to secure communication between the Duke group and the C2 server.
7. T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most plausible answer as it describes the use of an encrypted channel for communication, which aligns with the context of the question and the related TTPs.
8. B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols is not the most likely answer as it refers to using mail protocols for command and control, which does not align with the context of the question.
