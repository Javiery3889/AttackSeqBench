 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a malicious file, "%Temp%/Rdws.exe", which was retrieved by a second-stage PlugX file. This aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (Related TTP).

2. The question also mentions the communication of the malware with C2 domains, such as inocnation[.]com. This suggests the use of a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is a Tactic: Command and Control.

3. Among the answer choices, T1001.002-Steganography is not directly related to communication, T1189-Drive-by Compromise is more about delivering malware through a compromised website, and T1005-Data from Local System is about exfiltrating data from a local system, not facilitating communication.

4. Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it is the technique that most likely facilitates communication between the malware and the C2 server, which is what the question asks for.
