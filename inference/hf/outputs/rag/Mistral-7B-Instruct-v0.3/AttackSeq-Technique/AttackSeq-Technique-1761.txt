 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of multiple VBS backdoors and execution of VBS scripts for potential data collection. This aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting.
2. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, suggest that the attacker is using web protocols for command and control.
3. Among the answer choices, only T1071-Application Layer Protocol involves the use of web protocols, which is the most plausible technique for establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads after the initial data collection phase.
4. T1571-Non-Standard Port, T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job, and T1053-Scheduled Task/Job do not directly relate to the use of web protocols for command and control as described in the question and the related TTPs.
