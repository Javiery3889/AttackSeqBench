 Final Answer: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions bypassing detection with an encrypted shellcode, which is a form of obfuscation. This action aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion.
2. The related TTPs include T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, both of which are Defense Evasion techniques.
3. T1610-Deploy Container, T1573-Encrypted Channel, and T1564-Hide Artifacts are not directly related to loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload after bypassing detection with an encrypted shellcode.
4. T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is the technique that best aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it involves decoding or deobfuscating files, which could include a DLL containing the decrypted payload.
