 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitated communication between Mustang Panda (the attacker) and compromised systems.
2. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion (Tactic) and the Double File Extension trick (T1036.007), which is a technique used to evade detection by antivirus software. This suggests that the attacker has already gained initial access and is trying to hide their presence.
3. The Initial Access TTPs provided in the question are T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which aligns with the given scenario of using malicious '.lnk' files for initial access.
4. After initial access, the attacker would need a method to communicate with the compromised system and command it. Application Layer Protocol (T1071) is a technique used for this purpose, allowing the attacker to communicate with the compromised system using various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB.
5. The other answer choices do not directly facilitate communication between the attacker and the compromised system. T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is a technique used for data obfuscation, T1010-Application Window Discovery is used to discover running applications, and T1566-Phishing is the initial access technique used in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access)
- T1036.007-Double File Extension (Defense Evasion)
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol (Command and Control)
