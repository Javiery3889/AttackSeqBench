 Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains after a POST request was made to a C2 domain.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about Command and Control tactics, specifically the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) and Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1071.003-Mail Protocols is not related to the transfer of tools or payloads via a POST request to a C2 domain.
   - T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication is not related to the transfer of tools or payloads or communication with multiple C2 domains.
   - T1566-Phishing is not directly related to the transfer of tools or payloads or communication with C2 domains, although it could be a method used to initially establish a foothold in the network.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the technique that involves the transfer of tools or payloads to an already compromised system, which aligns best with the question's context. The POST request to the C2 domain could be a part of this technique.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains after a POST request was made to a C2 domain.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the question is about Command and Control tactics, specifically the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) and Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105).
   - T1071.003, T1556.001, and T1566 are not directly related to the question's context.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - Initial compromise (T107x, T108x, etc.)
     - Command and Control (T1055)
     - Web Protocols (T1071.001) to establish a connection to the C2 domain
     - Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) to transfer additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.
   - Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
