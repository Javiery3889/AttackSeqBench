 Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the execution of a malicious Word document (T1204.002-Malicious File) through a VBA macro, which led to the creation and running of "vba_macro.exe".

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Execution tactic, and the techniques within this tactic are related to the execution of files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1485-Data Destruction is not directly related to the execution of a file, but rather to the destruction of data.
   - B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI is not related to the execution of a file, but rather to the manipulation of network devices using command-line interfaces.
   - C: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API is not directly related to the execution of a file, but rather to the manipulation of cloud services using API calls.
   - D: T1204-User Execution is the technique that involves the execution of a file by a user, which aligns best with the question as it describes the execution of "vba_macro.exe" after the malicious Word document was opened.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1204.002-Malicious File (execution of a malicious Word document)
   - T1204-User Execution (execution of "vba_macro.exe" by the user)
   - (Other techniques may follow depending on the malware's intended actions)
