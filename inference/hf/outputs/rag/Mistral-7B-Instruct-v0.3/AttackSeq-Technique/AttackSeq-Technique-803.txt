 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the creation of a JavaScript file that uses the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information. This action falls under the Discovery tactic (Tactic: T1080).
2. The related TTPs provided, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, is a technique under the Discovery tactic that involves discovering system network configurations, which includes IP addresses. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server, not just discovering IP addresses.
3. The other answer choices do not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is about creating or using scheduled tasks, T1090.001-Internal Proxy is about using internal network resources as proxies, and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery is about discovering internet connections, not system network configurations.
4. The only answer choice that aligns with the question's requirement of enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server is T1071-Application Layer Protocol. This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C&C server, which could include HTTPS. Therefore, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the JavaScript file was created to discover IP address information.
