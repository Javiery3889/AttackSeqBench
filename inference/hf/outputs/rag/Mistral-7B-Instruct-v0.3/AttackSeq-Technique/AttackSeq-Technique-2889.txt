 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the Tactic is Command and Control, which is often used for establishing communication between the attacker and compromised systems.
3. Among the answer choices, T1090.002-External Proxy, T1498-Network Denial of Service, and T1106-Native API do not directly relate to communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
4. T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which includes HTTP and HTTPS. Therefore, it is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after discovery techniques and manipulation of thread contexts.
