 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Inception Framework exploited RTF files using CVE-2014-1761 for initial access, which aligns with the Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
2. After gaining initial access, the attacker needs a method to communicate with their cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control operations.
3. The related TTPs do not suggest any phishing (T1566) or exfiltration (T1048.003, T1102.002) activities at this stage.
4. The remaining answer choice, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control, which is a common method for maintaining communication between the attacker and compromised systems.
5. Therefore, it is most likely that T1071-Application Layer Protocol was used to facilitate communication with the cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control operations.
