 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique used to communicate data with Command and Control servers after Dridex has employed heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques.
2. The related TTPs mention Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS, which suggests that Dridex might use DNS for Command and Control communication. However, this technique is not specific enough as it only refers to DNS usage, not application layer protocols.
3. Another related TTP is Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001-Data Obfuscation, which indicates that Dridex has used data obfuscation techniques. This could be a hint that the data being communicated is encrypted.
4. The question also mentions encrypted POST requests, which are application layer protocols.
5. Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible as it encompasses various application layer protocols, including HTTP for POST requests, which could be used for encrypted communication.
6. T1622-Debugger Evasion, T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding, and T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations are not directly related to the communication of data with Command and Control servers via encrypted POST requests.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1497.003-Time Based Evasion (to evade detection)
   - T1001-Data Obfuscation (to obfuscate data)
   - T1071.004-DNS (to establish a connection with Command and Control servers)
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (to communicate data via encrypted POST requests)
