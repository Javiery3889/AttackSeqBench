 Final Answer: T1071.001-Web Protocols

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Derusbi malware gathered host and system information and before the malware's communication traffic to the C2 using obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the tactics involved are Command and Control and Data Obfuscation. However, the tactic Command and Control is more relevant to the question as it deals with the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which includes the C2 server and the obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

3. Out of the given answer choices, T1071.001-Web Protocols is the technique that best aligns with the question. This technique involves using web protocols for command and control, which fits the description of obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

4. T1129-Shared Modules, T1008-Fallback Channels, and T1036-Masquerading are techniques that do not directly relate to the communication between the malware and the C2 server, making them less likely to occur in the sequence described in the question. T1001-Data Obfuscation, while related to the question, does not specify the type of data being obfuscated, and it is not necessarily related to the communication phase. Therefore, T1071.001-Web Protocols is the most plausible answer.
