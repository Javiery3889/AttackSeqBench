 Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about data exfiltration after SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys. This indicates that the data was sent from the compromised system (SparrowDoor) to the attacker's command and control (C&C) server.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves sending exfiltrated data back to the attacker's C&C server, which aligns with the sequence of events described in the question.

3. The other answer choices do not provide a sequence of events that align with the question. T1055-Process Injection is about injecting malicious code into a legitimate process, which does not directly relate to data exfiltration. T1518.001-Security Software Discovery is about discovering security software on the target system, which does not seem to be related to the data exfiltration process.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the data exfiltration process in this scenario is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
