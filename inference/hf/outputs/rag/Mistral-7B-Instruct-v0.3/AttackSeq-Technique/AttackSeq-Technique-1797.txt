 Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic is involved, specifically through spear-phishing techniques (T1566).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1218.013-Mavinject is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic, which typically occurs after initial access has been established.
   - B: T1566-Phishing is the Initial Access tactic that involves sending a targeted email with a malicious attachment or link, which aligns with the method used by the OceanLotus Group in the question.
   - C: T1587-Develop Capabilities is a pre-attack tactic and doesn't directly relate to the initial access phase.
   - D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates is a technique under the Initial Access tactic, but it involves using legitimate digital certificates to gain access, which doesn't seem to be the method used in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access was gained.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic is involved, specifically through spear-phishing techniques.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566-Phishing (spear-phishing email) leading to the initial access, followed by T1218.013-Mavinject (Defense Evasion) if the attacker uses this technique after gaining access.
   - Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing.
