 Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitates uploading files via FTP to the C2 server after the XAgent app collects information on an iOS device.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the tactics involved are Exfiltration and Command and Control.
3. Among the answer choices, only T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is related to the transfer of files, which aligns with the exfiltration of collected data from the XAgent app.
4. T1105 is also related to the Command and Control tactic, as it involves the transfer of tools or data to the C2 server.
5. T1204-User Execution, T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS, and T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism are not directly related to the uploading of files via FTP to the C2 server.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1020-Automated Exfiltration (collecting information), T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrating the collected data), and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (uploading the collected data via FTP to the C2 server).
