 Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic, specifically Technique T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.

2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Initial Access, which includes the technique used to gain access to the system (T1566.001).

3. After gaining initial access, the attacker would typically move laterally within the network to find valuable data or escalate privileges (Tactic: Lateral Movement). However, the question does not provide any information about lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. The question also mentions that the stolen credentials were transmitted to C2 servers. This could be part of the Initial Access or the Command and Control (C2) tactic, but it is more likely to be part of the Initial Access tactic since the credentials were captured at this point.

5. The answer choices do not directly relate to transmitting stolen credentials to C2 servers, but they do relate to the capture and use of credentials.
   - T1528-Steal Application Access Token is about stealing access tokens for cloud-based resources, which is not directly related to the given scenario.
   - T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule is about manipulating email systems to forward emails, which is not related to the capture of user credentials.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal is about hiding or removing indicators of compromise, which is not related to the capture of user credentials.

6. The remaining answer choice, T1056-Input Capture, is about capturing keystrokes, screen content, or other input from a compromised system. This technique is often used in spearphishing attacks to capture credentials entered by the victim, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access)
- T1056-Input Capture (Initial Access)
- T1041-Account Discovery (Initial Access)
