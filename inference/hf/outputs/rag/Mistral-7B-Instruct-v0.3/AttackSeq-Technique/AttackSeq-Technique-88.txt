 Final Answer: T1560.002-Archive via Library

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the malware gathered system information, keystrokes, and directory listings, before exfiltrating the data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Collection (Tactic) and Exfiltration (Tactic). More specifically, it mentions T1560-Archive Collected Data, which is about storing collected data for later use.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1562-Impair Defenses is about preventing or impairing the victim's ability to detect or respond to the attack. It doesn't directly relate to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1119-Automated Collection is about collecting data automatically, which could be before or after archiving the data. However, the question specifies that the data has already been gathered.
   - T1547.012-Print Processors is about exfiltrating data through print spooler services, which is a method of exfiltration, but it doesn't seem to be a logical step after archiving the data.
   - T1560.002-Archive via Library is about storing the collected data in a library for later use, which aligns well with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. After gathering the data, the malware would likely archive it before exfiltrating it.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Gather System Information (T1086), Gather Keystrokes (T1084), Gather Directory Listings (T1087), Archive Collected Data (T1560.002), and then Exfiltrate Data (T1041).
