 Final Answer: B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the technique that facilitates keeping control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Collection (T1074.002) which involves staging data remotely, and the Tactic of Command and Control (T1104) which is about maintaining communication with the compromised system.
3. Among the answer choices, T1218.015-Electron Applications, T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, and T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services do not directly relate to maintaining control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages.
4. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is the technique that best aligns with the question as it involves using multiple stages to communicate with the compromised system, allowing the attacker to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1074.002 (Remote Data Staging) -> T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (Maintaining control through multiple communication stages) -> T1086 (Command and Control) -> (Exfiltration).
