 Final Answer: A: T1137-Office Application Startup

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of SBDH malware, which downloads a backdoor and a data stealer. This aligns with the Tactic: Execution.
2. The question asks for the technique employed to ensure the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited on the infected system.
3. Among the answer choices, T1137-Office Application Startup is the technique that specifically targets Microsoft Office applications, which aligns with the requirement of the question.
4. T1078.001-Default Accounts, T1559.001-Component Object Model, and T1119-Automated Collection are techniques that do not directly relate to the execution of malware within Microsoft Office applications.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1204.002 (Malicious File download) -> T1137 (Office Application Startup).
