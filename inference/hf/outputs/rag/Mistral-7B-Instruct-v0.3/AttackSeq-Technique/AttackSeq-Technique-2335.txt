 Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurs when Cinobi communicates with its C&C server over the Tor proxy.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the Tactic: Command and Control is mentioned, which suggests that Cinobi is communicating with its C&C server.
3. The Technique: T1090-Proxy is related to using a proxy to communicate with the C&C server, which aligns with the question's requirement of communication over a Tor proxy.
4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the communication between Cinobi and its C&C server over a proxy. T1542.002-Component Firmware is about manipulating firmware, T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS is about using dynamic DNS services to make it difficult to identify and track command and control servers, and T1566-Phishing is about sending fraudulent emails with the goal of inducing the recipient to reveal sensitive information.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Cinobi uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials (T1568.001 and T1185).
   - Cinobi communicates with its C&C server over the Tor proxy (T1090).
   - The C&C server responds by downloading additional malware stages and configuration files.
