 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if T9000, after executing through an RTF file and multi-stage shellcode, is likely to use sideloading a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) and setting registry keys to inject ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the tactics of Persistence and the technique of T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading. This technique involves sideloading a malicious DLL through a legitimate executable.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question and the related TTPs both involve the persistence tactic and the use of DLL sideloading. The question asks if T9000 will use these techniques, and the related TTPs confirm that T9000 could potentially use DLL sideloading (T1574.002) for persistence. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T9000 executes through an RTF file and multi-stage shellcode (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1192 - Exploit Public Facing Application)
   - T9000 sideloads a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) through a legitimate executable (igfxtray.exe) (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading)
   - T9000 sets registry keys for persistence (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547 - Modify Registry)
   - T9000 injects ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.003 - Run as Service)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if T9000 will use methods such as sideloading a malicious DLL and setting registry keys for persistence.
   - The related TTPs mention the tactics of Persistence and the technique of DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002).
   - Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that T9000 will use DLL sideloading (T1574.002) and setting registry keys for persistence.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
