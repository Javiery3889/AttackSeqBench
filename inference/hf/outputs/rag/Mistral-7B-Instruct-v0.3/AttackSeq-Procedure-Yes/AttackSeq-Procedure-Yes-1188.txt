 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls before a macro downloads malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure, given that initial access was gained by embedding malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a spear-phishing attack (T1566.001) using a malicious file (T1204.002). This suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the victim's system and is now looking to execute further actions, such as downloading malicious payloads from their C2 infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the victims would be instructed to disable security controls before the macro downloads malicious payloads. In many cases, attackers may attempt to disable security controls to ensure that their malicious activities are not detected. This aligns with the TTPs provided, as the attacker has gained initial access and is now looking to execute further actions on the compromised system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given the initial access was gained through a spear-phishing attack, the attacker has control over the malicious document.
   - To ensure the successful execution of their malicious payload, the attacker may instruct the victim to disable security controls, such as antivirus or firewall, before the macro downloads the malicious payloads from their C2 infrastructure.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) -> T1204.002 (Malicious File) -> T1086 (PowerShell) or T1055 (Remote File Copy) -> T1070 (Disable Security Controls) -> T1059 (Command and Control) -> T1086 (PowerShell) or T1055 (Remote File Copy) -> T1203 (Internal Related Resource) -> T1059.001 (User Execution) -> T1056 (Scheduled Task/Job) or T1053 (System Services) -> T1087 (Boot or Logon Initialization Script) -> T1088 (Data from Local System) or T1003 (Data from Local System).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
