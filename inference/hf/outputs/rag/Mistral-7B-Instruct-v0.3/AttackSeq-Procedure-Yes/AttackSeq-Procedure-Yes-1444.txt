 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The Taidoor malware has been modified and downloaded using a decryptor to avoid detection, which indicates that it is a multi-stage attack (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).
2. In a multi-stage attack, the initial stage (the downloader) may not communicate with the command-and-control servers directly. However, the final stage (the Taidoor variant) is expected to communicate with the command-and-control servers.
3. The Taidoor malware is known to use non-standard ports for communication (T1571-Non-Standard Port), which means it can communicate with command-and-control servers using ports other than the standard ones.
4. The question asks if the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw. Since the Taidoor malware is known to use command-and-control servers and it has been modified, it is likely that the new variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers mentioned in the question.
5. Bidirectional Communication (T1102.002) is a technique where the malware both sends and receives data from the command-and-control server. Since the question does not specify the direction of communication, it is not necessary to consider this technique in this case.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
- Taidoor malware is downloaded and decrypted by a downloader (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels)
- The new Taidoor variant communicates with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw (T1571-Non-Standard Port).
