 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects after abusing PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Privilege Escalation (T1546) and Persistence (T1546) tactics, with the specific technique being Component Object Model Hijacking (T1546.015). This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in COM objects to execute malicious code.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about establishing persistence after abusing PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager. The related TTPs suggest that the attackers might use Component Object Model Hijacking for both Privilege Escalation and Persistence. Since the question is about persistence, the most relevant technique from the related TTPs is T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking for Persistence.

4. The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects before concealing execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading. The related TTPs suggest that the adversaries might use Component Object Model Hijacking for persistence, but they do not mention reflective code loading. However, it is possible that the adversaries could use another technique for concealing the execution of malicious payloads, such as T1035 - Process Injection or T1055 - DLL Search Order Hijacking. Therefore, while the question asks about two steps, the answer provided only addresses the first step of establishing persistence.

In conclusion, it is likely that the adversaries will establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects (T1546.015), but the question does not provide enough information to definitively say whether they will also conceal execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading.

Final Answer: Yes (for the first part of the question).
