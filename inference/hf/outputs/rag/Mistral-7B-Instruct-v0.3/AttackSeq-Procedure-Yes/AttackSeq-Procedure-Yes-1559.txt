 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Operation NightScout will execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory before employing defense evasion techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion techniques, specifically T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading and T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection. These techniques involve loading a DLL into memory and using native functions to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that aligns with the related TTPs. First, the attacker gains Initial Access through a supply chain attack (not directly mentioned in the related TTPs but a common precursor). Then, they execute a malicious MFC Dialog application (which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but could be a method to load the DLL). This application uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory. Afterward, the attacker employs defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions (which is directly related to T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attack campaign Operation NightScout will execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory before employing defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
