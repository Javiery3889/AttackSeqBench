 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components for achieving initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Execution and Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, and Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. However, CVE-2012-0158 is related to Microsoft Office applications, specifically Microsoft Word, and does not directly involve the execution of wab.exe or wab32res.dll.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop specific malicious components. The related TTPs do not suggest that CVE-2012-0158 is used for this purpose, and the TTPs do not mention wab.exe or wab32res.dll. Therefore, it is not likely that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop these malicious components.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is B: No. The spear phishing document is not likely to exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components such as wab.exe and wab32res.dll for achieving initial access.
