 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM will execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs, and then employ techniques to evade defense measures after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing attack (T1566.001) using malicious files (T1204.002). However, the TTPs do not specify any specific techniques for executing malicious code or evading defense measures.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. The most plausible sequence would be:
   - Initial Access (T1566.001) - Gain access to the system through a spearphishing attack.
   - Execution (T1204.002) - Execute the malicious code delivered through the malicious files (RTF and Excel).
   - Command and Control (T1086) - Establish communication with the command and control server to receive further instructions, which could involve deploying Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, and RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok.
   - Defense Evasion (T1027) - Employ techniques to evade defense measures, such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access (T1566.001) - Gain access to the system through a spearphishing attack with malicious files (RTF and Excel).
   - Execution (T1204.002) - Execute the malicious code delivered through the malicious files.
   - Command and Control (T1086) - Establish communication with the command and control server to deploy Trojans and RATs.
   - Defense Evasion (T1027) - Employ techniques to evade defense measures, such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that ProjectM will execute malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy as well as RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok before employing techniques to evade defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.
