 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to have archived collected data before using a Trojanized VNC Uploader for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Lazarus group is known to use Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data, and Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility. These TTPs suggest that the Lazarus group does indeed archive collected data using various utilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events before using a Trojanized VNC Uploader for exfiltration. The related TTPs indicate that the Lazarus group archives data before exfiltration. Therefore, it is plausible that they would archive data before using a Trojanized VNC Uploader for exfiltration.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data (or T1560.001-Archive via Utility) followed by Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
