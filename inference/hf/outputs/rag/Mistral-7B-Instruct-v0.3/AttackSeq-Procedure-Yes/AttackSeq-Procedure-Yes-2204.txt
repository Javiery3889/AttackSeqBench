 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will collect data from local systems and network shared drives during the Collection phase before compressing this data using WinRAR for subsequent exfiltration via the megacmd tool.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is likely to perform Collection activities, specifically T1005-Data from Local System and T1560-Archive Collected Data. T1560.001-Archive via Utility suggests that the data collected will be archived using a utility, which aligns with the use of WinRAR mentioned in the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Discovery phase. The Discovery phase TTPs (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) are not directly related to the Collection or Exfiltration phases. However, the Collection phase TTPs (T1005 and T1560) are directly related to the activities described in the question (collecting data from local systems, compressing data using WinRAR). Therefore, it is likely that the attacker will perform these Collection TTPs before exfiltrating the data, as suggested by the use of the megacmd tool.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Earth Lusca will collect data from local systems and network shared drives during the Collection phase before compressing this data using WinRAR for subsequent exfiltration via the megacmd tool. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
