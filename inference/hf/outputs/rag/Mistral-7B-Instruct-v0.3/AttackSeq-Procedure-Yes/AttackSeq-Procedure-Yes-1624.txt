 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT28 (a known Advanced Persistent Threat group) is likely to deploy additional modules for data collection after performing discovery and identifying vulnerable systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves data collection (Tactic: Collection) and exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration). Specific techniques mentioned are T1005-Data from Local System (collection of data from the local system) and T1020-Automated Exfiltration (automated transfer of data from the target to an external location). T1119-Automated Collection is also mentioned, but it is not directly related to the question as it refers to the automated collection of data from various sources, not specifically the exfiltration of stolen data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the deployment of a module (pr.dll) for data exfiltration. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that APT28 would deploy such a module as part of their data collection efforts, especially since T1020-Automated Exfiltration is mentioned.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules for data collection after performing discovery and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves data collection (Tactic: Collection) and exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration).
   - Given that T1020-Automated Exfiltration is mentioned, it is plausible that APT28 would deploy a module like pr.dll for data exfiltration as part of their data collection efforts.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
