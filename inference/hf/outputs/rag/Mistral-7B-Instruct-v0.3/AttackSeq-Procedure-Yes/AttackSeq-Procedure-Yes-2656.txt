 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Korplug malware collects data from removable media (T1025) and local systems (T1005). This suggests that Korplug is capable of data collection from various sources. However, the absence of T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) in the related TTPs does not necessarily mean that Korplug does not use this technique.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not specify that Korplug will only proceed with data exfiltration if it has used T1041 in the past. Given that Korplug is a malware known for data collection and the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is plausible that it could use an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol for data exfiltration, as suggested in answer choice A.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Korplug malware will proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
