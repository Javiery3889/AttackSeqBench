 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the actors are involved in reconnaissance activities (T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, T1596.002-WHOIS) and initial access through drive-by compromise (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs related to reconnaissance (T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, T1596.002-WHOIS) suggest that the actors are gathering information about their targets before launching an attack. The TTP for initial access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) suggests that they will use this information to execute their attack, such as spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks. Therefore, it is plausible that they would gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
