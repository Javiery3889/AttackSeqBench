 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control and that it exfiltrates data over the C2 channel (T1041). However, the specific technique for exfiltration is not specified.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about using a HTTP GET request, but the related TTPs do not specify this method for exfiltration. Instead, they indicate that the exfiltration occurs over the C2 channel, but the technique for this is not specified. Since the question asks about a specific method (HTTP GET), and the related TTPs do not confirm this, it is more likely that the Smooth Operator malware will not automatically exfiltrate collected data via a HTTP GET request.

Therefore, the answer is B: No.
