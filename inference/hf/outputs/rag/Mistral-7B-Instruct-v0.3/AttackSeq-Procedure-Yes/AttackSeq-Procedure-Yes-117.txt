 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after Agrius has exploited public-facing applications for initial access and uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Persistence, which is the ultimate goal of an attacker after gaining initial access and moving laterally within a network.
3. The Technique T1505.003 refers to the use of a web shell for persistence, which aligns with the previously mentioned TTP of uploading webshells for lateral movement.
4. The Technique T1543.003 refers to the creation of a Windows service for persistence, which is a common method for maintaining access to a compromised system.
5. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a custom malware, and deploying it for execution before registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems would be a logical sequence of TTPs for an attacker aiming to maintain persistence and further compromise the network.
6. Therefore, it is likely that Agrius will deploy the custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, for execution before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.
