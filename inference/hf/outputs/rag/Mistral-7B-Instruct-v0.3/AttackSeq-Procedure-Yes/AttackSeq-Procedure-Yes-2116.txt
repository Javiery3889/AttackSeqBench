 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the A41APT campaign established persistence and performed internal network scanning after executing malicious payloads through DESLoader using DLL side-loading and fileless implants.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1053) and the Technique of Scheduled Task (T1053.005). This technique is often used to establish persistence on a compromised system by registering scheduled tasks that mimic legitimate Windows tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the execution of malicious payloads, which is a common precursor to establishing persistence. The related TTPs suggest that the A41APT campaign might have used the Scheduled Task technique (T1053.005) to establish persistence. After persistence is established, the next logical step would be to perform internal network scanning to search for open RDP and SMB ports for credential access, as mentioned in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the A41APT campaign established persistence by registering scheduled tasks that mimicked legitimate Windows tasks (T1053.005) before performing internal network scanning to search for open RDP and SMB ports for credential access. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
