 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SideWinder APT group used exploits from the C&C server, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation before employing techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190). This aligns with the question's context of the SideWinder APT group exploiting CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs: Initial Access (T1190) -> Privilege Escalation (T1068) -> Defense Evasion (T1027, T1036, T1055). The related TTPs indicate that the group might have used exploits for privilege escalation (T1068), which aligns with the use of CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU mentioned in the question. After privilege escalation, it is likely that the group would employ techniques to evade detection, such as obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation (T1027, T1036, T1055).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The SideWinder APT group initially gained access through exploiting CVE-2019-2215. It is plausible that they would then use additional exploits, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation. After gaining higher privileges, they would likely use techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection, making the answer "Yes".
