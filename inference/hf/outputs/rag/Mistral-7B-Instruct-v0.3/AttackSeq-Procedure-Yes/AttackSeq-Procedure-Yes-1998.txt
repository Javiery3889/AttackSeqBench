 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Scr.js performs discovery tasks and saves the output to a temporary file. The question asks if it is likely that Scr.js will drop the scheduled task PolicyConverter before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is used with the Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task, and the Tactic of Execution is used with Techniques T1059.007-JavaScript and T1053.005-Scheduled Task. This suggests that the threat actor may use a scheduled task for persistence and JavaScript for execution, but it does not necessarily mean that the scheduled task will be dropped before it executes the specified file.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if Scr.js will drop the scheduled task PolicyConverter before it executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js. The related TTPs do not provide information that supports this sequence of events. In fact, the TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task is typically used for persistence, meaning the scheduled task would be created after the initial execution of the malware (Scr.js in this case), not before.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the scheduled task PolicyConverter will be created after Scr.js performs its discovery tasks and saves the output to a temporary file, and it will execute the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code at a later time, not before. Therefore, the answer is No.
