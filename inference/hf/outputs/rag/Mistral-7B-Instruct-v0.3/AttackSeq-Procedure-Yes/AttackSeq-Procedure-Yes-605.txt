 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access before abusing command and script interpreters to execute malicious scripts or binaries.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the Initial Access tactic (T1133-External Remote Services), which typically refers to the initial step in an attack where an attacker gains access to a system. This is followed by the Execution tactic (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter), which involves the use of command and script interpreters to execute malicious scripts or binaries.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Initial Reconnaissance (DOCKERGEDDON), and the related TTPs suggest that the next logical step would be Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services) followed by Execution (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter). Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

In summary, after utilizing DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance, it is likely that attackers will exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access, and then abuse command and script interpreters to execute malicious scripts or binaries.
