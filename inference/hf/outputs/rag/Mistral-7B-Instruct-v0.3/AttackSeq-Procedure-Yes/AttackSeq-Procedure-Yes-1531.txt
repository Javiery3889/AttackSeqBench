 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the installer of Etumbot malware, after being delivered via spear phishing emails, will drop the backdoor named sysupdate.exe before achieving persistence by creating a registry file to modify startup behaviors.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is relevant, specifically the Technique T1547.001, which involves modifying registry run keys or startup folder. However, the Tactic of Initial Access, Technique T1566.001, which is spear phishing attachment, is not directly related to the persistence technique mentioned.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial access, and the related TTPs suggest that persistence is the next likely step. However, the question does not mention the creation of a registry file for persistence before dropping the backdoor named sysupdate.exe. Therefore, it is more likely that the malware would first achieve persistence (T1547.001) before dropping the backdoor (which would be part of the Command and Control (C2) phase).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the installer will drop the backdoor named sysupdate.exe before achieving persistence by creating a registry file to modify startup behaviors. Therefore, the answer is "No".
