 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the LODEINFO malware will inject malicious code into a svchost.exe process during execution using Native API techniques, after delivering the malware via spear phishing emails and before ensuring persistence through adding values to the Run registry.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Privilege Escalation (T1055) and Defense Evasion (T1055-Process Injection). Process Injection is a technique used to run a malicious process inside another legitimate process, which can help evade detection and gain higher privileges.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs include Process Injection, which is a technique used for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion. Injecting malicious code into a svchost.exe process would be a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it allows the attacker to run the malicious code with higher privileges and evade detection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs include Process Injection, which is a technique used for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion.
   - Injecting malicious code into a svchost.exe process would be a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it allows the attacker to run the malicious code with higher privileges and evade detection.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the LODEINFO malware will inject malicious code into a svchost.exe process during Execution using Native API techniques.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
