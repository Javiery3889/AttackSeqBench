 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel, after collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data, will enumerate data directories to discover files of interest and collect GPS information before automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Collection is involved, specifically the Technique T1074.001-Local Data Staging, which refers to the adversary staging data on the compromised system. Additionally, the Tactic of Discovery is also mentioned, with the Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which refers to the adversary discovering files and directories on the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial collection of files. The related TTPs suggest that the adversary may further discover files and directories of interest, which aligns with the action of enumerating data directories to discover files of interest. This sequence is followed by the collection of GPS information, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a common practice for adversaries to gather additional information about the target. Finally, the question asks about the exfiltration of these files, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a common follow-up action after collection and discovery. However, the use of Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration is not explicitly stated in the question, but it is a known technique used by adversaries for secure data transfer.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel will enumerate data directories to discover files of interest and collect GPS information before automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections. Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the adversary will first enumerate data directories to discover files of interest (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) and then collect GPS information (not explicitly mentioned in the TTPs but a common practice). However, the use of Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration is not explicitly stated in the question or the related TTPs, but it is a known technique used by adversaries for secure data transfer. Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that the exfiltration will be done using these methods, it is plausible that the sequence of TTPs will be: Enumerate data directories, Collect files of interest, Collect GPS information, and Exfiltrate files (using Tor hidden service and SSH connections, although not explicitly stated). Final Answer: Yes.
