 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Infamous Chisel's netd component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactic is Discovery and the technique is T1083-File and Directory Discovery. This technique involves the enumeration of files and directories, not the collection of files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the collection phase, but the related TTPs do not suggest that the netd component of Infamous Chisel is designed to automatically collect files during this phase. The TTPs only indicate that it is used for discovery, not collection. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "No".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the netd component will collect files during the collection phase.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the netd component is used for discovery, not collection.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the netd component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase. Final Answer: B: No.
