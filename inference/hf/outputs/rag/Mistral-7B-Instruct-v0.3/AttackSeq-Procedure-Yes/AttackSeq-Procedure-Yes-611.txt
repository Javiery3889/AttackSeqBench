 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will employ certain tools for Initial Access after performing Reconnaissance using specific tools.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Discovery, specifically Remote System Discovery (T1018) and Network Service Discovery (T1046).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The initial Reconnaissance phase involves discovering services and potential targets. After successfully discovering potential targets, it is plausible for the attacker to move on to the next phase, Initial Access, by identifying internal hosts (T1018) and remotely controlling software (T1046) using tools like Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package. The question also mentions that the attacker has already used tools for brute force authentication, which is a common method for Initial Access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attacker will employ Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for identifying internal hosts and remotely controlling software during Initial Access before attempting to evade defenses using AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
