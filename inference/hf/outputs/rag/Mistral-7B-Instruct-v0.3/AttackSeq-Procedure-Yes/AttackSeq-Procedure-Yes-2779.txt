 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the phishing emails sent by TA453's campaign included a link leading to their controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through spearphishing links (T1566.002). This technique is often used to trick victims into clicking a malicious link, which could lead to the attacker's controlled domain.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the actor-controlled Gmail account was used to send phishing emails. The related TTPs suggest that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing link, which aligns with the sequence of events described in the question. Therefore, it is likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to the TA453-controlled domain before the domain presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the phishing emails included a link leading to the TA453-controlled domain before the domain presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
