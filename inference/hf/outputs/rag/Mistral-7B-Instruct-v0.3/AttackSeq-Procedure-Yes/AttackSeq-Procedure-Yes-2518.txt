 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the BlueDelta campaign is likely to perform system information discovery by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software before utilizing Roundcube’s managesieve plugin to collect emails by auto-forwarding them to an actor-controlled email address.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application), and the collection of local emails (T1114.001-Local Email Collection) and email forwarding (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule) were performed. However, there is no mention of system information discovery or exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities for this purpose.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs that involves system information discovery, exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities, and then email collection. However, the related TTPs only mention initial access, local email collection, and email forwarding, which do not align with this sequence. The most plausible sequence based on the provided information is: Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) -> Local Email Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection) -> Email Forwarding (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the BlueDelta campaign would perform system information discovery by exploiting Roundcube webmail software before utilizing Roundcube’s managesieve plugin to collect emails by auto-forwarding them to an actor-controlled email address. The final answer is "No".
