 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a phishing email to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension, which is an Initial Access technique (T1566).
2. The related TTPs provided also mention Initial Access techniques (T1566), which suggests that the attack sequence is likely to involve more Initial Access techniques.
3. Once the threat actors have gained initial access through the FriarFox malware, it is plausible that they would establish a connection with a command and control (C2) server to receive further instructions or payloads. This is a common tactic in many attack sequences and is represented by the Tactic: Command and Control (T1086).
4. The Scanbox payload is not mentioned in the question, but it is a known malware used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. Given that the question mentions the possibility of receiving a payload, it is likely that the threat actors would use the C2 connection to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which is another Initial Access technique (T1078).
5. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is likely that the threat actors will use the FriarFox malware to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.
