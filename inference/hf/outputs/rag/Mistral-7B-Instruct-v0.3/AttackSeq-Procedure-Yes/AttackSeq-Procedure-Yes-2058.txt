 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts before facilitating further lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers initially accessed the system (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts) and persisted on the system (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts). Lateral Movement was also performed (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol). However, there is no indication that domain administrator passwords were compromised.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of compromised domain administrator passwords, but the related TTPs do not suggest this activity. The attackers gained access to the system and moved laterally using other means, but there is no evidence of password compromise. Therefore, it is not likely that they used compromised domain administrator passwords.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the attackers used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts before facilitating further lateral movement.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers initially accessed the system and moved laterally, but there is no indication of password compromise.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that they used compromised domain administrator passwords, so the answer is B: No.
