 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over the application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel, given that system information discovery and screen capture capabilities have been employed.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has employed T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which is a technique used to transfer stolen data back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, which are often used in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. After gathering this information, it is likely that the attacker would establish communication with the C2 server (T1071 - Application Layer Protocol) to receive further instructions or to set up the data exfiltration channel. Once the communication is established, the attacker can then exfiltrate the data through the same C2 channel (T1041).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1071 - Application Layer Protocol (Establish communication with C2 server)
- T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Exfiltrate data through the same C2 channel)

Since the question asks if it is likely that these TTPs will occur in this sequence, the answer is "Yes".
