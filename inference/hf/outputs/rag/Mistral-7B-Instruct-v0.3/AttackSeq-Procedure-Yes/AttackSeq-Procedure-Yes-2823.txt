 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server, which is a Tactic known as Command and Control (T1057). The communication uses RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding, which are techniques related to Command and Control (T1057.001 and T1057.002).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Exfiltration (T1041), which is the tactic of stealing data from a compromised system. One of the techniques for Exfiltration is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041.003).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel. Given that BlackSoul is communicating with a C2 server, and the related TTPs include Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, it is plausible that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1057.001 (Command and Control: RESTful Strapi protocol)
   - T1057.002 (Command and Control: JSON-based encoding)
   - T1041.003 (Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)

Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
