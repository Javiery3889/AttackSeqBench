 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after CosmicDuke, a malware known for using document-based exploits and MiniDuke loaders, has been executed.
2. The related TTPs mention Exfiltration (T1020) and Collection (T1056.001) techniques.
3. T1056.001, Keylogging, is a technique used for collecting information, specifically keystrokes.
4. The question also mentions screenshotting and clipboard stealing, which are other methods of information collection.
5. The question then asks if CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers for exfiltration and updating, which aligns with the Exfiltration (T1020) technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
6. Therefore, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would collect information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing before communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.
7. The answer choice that aligns best with this sequence is "Yes".
