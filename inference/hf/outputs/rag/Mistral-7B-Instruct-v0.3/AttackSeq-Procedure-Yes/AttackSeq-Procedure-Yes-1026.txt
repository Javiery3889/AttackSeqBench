 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware has already performed T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which includes scanning local files and directories. Additionally, the Tactic: Collection is mentioned, which suggests that the malware is gathering data. The Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive specifically mentions network shared drives, which implies that the malware is capable of scanning these drives for data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the malware has already demonstrated the ability to discover files and directories (T1083) and that it is known to collect data (Tactic: Collection), it is plausible that it would also scan network shared drives (T1039) for sensitive data as part of its data collection activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. Based on the related TTPs, it is plausible that the malware would perform this action, as it has already demonstrated the ability to discover files and directories (T1083) and is known to collect data (Tactic: Collection). Therefore, the final answer is Yes.
