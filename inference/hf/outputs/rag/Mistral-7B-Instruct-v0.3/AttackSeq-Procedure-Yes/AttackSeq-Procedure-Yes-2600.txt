 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: NanHaiShu is gathering system information from infected machines, which aligns with the Discovery tactic (T1082).
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (C2) tactic (T1071) and the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001).
3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Discovery (T1082) - Gathering system information
   - Command and Control (T1071) - Communicating with C&C servers (HTTP POST and HTTP GET)
   - Command and Control (T1071) - Downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code

The sequence suggests that after gathering system information, NanHaiShu would communicate with C&C servers (T1071) using HTTP POST and HTTP GET, and then download and execute JScript and VBScript code. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.
