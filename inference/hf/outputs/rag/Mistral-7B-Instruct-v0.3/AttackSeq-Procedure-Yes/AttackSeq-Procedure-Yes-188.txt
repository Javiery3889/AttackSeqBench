 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to enumerate system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery before automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services, after deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is focusing on the Tactics of Exfiltration and Discovery, and the Technique of T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that Infamous Chisel would first perform Discovery (T1083) and then Exfiltration (T1020). However, the question does not provide any indication that Infamous Chisel is known to perform Discovery before Exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice suggests that Infamous Chisel would not perform Discovery before Exfiltration. This aligns better with the question, as there is no indication in the question that Infamous Chisel is known to perform Discovery before Exfiltration.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is not likely to involve Discovery (T1083) before Exfiltration (T1020) with Infamous Chisel.
