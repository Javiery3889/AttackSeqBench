 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Russian-speaking cybercriminals will download remote administration tools after gaining initial access through malicious attachments or web-links via spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing (T1566) and spear-phishing attachment (T1566.001). These TTPs are part of the Initial Access tactic, which is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the execution phase, which typically follows the initial access phase. During the execution phase, attackers often download and install tools to maintain persistence and perform further actions, such as credential theft. Remote Administration Tools (RATs) are common tools used for this purpose. Given that the initial access was gained, it is likely that the attackers would proceed to the next step, which is downloading and installing RATs.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Russian-speaking cybercriminals will download programs for remote administration tools to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
