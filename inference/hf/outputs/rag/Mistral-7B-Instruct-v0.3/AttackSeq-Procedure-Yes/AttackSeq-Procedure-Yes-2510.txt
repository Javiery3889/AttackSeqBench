 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the GreyEnergy group using SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and collecting credentials using Nmap and Mimikatz.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement and the Technique of T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, which involves transferring tools to other systems to perform lateral movement.

3. The Tactic of Credential Access and Technique T1003.001-LSASS Memory, which involves collecting credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory, is also provided. However, this technique is not directly related to the question about lateral movement.

4. Given that the attacker has already compromised a system, collected credentials, and has the TTP of Lateral Tool Transfer, it is likely that they will use these credentials to transfer and execute tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement across the compromised network. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
