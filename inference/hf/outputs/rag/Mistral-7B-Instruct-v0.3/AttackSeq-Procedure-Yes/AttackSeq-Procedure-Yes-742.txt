 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools as part of the execution phase before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using T1059.003-Windows Command Shell for execution, T1590-Gather Victim Network Information for reconnaissance, and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the malware downloader has already gained initial access. The TTP T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is often used for executing binaries, which aligns with the question's first part about executing binaries. The TTP T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is related to reconnaissance, which aligns with the question's second part about conducting reconnaissance. However, the question does not specify the tool used for this reconnaissance, but the TTP T1590 is still relevant because it suggests that the attacker will conduct reconnaissance at some point. The TTP T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is not directly related to the question, but it does suggest that the attacker may transfer additional tools, which could include the 'bird.exe' mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions that the malware downloader has gained initial access and is likely to execute binaries. The TTP T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is used for executing binaries, so it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries, including possibly downloading and executing reconnaissance and RAT tools.
   - The question also mentions that the attacker will conduct reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'. While the TTP T1590-Gather Victim Network Information does not specify the tool used for reconnaissance, it does suggest that the attacker will conduct reconnaissance at some point. It is possible that the 'bird.exe' is one of the tools downloaded and executed during the execution phase, which aligns with the question's sequence of events.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools as part of the execution phase before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'. Final Answer: A: Yes.
