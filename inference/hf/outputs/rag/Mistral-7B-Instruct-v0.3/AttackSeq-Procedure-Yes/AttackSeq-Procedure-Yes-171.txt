 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: 'Surtr' is discovered to have created folders for storing temporary information, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection and Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that 'Surtr' is involved in data collection and discovery.
3. Compare and Evaluate: After collecting data, it is a common tactic for an attacker to communicate with a command and control server (C2) to download additional components or receive further instructions. This action aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control (C2) and Technique: T1057-Command and Control (C2) for downloading a stage two component.
4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that 'Surtr' will connect to a command and control server (C2) and download a stage two component to a specific directory. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.
