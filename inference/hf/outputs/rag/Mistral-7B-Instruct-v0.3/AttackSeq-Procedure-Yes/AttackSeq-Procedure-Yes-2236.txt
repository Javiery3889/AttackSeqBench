 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten (an assumed threat actor) will establish communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server after gaining access to additional accounts through a keylogger (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the threat actor has already gained access to additional accounts through a keylogger. This action is often followed by further actions such as establishing communication with a C&C server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications, as these actions are common tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the threat actor would establish communication with a C&C server to further their attack, so the answer is "Yes".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Rocket Kitten will establish communication with a C&C server after gaining access to additional accounts through a keylogger.
   - The related TTPs suggest that this sequence of events is common in cyber attacks, as gaining access is often followed by further actions such as establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Rocket Kitten will establish communication with a C&C server, so the final answer is "Yes".
