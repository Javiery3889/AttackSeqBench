 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic, after decoding and executing the appropriate base64 encoded blob during the execution phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Defense Evasion (Tactic) and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Technique T1140) and Dynamic-link Library Injection (Technique T1055.001). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using obfuscation techniques to hide their malicious intent and is injecting a DLL into a legitimate process to execute their payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001), which is a technique used to execute code in memory by injecting a DLL into a legitimate process. Therefore, it is likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Defense Evasion (Tactic) and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Technique T1140) and Dynamic-link Library Injection (Technique T1055.001).
   - The attacker is using obfuscation techniques to hide their malicious intent and is injecting a DLL into a legitimate process to execute their payload.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection (T1055.001).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
