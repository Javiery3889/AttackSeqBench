 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT10, after using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control and transferring data using tools like Robocopy and PSCP, is likely to push data from victim networks to other networks they have access to and then pull the data to their own C2 servers for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041) and the Technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Additionally, the question also mentions Lateral Movement (T1021) with a specific technique T1021.004, which is SSH.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes APT10 using tools like Robocopy and PSCP for data transfer, which aligns with the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique (T1041). Furthermore, the question mentions SSH, which is a technique under Lateral Movement (T1021), and is also a method used for data transfer between systems. This suggests that APT10 may move laterally within the network to push data to other networks they have access to, and then pull the data to their own C2 servers for exfiltration.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that APT10 would push data from victim networks to other networks they have access to and then pull the data to their own C2 servers for exfiltration. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
