 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if TG1021 (Reconnaissance) was performed before gaining initial access through a deserialization attack on internet-facing Windows IIS servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker initially accessed the system through T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), not TG1021 (Reconnaissance).

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since the initial access was gained through T1190, it is unlikely that TG1021 (Reconnaissance) was performed before this step. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
