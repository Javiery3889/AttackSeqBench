 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Darkhotel APT after initial access.
2. The initial access was achieved through seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic (T1189).
3. The question then mentions the use of 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer to execute malicious code. This is not explicitly stated in the related TTPs, but it falls under the Execution tactic (T1203) for client execution, as it involves executing malicious code on the compromised system.
4. Lastly, the question asks about maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings. This is also not explicitly stated in the related TTPs, but it can be inferred as a persistence mechanism, which is a common tactic used by APT groups to maintain access to compromised systems.
5. Given the sequence of events described in the question, it is plausible that Darkhotel APT would use 0-day exploits (T1203) after initial access (T1189) and then maintain persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
