 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign is known to use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication (T1036.003).
2. The question mentions the use of SSL-encrypted traffic, which is a common method for securing C2 communication. This aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography, as it involves the use of RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
3. After establishing secure C2 communication, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). This is a common follow-up action after a successful C2 connection, especially when the connection is secured using encryption methods like SSL and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1036.003 (Protocol Tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2)
   - T1573.002 (Asymmetric Cryptography for C2 communication)
   - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)

So, the answer is A: Yes.
