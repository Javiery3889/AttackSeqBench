 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: FIN13 is known for transferring tools into the environment, encoding data for communication during their command and control phase, and exfiltrating data. The question asks if it is likely that they would exfiltrate data over web services by using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention tactics of Persistence, Exfiltration, and the specific techniques T1505.003 (Web Shell) and T1567 (Exfiltration Over Web Service). T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) is also mentioned, but it is not directly related to the question as it refers to exfiltration over the command and control channel, not web services.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exfiltration over web services, and the related TTPs mention T1567 (Exfiltration Over Web Service). Additionally, the question mentions the use of web shells (T1505.003), which are often used to facilitate data exfiltration over web services. Therefore, it is plausible that FIN13 would exfiltrate data over web services by using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 would exfiltrate data over web services by using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
