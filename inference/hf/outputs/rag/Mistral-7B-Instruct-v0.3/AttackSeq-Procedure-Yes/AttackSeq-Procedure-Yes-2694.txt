 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Elfin, a threat actor, has established command and control (T1021) using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT. The question asks if it is likely that they proceeded to exfiltrate data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are Exfiltration (T1041 and T1048) and the technique for exfiltration is over C2 channel (T1041) or alternative protocol (T1048).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exfiltration after establishing command and control. The related TTPs also mention exfiltration. The answer choices do not provide specific details about the method of exfiltration, but the question mentions a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, which are tools designed for faster data transfer than traditional FTP clients. The use of these tools aligns with the tactics and techniques mentioned in the related TTPs, as they are methods of exfiltration over an alternative protocol (T1048).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Elfin proceeded to exfiltrate data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, as these tools are designed for faster data transfer and align with the tactics and techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
