 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FamousSparrow (a known threat actor) is likely to collect system information after dumping credentials using Mimikatz.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery tactic (T1082) is involved, which includes System Information Discovery. This suggests that the attacker may collect system information after gaining access to the system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Given that the Discovery tactic is related to the question and involves system information collection, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) to dump credentials using Mimikatz.
   - Tactic: Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery) to collect system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: First, the attacker dumps credentials using Mimikatz (T1003.001), then collects system information (T1082). Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
