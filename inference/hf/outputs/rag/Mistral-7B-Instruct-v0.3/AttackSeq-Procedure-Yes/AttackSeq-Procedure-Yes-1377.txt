 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the 'Password' module group will be used to steal credentials before the 'Spreading' module group attempts to infect other hosts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already gained initial access using Local Accounts (T1078.003), and they are performing Reconnaissance to gather initial system information (T1589.001). However, there is no indication that the attacker is currently focused on Credential Access (T1555) to steal credentials from various applications and resources.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs do not suggest that the attacker will use Credential Access (T1555) before Spreading (T1026). Instead, the sequence seems to be Initial Access (T1078.003) -> Reconnaissance (T1589.001) -> Credential Access (T1555) (if necessary) -> Spreading (T1026). However, the question asks for the sequence before Spreading, so the correct answer is that the Password module group is not likely to be used before the Spreading module group.

Therefore, the final answer is No. The Password module group is not likely to be used to steal credentials before the Spreading module group attempts to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.
