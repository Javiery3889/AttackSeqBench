 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels. This technique often involves using multiple stages to communicate with the C&C server, which can include encrypted channels.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Command and Control phase, and the related TTPs suggest that encrypted communication is a possibility during this phase. Therefore, it is plausible that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The backdoor has been used for Discovery and Collection, gathering machine information and taking screenshots.
   - During the Command and Control phase, the attacker would typically issue commands to the compromised system.
   - The related TTP T1104-Multi-Stage Channels suggests that the attacker may use multiple stages to communicate with the C&C server, which can include encrypted channels.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.
