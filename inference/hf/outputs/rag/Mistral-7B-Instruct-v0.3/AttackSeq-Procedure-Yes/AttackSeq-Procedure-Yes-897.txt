 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an Office document containing KerrDown will have an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File. This TTP refers to the use of malicious files to execute malicious code. It does not mention the use of image files or instructions to enable macros before executing the payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the presence of an image file and instructions to enable macros, but the related TTP does not suggest these steps. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the presence of an image file and instructions to enable macros, but the related TTP (T1204.002-Malicious File) does not suggest these steps. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload. Final Answer: B: No.
