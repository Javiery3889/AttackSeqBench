 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor, after compromising SolarWinds and delivering it through a supply-chain attack, will communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control and the Technique of T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique involves using web protocols for command and control communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Command and Control is about maintaining persistence and controlling compromised systems. The Technique of T1071.001-Web Protocols is a method used for this purpose, which aligns with the question's context of communication between the Sunburst backdoor and its C2 server.

   The Initial Access Tactic (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain) is related to the initial compromise of SolarWinds, but it does not directly answer the question about further communication between the Sunburst backdoor and its C2 server.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is more plausible that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol, as indicated by the TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols. So, the answer is "Yes".
