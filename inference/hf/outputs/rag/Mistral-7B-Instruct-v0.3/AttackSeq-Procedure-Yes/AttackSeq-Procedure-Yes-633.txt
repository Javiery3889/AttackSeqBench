 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C and resolve the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91 for further malicious activity, after privilege escalation using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Privilege Escalation (Tactic) using techniques such as Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001) and Process Injection (T1055). However, there is no mention of Command and Control (Tactic) or Domain Name System (DNS) resolution (T1102) in the question or related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the shellcode contacting a C&C or resolving a domain after privilege escalation. The related TTPs do not suggest that these activities are likely to occur after the described privilege escalation techniques. Therefore, it is not likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the provided URL or resolve the domain to the IP address for further malicious activity.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the shellcode will contact its C&C and resolve a domain after privilege escalation.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that these activities are likely to occur after the described privilege escalation techniques.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the provided URL or resolve the domain to the IP address for further malicious activity.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
