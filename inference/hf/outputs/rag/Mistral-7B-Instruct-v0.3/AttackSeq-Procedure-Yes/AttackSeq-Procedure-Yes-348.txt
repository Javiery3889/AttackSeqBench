 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors would gain knowledge about systems and the internal network using Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques before employing techniques to gain elevated permissions under the Privilege Escalation tactic, after they have executed code during the Execution phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Discovery techniques (T1007-System Service Discovery and T1012-Query Registry) and Privilege Escalation technique (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation). These TTPs suggest that the threat actors are likely to gather information about the system and network first, before attempting to escalate their privileges.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question would be:
   - Execution (T1053-Command and Scripting Interpreter) to execute code.
   - Discovery (T1007-System Service Discovery and T1012-Query Registry) to gather information about the system and network.
   - Privilege Escalation (T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) to gain elevated permissions.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes. The threat actors would likely gain knowledge about systems and the internal network using Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques before employing techniques to gain elevated permissions under the Privilege Escalation tactic.
