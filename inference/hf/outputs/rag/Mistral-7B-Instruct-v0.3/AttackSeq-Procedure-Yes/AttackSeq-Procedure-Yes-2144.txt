 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the malware is likely to perform process discovery and establish command and control through Process Hollowing after achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Process Hollowing (T1547.001) for communication with the C2, but there is no mention of process discovery (T1087) in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs only mention Process Hollowing. Since process discovery is not mentioned in the related TTPs, it is less likely that the malware will perform process discovery before establishing command and control through Process Hollowing.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the malware is not likely to perform process discovery before establishing command and control through Process Hollowing. Therefore, the answer is "No".
