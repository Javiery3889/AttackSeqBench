 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) and Non-Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control (T1095). These TTPs suggest that the attacker first establishes a connection with the C&C server and then exfiltrates data through this channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before data exfiltration. The related TTPs suggest that this sequence is likely to occur, as the attacker first establishes a connection with the C&C server (T1095) and then exfiltrates data (T1041). Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

In summary, based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that Korplug will communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.
