 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the FlowCloud malware will execute 'Gup.exe', which in turn executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence, after the Execution tactic where the FlowCloud macro renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using a version of certutil.exe (Temptcm.tmp).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using Defense Evasion (T1036.005) to match legitimate names or locations, and Execution (T1059.003) to use the Windows Command Shell. The Persistence tactic (T1547) is also mentioned, but it is not clear yet if it has been executed.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the Persistence tactic (T1547). After successfully executing the malicious 'gup.exe' using the Execution tactic (T1059.003), it is likely that the malware will perform additional actions to maintain persistence on the compromised system. One such action could be executing 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to install payload file components, as mentioned in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the FlowCloud malware will execute 'Gup.exe', which in turn executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
