 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an adversary will execute custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage web services after collecting data from an information repository.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Exfiltration (Tactic) and Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (Technique T1567.002). This suggests that the adversary is likely to use cloud storage services for data exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the adversary will execute custom-built malware for exfiltration. While the question does not explicitly state that the malware will be used for exfiltration, the related TTPs suggest that the adversary is using cloud storage for data exfiltration, which is a common technique for malware. Therefore, it is plausible that the adversary will use custom-built malware for this purpose.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the adversary will execute custom-built malware to exfiltrate the processed files to cloud storage web services after collecting data from an information repository. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
