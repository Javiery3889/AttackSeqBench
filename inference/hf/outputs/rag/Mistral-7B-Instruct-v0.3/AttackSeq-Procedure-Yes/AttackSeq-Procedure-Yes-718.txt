 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers after performing initial reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control (T1071) and the Technique of Web Protocols (T1071.001). This suggests that the implant may use web protocols for communication, which includes HTTP.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about communication with control servers, and the related TTPs suggest that the implant might use web protocols for this purpose. The answer choice A: Yes aligns best with this information, as it implies that the implant would communicate with control servers via HTTP, which is a web protocol.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the implant might use web protocols for Command and Control, which includes HTTP.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
