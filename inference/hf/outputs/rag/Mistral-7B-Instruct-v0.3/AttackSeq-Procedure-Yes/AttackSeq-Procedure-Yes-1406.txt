 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers, after impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages, will use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using tactics like Resource Development (T1586) to compromise accounts, and Defense Evasion (T1656) by impersonation. Resource Development T1586.002 specifically mentions email accounts, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting email credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question. The attackers first impersonate technical support or friends (T1656-Impersonation), then use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials (T1586-Compromise Accounts, T1586.002-Email Accounts), and finally lock out the original owners by changing account passwords (implied in the question).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using tactics like Resource Development (T1586) to compromise accounts, and Defense Evasion (T1656) by impersonation.
   - Resource Development T1586.002 specifically mentions email accounts, which aligns with the question's mention of collecting email credentials.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
