 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an adversary, after identifying privileged users, would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the adversary is involved in Collection activities (T1114-Email Collection) and Discovery activities (T1124-System Time Discovery). The Collection TTP specifically mentions email collection, and the presence of T1114.001 suggests that the collection could be local.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about collecting email messages from both local and remote systems. The related TTPs suggest that the adversary is indeed collecting emails (T1114) and the TTP T1114.001 indicates that local email collection is possible. However, the question does not specify whether the collection is limited to local systems. Since the question asks about both local and remote systems, it is reasonable to assume that the adversary could extend their email collection activities to remote systems as well.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
