 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13, after obtaining credentials, will gather information on services and move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 has used techniques like T1556 (Modify Authentication Process) to obtain credentials, specifically through process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries. This suggests that FIN13 has gained access to the system and has the necessary credentials to perform further actions.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about gathering information on services and moving laterally in the network. The MITRE ATT&CK framework does not explicitly list system service discovery (T1087) as a technique used by FIN13. However, after gaining access to the system, it is plausible that FIN13 would want to gather information about the services running on the system to identify potential targets for lateral movement.

   Moving laterally in the network is a common tactic for advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like FIN13, and the use of WMI (T1027) and custom web shells (T1055) for this purpose is well-documented.

   Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 would perform system service discovery (T1087) after obtaining credentials, but this is not explicitly stated in the related TTPs. However, the use of WMI (T1027) and custom web shells (T1055) for lateral movement suggests that FIN13 would likely move laterally in the network after gathering information about services.

   Therefore, the answer is "Yes". FIN13 is likely to gather information on services and move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.
