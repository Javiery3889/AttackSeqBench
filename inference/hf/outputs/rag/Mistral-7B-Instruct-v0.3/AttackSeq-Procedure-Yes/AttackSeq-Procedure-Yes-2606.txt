 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malware gathers system information and uploads it to a C&C server. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in both data collection and exfiltration activities. Specifically, it is using T1005-Data from Local System for collection and T1020-Automated Exfiltration for exfiltration. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is also related, as it suggests that the exfiltration is happening over a command and control channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the T1020-Automated Exfiltration tactic, which involves the use of automated scripts for data exfiltration. The malware has already uploaded system information, which could be considered an initial phase of data collection (T1005). Given that the malware is communicating with a C&C server, it is likely that it will receive and execute additional scripts (JScript and VBScript) for exfiltrating sensitive data, as suggested by T1041.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1005-Data from Local System (Collection)
- T1020-Automated Exfiltration (Exfiltration)
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Exfiltration)

And the malware will likely receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data. So, the final answer is "Yes".
