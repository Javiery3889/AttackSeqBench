 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Taidoor malware will upload files to the C&C server for data exfiltration after it communicates with the C&C server using RC4 encryption and the victim's MAC address as an encryption key.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique refers to the exfiltration of data through the command and control channel, which is typically used for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. However, it does not necessarily imply that the malware will automatically upload files after encrypting communication with the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the malware's behavior related to data exfiltration. The fact that the malware uses RC4 encryption and the victim's MAC address as an encryption key suggests that it is communicating with the C&C server, but it does not necessarily mean that it will upload files for data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question does not provide enough information to definitively say that the malware will upload files for data exfiltration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No". It is possible that the malware may perform data exfiltration at a later stage, but based on the information provided, it is not likely to do so immediately after encrypted communication with the C&C server.
