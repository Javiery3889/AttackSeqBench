 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant will use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages after performing data discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. However, there is no mention of using a custom protocol for data exfiltration, compression, or encryption.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific method of data exfiltration (custom protocol, compressed, and encrypted messages), but the related TTPs do not provide any information about this specific method. The TTPs only mention the general technique of exfiltration over a C2 channel. Therefore, it is not likely that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant will use the described method of data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about a specific method of data exfiltration (custom protocol, compressed, and encrypted messages), but the related TTPs do not provide any information about this specific method.
   - The TTPs only mention the general technique of exfiltration over a C2 channel, which does not necessarily involve a custom protocol, compression, or encryption.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant will use the described method of data exfiltration. Final Answer: B: No.
