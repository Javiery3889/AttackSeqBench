 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will use Command and Scriptting Interpreter (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter) to invoke PowerShell commands after gaining initial access through a malicious Word document using the DDE technique (T1184-Dynamic Data Exchange). The question also mentions creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry, and connecting to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the Execution tactic, specifically T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, which is used to execute scripts or commands, and T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange, which is used to gain initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will use Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands. The related TTPs suggest that this is a likely step in the attack sequence, as Command and Scripting Interpreter is used to execute scripts or commands. Additionally, the question mentions creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry, and connecting to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware. These steps are not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but they are common tactics in an APT attack, and the use of Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands could be a means to achieve these steps.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will use Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands after gaining initial access through a malicious Word document using the DDE technique.
   - The related TTPs suggest that this is a likely step in the attack sequence, as Command and Scripting Interpreter is used to execute scripts or commands.
   - It is also likely that the APT28 threat actor will use PowerShell commands to download a file, create persistence through a batch file and registry entry, and connect to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware, as these are common tactics in an APT attack.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
