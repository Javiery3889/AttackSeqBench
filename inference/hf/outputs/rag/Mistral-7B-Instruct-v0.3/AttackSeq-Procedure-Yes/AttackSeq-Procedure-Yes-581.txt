 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use commands to discover remote systems before moving laterally using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool, given that they have already used Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory and Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) to obtain credentials, Defense Evasion (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) to bypass authentication, and Lateral Movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) to move from one system to another.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about discovering remote systems before moving laterally. The related TTPs do not explicitly mention this step, but the Lateral Movement technique (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) implies that the threat actors will move from one system to another using the obtained credentials. However, before moving laterally, it is likely that the threat actors would want to identify other systems they can access with the stolen credentials. This process can be achieved by discovering remote systems, which aligns with the question's context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if threat actors will use commands to discover remote systems before moving laterally.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Credential Access, Defense Evasion, and Lateral Movement.
   - While the Lateral Movement TTP does not explicitly mention discovering remote systems, it is likely that the threat actors would want to identify other systems they can access with the stolen credentials before moving laterally.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the threat actors will use commands to discover remote systems before moving laterally using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
