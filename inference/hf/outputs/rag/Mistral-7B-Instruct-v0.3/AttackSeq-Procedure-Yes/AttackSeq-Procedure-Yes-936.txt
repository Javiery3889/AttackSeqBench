 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a backdoor program will establish communication with the C2 server after gathering host information following successful evasion techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using T1071.004 - DNS Tunneling for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - First, the attacker successfully evades detection (Tactic: Evasion).
   - Then, the attacker gathers host information (Tactic: Discovery).
   - Afterward, the attacker establishes a backdoor on the compromised host (Tactic: Persistence).
   - Finally, the backdoor program communicates with the C2 server using DNS tunneling (T1071.004 - DNS Tunneling).

Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor program will establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling and communicate to receive commands.
