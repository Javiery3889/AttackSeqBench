 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor will attempt to gather information from the victim's machine, including usernames, as part of its system reconnaissance activities before performing tasks related to high-level collection like file searching or metadata gathering.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Aria-body loader has established persistence on the victim's machine, which is a tactic under the Persistence category. This suggests that the attacker intends to maintain access to the system for future activities. The Discovery category is also mentioned, which involves gathering information about the system to understand its layout and capabilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Discovery category (Tactic: Discovery) includes T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which involves the attacker searching for files and directories on the victim's machine. However, usernames are not typically considered part of file or directory information. Instead, usernames are more closely related to the Initial Access and Discovery categories, as they help the attacker understand the system's user accounts. Since the Aria-body backdoor has already established persistence, it is likely that it will perform system reconnaissance activities, including gathering usernames, before moving on to high-level collection tasks like file searching or metadata gathering.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the Aria-body backdoor will attempt to gather information from the victim's machine, including usernames, as part of its system reconnaissance activities before performing tasks related to high-level collection like file searching or metadata gathering. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
