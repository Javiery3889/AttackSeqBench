 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if MSIL/Crimson, after successfully executing on the victim's machine, is likely to utilize a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its command and control (C&C) servers before relying on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware may use Command and Control (T1071.001) and potentially a non-application layer protocol (T1095). Additionally, it mentions that exfiltration may occur over the C2 channel (T1041).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP T1071.001 - Web Protocols suggests that the malware might use a web protocol for communication with its C&C servers. However, the term "custom TCP protocol" in the question implies a protocol that is not standard or well-known, which is not explicitly mentioned in T1071.001. T1095 - Non-Application Layer Protocol could potentially fit this description, as it refers to using non-standard protocols for C2 communication. T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware may use the C2 channel for data exfiltration, but it does not necessarily imply the sequence of events in the question.

   Given that the question asks about a sequence of events, the most plausible answer would be that the malware first establishes communication with its C&C servers using a custom TCP protocol (T1095), and then proceeds to exfiltrate data over this C2 channel (T1041). This sequence aligns with the question's requirement of communication before data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events after MSIL/Crimson successfully executes on the victim's machine.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware may use a custom TCP protocol for communication (T1095) and exfiltrate data over the C2 channel (T1041).
   - Given the sequence requirement in the question, it is most plausible that the malware first establishes communication with its C&C servers using a custom TCP protocol (T1095), and then proceeds to exfiltrate data over this C2 channel (T1041).
   - Final Answer: Yes (the malware will utilize a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its command and control servers before relying on the RAT component for information exfiltration).
