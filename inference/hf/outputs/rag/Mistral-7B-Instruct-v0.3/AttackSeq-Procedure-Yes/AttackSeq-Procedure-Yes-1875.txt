 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: FIN13 is using ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution. The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1505) and specifically the Technique of T1505.003 - Web Shell. This technique involves establishing a persistent command-and-control channel to a remote server by creating a script on a web server that can be executed by a web browser. Additionally, the question mentions the Tactic of Credential Access (T1003) and the Technique of T1003.001 - LSASS Memory, which is used to gain credentials from the LSASS process memory.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTPs suggest that FIN13 is interested in establishing persistence and gaining credentials. Deploying a web shell (T1505.003) on an external server would allow FIN13 to maintain persistence and potentially gain access to the victim network. The use of LSASS Memory (T1003.001) could be a means to an end, as it provides a way to obtain credentials that could be used to authenticate to the web server hosting the web shell. Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN13 is using ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory, which is a technique used to gain credentials (T1003.001).
   - FIN13 is also executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which suggests they have initial access to the victim system.
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1505) and specifically the Technique of T1505.003 - Web Shell. This technique would allow FIN13 to maintain persistence and potentially gain access to the victim network.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks (Answer: A).
