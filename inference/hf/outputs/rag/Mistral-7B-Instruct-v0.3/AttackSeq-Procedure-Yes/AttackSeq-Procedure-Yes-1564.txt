 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules after establishing communication using HTTP cookie headers for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control, and it is also impersonating protocols or services (T1001.003). These TTPs suggest that the malware is communicating with the C&C server and possibly impersonating a legitimate service to do so.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the malware will communicate with the C&C server to receive commands and modules. The related TTPs indicate that the malware is already communicating with the C&C server (T1071.001). Additionally, the malware is using encrypted communication methods, as implied by the use of T1001.003 (Protocol or Service Impersonation), which is often used to evade detection. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will continue to communicate with the C&C server to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules after establishing communication using HTTP cookie headers for defense evasion.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control, and it is also impersonating protocols or services (T1001.003).
   - Given that the malware is already communicating with the C&C server (T1071.001) and using encrypted communication methods (implied by T1001.003), it is likely that the malware will continue to communicate with the C&C server to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
