 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if BlueBravo is likely to gather victim system information after establishing persistence.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that BlueBravo is associated with the Discovery tactic, specifically the T1082 technique, which involves System Information Discovery.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The T1082 technique is related to gathering system information, which includes details like username, computer name, Windows version, and list of running processes. Since BlueBravo is associated with this technique, it is likely that BlueBravo will gather this information after establishing persistence.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Tactic: Persistence (establishing persistence by creating registry run keys to execute malware during system startup)
- Tactic: Discovery (gathering victim system information including username, computer name, Windows version, and list of running processes)

Hence, the answer is "Yes".
