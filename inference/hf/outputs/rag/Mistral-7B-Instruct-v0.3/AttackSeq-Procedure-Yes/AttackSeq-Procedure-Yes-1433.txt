 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM actors would utilize domains to host C2 servers after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the actors have used techniques for Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and Resource Development (T1583.001-Domains). Additionally, the Execution technique T1204.002-Malicious File is not directly related to the question, but it is a common technique used in the attack chain.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. The TTP T1583.001-Domains (Resource Development) is related to setting up infrastructure, such as C2 servers, which is a common step after initial access. Therefore, it is likely that the actors would utilize domains to host C2 servers before delivering payloads.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if ProjectM actors would utilize domains to host C2 servers after gaining initial access.
   - The related TTP T1583.001-Domains (Resource Development) is related to setting up infrastructure, such as C2 servers.
   - Therefore, it is likely that ProjectM actors would utilize domains to host C2 servers before delivering payloads.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
