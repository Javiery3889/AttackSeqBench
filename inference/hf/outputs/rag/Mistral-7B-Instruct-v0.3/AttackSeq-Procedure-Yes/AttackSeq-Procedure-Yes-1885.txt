 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: FIN13 is known to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. The question asks if it is likely that they will employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1505) and the Technique of T1505.003 - Web Shell. This technique involves establishing a foothold on a compromised system by deploying a web shell, which allows an attacker to execute commands remotely. However, it does not provide long-term persistence.

   The question also mentions the Tactic of Command and Control (T1104) and the use of multi-stage channels. This suggests that FIN13 may use multiple methods to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of a web shell (T1505.003) for initial access is a common TTP for FIN13. However, it does not provide long-term persistence. To maintain control, it is likely that FIN13 would employ additional methods, such as a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, which can listen for incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This would provide a more stealthy and persistent method of control.

   After establishing a passive backdoor, FIN13 could then use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to further entrench themselves in the system, as these tools are used for maintaining persistence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 would employ a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
