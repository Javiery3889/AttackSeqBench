 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Rising Sun implant is likely to use T1071.001-Web Protocols for communication with control servers and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery for discovery activities. However, there is no mention of fetching computer name and user name information in these TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about fetching computer name and user name information, but the related TTPs do not indicate this activity. The TTPs only mention communication methods and discovery techniques, not the specific data that is being discovered or fetched. Therefore, it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about fetching computer name and user name information, but the related TTPs do not indicate this activity.
   - The TTPs only mention communication methods and discovery techniques, not the specific data that is being discovered or fetched.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
