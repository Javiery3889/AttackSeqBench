 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after compromising the Enterprise Admin account.
2. The related TTPs include Defense Evasion (T1078) and Lateral Movement (T1021.002, T1570).
3. Defense Evasion TTP is often used to avoid detection by using built-in tools like PSExec and plink.exe, which are mentioned in the question.
4. Lateral Movement TTP is used to move within a network, and the question mentions the use of SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002) and Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570), which are common methods for lateral movement.
5. The question also mentions the manipulation of bank employee credentials and customer debit cards, which could be considered a form of Privilege Escalation. However, there is no specific Privilege Escalation TTP mentioned in the related TTPs.
6. Since Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement are common steps in an attack sequence, and the question mentions tools often used for Defense Evasion, it is likely that the attackers adopted these tactics before attempting to manipulate bank employee credentials and customer debit cards.
7. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
