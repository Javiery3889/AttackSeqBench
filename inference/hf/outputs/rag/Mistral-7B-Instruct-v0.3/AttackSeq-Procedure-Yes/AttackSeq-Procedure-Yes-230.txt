 Final Answer: Yes (A)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group, after executing an encrypted backdoor in memory, is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control (T1104) and the technique of Multi-Stage Channels, which suggests that the attacker uses multiple stages to communicate with the command and control server. This indicates that the attacker intends to maintain communication with the backdoor for further commands.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the backdoor will connect to command and control servers. The related TTPs suggest that this is a likely sequence of events, as the attacker has used a technique (T1104) that is associated with command and control communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Lazarus group has executed an encrypted backdoor in memory for defense evasion (T1218.011-Rundll32).
   - After executing the backdoor, it is likely that the backdoor will connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities, as this is the purpose of a backdoor and is supported by the related TTP of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.
   - Final Answer: Yes (A)
