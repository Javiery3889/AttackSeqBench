 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol, which refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control communication. This technique is used to establish a covert channel between the attacker and the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Command and Control phase, and the related TTPs provide information about a technique used during this phase for command and control communication. The technique mentioned, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, is a method for transferring data over application layer protocols. Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers will use this technique to receive the stolen data from the compromised devices.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers will use an application layer protocol to receive the stolen data from the compromised devices during the Command and Control phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
