 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Korplug to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols and Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol. These TTPs suggest that Korplug may use various methods for command and control communication, including web protocols and non-application layer protocols. However, the specific use of HTTPS for the initial handshake and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the specific sequence of TTPs, and while the related TTPs do not provide explicit evidence for the sequence in the question, they do suggest that Korplug may use command and control communication methods, which could include HTTPS for the initial handshake and encrypted communication over TCP. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is A: Yes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.
   - The related TTPs suggest that Korplug may use various command and control communication methods, but do not provide explicit evidence for the sequence in the question.
   - However, it is plausible that Korplug, like many malware, may use HTTPS for the initial handshake to blend in with normal web traffic and then switch to encrypted communication over TCP for subsequent data transfer.
   - Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
