 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten (an advanced persistent threat group known for using spear-phishing emails) will employ spear-phishing emails containing malicious payloads for initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Initial Access tactic and the Spearphishing Attachment technique (T1566.001) under Initial Access. This indicates that Rocket Kitten is known to use spear-phishing emails as a means of initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question also mentions the use of simple and advanced tools during execution, and debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion. These TTPs are not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but Rocket Kitten is known to use a wide range of tools and techniques for execution and defense evasion, so it is plausible that they would use these as well.

4. Conclusion: Given that Rocket Kitten is known to use spear-phishing emails for initial access (as indicated by the related TTPs), and they are also known to use a wide range of tools and techniques for execution and defense evasion, it is likely that they would employ spear-phishing emails containing malicious payloads for initial access before using both simple and advanced tools during execution, and later use debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
