 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain during command and control communication after using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (Command and Control) and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading (Persistence and Defense Evasion). However, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels does not specify a specific domain for command and control communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs provided do not directly indicate that the malware will connect back to the specified domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) during command and control communication. The T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading technique is used to load malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection, and T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is used to communicate with the command and control server, but it does not necessarily have to be the specified domain.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The malware may use various methods for command and control communication, and the provided question does not indicate that it will connect back to the specified domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org). Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
