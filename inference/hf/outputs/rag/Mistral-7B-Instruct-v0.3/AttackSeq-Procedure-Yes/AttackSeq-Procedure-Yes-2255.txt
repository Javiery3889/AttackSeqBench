 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1036.005 (Match Legitimate Name or Location) and T1656 (Impersonation). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using decoys and honeytraps (impersonation) to blend in with legitimate systems and evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker first targets a specific group (military personnel) using decoys and honeytraps, then moves on to target another group (government personnel in India) to gather identity information. After that, the attacker is expected to mimic the infection chains of another APT group (Sidewinder APT) to develop their own malware for espionage. This sequence aligns with the TTPs provided, as the attacker is using Defense Evasion techniques (T1036.005 and T1656) to blend in and evade detection while targeting different groups and developing their own malware.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
