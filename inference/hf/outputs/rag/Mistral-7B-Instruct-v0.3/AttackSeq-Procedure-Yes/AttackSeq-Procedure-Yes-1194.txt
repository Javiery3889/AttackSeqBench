 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server after creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe" on every system boot.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, which suggests the use of web protocols for command and control communication. However, the TTPs also mention the Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder and T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, which are techniques used to ensure persistence on a compromised system. These techniques do not directly imply an immediate connection to a C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a connection to a specific C&C server after creating a LNK file for persistence. The related TTPs do not provide evidence that this connection will occur immediately or even at all after the persistence mechanism is set up. The TTP T1071.001 suggests the use of web protocols for command and control, but it does not necessarily mean that this will happen immediately after the persistence mechanism is set up.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information immediately after creating a LNK file for persistence. The connection to the C&C server and the command and control communication are likely to occur at a later stage, possibly after the system has been compromised and the persistence mechanism has taken effect.
