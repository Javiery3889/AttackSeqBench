 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the script 'stopedge.bat' will contribute to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) and Execution (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell, T1053.005-Scheduled Task). These TTPs suggest that the attacker might use scheduled tasks for persistence and command shell for execution. However, the question does not mention any scheduling of 'install.vbs'.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question specifically asks about scheduling 'install.vbs', but the related TTPs do not indicate that 'stopedge.bat' will schedule 'install.vbs'. The deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion (T1082) does not inherently imply the creation of a new scheduled task for persistence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if 'stopedge.bat' will schedule the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'. The related TTPs do not suggest that this will happen, so the answer is B: No.
