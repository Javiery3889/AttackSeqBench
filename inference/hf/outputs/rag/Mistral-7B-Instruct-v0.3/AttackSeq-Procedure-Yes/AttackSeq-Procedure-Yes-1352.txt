 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves exploitation for client execution (T1203) and the use of a malicious file (T1204.002). Spear-phishing attachment (T1566.001) is also mentioned, which is the initial access technique used in this attack.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial access. The TTPs related to the question suggest that the attack will involve the execution of a malicious file (T1204.002), which is likely to be the Flash exploit 'show.swf'. This file would execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes (T1203) as part of the exploitation process. After executing the shellcode, it is possible for the attacker to evade defenses by embedding a payload in an animated GIF image (T1204.003, not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but a common technique for evading defenses).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.
