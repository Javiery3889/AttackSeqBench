 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish, attackers will deploy Cobalt Strike and use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Execution (T1047) and the Technique of Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047-WMI). However, they do not mention the Tactic of Discovery (T1087) or the specific techniques like T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) or any other command-line tools like Cobalt Strike or PowerShell.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions Cobalt Strike, PowerShell, and specific command-line tools like "whoami", "net user", and "net group". However, the related TTPs do not provide any evidence to support the use of these tools in the sequence mentioned in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish, the attackers will subsequently deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and proceed to use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.
