 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish command and control (C&C) servers after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using techniques associated with the Command and Control tactic (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and Initial Access tactic (T1189-Drive-by Compromise). However, the Command and Control tactic is also mentioned again in the related TTPs, suggesting that the attackers will likely continue to use this tactic after initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the establishment of C&C servers after initial access. The related TTPs suggest that the attackers are likely to continue using Command and Control tactics, which includes establishing C&C servers. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

In summary, the Elderwood Project attackers are likely to establish command and control servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.
