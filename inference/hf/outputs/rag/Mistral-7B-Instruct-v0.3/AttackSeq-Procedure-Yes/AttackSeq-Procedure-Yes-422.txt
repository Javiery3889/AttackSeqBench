 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of adversaries using encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver obfuscated malware for defense evasion after installing malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla.
2. The related TTPs provided mention Technique T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File and Technique T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information, both of which are defense evasion techniques.
3. Emotet and Agent Tesla are malware used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, and using encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver obfuscated malware is a common tactic for defense evasion, making it difficult for security solutions to detect and block the malware.
4. Therefore, it is likely that adversaries will use encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver obfuscated malware for defense evasion after installing malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla.
