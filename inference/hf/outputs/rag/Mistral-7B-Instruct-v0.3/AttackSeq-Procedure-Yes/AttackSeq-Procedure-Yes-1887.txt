 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FIN13, after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance before using WMI for lateral movement across the victim network.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 has used T1078.002 (Domain Accounts) for credential access, T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation) for execution (lateral movement), and T1003.001 (LSASS Memory) for credential access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about internal reconnaissance (gathering information on user accounts) before lateral movement (using WMI). The TTPs provided show that FIN13 has used LSASS Memory for credential access, which aligns with the initial step of gaining credentials. The use of native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts is not explicitly mentioned in the provided TTPs, but it is a common tactic for internal reconnaissance. However, the use of WMI for lateral movement is explicitly mentioned in the TTPs. Therefore, it is plausible that FIN13 would gather information on user accounts using native OS binaries and scripts before using WMI for lateral movement.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN13 has gained credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing (T1003.001).
   - It is likely that FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance (not explicitly mentioned in TTPs but a common tactic).
   - After gathering information, FIN13 is likely to use WMI for lateral movement across the victim network (T1047).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
