 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from a specific IP address before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol, given an initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the attack involves client-side execution (T1203) and exploitation (T1059.007), which aligns with the initial access through weaponized RTF documents. The Command and Control TTP (T1105) is also mentioned, which suggests that the attacker will establish command and control over the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial access. The initial access is achieved through T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (T1059.007), which is the first step. After successful exploitation, the malware (MSIL/Crimson) would execute on the victim's machine, which is the second step. The malware then attempts to download the full RAT component from a specific IP address, which is the third step. Finally, the malware establishes command and control using a custom TCP protocol, which is the fourth step.

The answer choices do not provide a sequence of events, but based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:

- Initial Access: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (T1059.007)
- Execution: MSIL/Crimson malware execution
- Ingress Tool Transfer: Download of the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001
- Command and Control: Establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
