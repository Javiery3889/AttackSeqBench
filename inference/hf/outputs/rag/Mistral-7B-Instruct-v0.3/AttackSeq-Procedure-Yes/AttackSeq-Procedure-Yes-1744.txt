 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 removed all disk-resident tools after employing a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics of Defense Evasion are being used, specifically Technique T1070.004 (File Deletion) and T1027.005 (Indicator Removal from Tools). These techniques suggest that the attacker is trying to hide their presence by deleting files or removing indicators of their tools from the system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the removal of all disk-resident tools, not just indicators or specific files. While T1027.005 (Indicator Removal from Tools) could be a part of the attack sequence, it does not necessarily imply the removal of all disk-resident tools. On the other hand, T1070.004 (File Deletion) could potentially include disk-resident tools, but it is not specific to them.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if all disk-resident tools were removed, and the related TTPs suggest the removal of specific files or indicators, not all disk-resident tools. Therefore, it is not likely that they demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy (Answer: B: No).
