 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution. This technique involves the attacker exploiting a vulnerability in software to execute malicious code on the target's system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using exploitation techniques for client execution. However, CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability related to Microsoft Equation Editor, not Microsoft Word. Exploiting this vulnerability would not directly lead to deploying a PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER, which is a technique more commonly associated with PowerShell-based attacks. Therefore, it is less likely that the sequence of TTPs in the question would follow this path.

In conclusion, it is not likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.
