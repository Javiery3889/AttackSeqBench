 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the 'Recon' module will collect initial system information before the 'Wnhttp' module checks Internet connectivity and obtains the external IP address of the targeted system.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery are relevant. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is discovering network-related information about the targeted system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The 'Recon' module is likely to collect system information such as browser history and cached credentials, which are not directly related to network configuration or Internet connectivity. On the other hand, the 'Wnhttp' module is specifically designed to check Internet connectivity and obtain the external IP address of the targeted system. Therefore, it is more likely that the 'Wnhttp' module will perform its task before the 'Recon' module collects system information.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the 'Wnhttp' module will check Internet connectivity and obtain the external IP address of the targeted system before the 'Recon' module collects initial system information. Therefore, the answer is "No".
