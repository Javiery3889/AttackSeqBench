 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra (a known APT group) will develop Bankshot implants after gaining initial access to Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves spear phishing (T1566.001 and T1566.002), exploitation (T1203), and potentially, Resource Development (T1087) if the attackers develop and deploy implants.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the development of Bankshot implants, which is a known tool used by Hidden Cobra for maintaining persistence and gaining full control over victim systems (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1055). Given that Hidden Cobra has already gained initial access to the target systems, it is plausible that they would develop and deploy Bankshot implants to maintain persistence and further control the systems. This would also align with the Tactic of Resource Development (T1087), as the implants would be a resource developed by the attackers.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and potentially wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
