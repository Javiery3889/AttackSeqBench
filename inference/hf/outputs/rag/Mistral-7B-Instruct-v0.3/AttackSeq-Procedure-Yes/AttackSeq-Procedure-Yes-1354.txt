 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download poisoned installers, which then execute PowerSploit scripts that subsequently download and run the Pupy backdoor as part of the campaign's execution phase, given that the NewsBeef group has gained initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the Execution tactic, specifically Technique T1204.002 (Use of Malicious File) and T1059.001 (PowerShell). This suggests that the attacker may use malicious files (T1204.002) and PowerShell (T1059.001) as part of their attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers, PowerSploit scripts, and the Pupy backdoor. The related TTPs indicate the use of PowerShell (T1059.001), which is a common tool for downloading and executing scripts. The question also mentions the use of malicious files (T1204.002), which could potentially be installers. PowerSploit is a PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework, and Pupy is a remote access trojan (RAT). Given that the attacker has gained initial access, it is plausible that they would use PowerShell to download and execute scripts, including potentially poisoned installers and PowerSploit scripts, which could then download and run the Pupy backdoor.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attack sequence includes the steps of downloading poisoned installers, executing PowerSploit scripts, and running the Pupy backdoor using PowerShell scripts. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
