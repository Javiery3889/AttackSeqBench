 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware gathers information about the infected computer, including file and directory discovery, before collecting and exfiltrating stolen HWP documents through encrypted emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is performing Collection (T1074.001-Local Data Staging) and Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs related to this question suggest that the malware first discovers files and directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) as part of the Collection process (T1074.001-Local Data Staging). This sequence of TTPs aligns with the question's scenario, where the malware gathers information about the infected computer before exfiltrating stolen files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The malware first performs T1083-File and Directory Discovery to gather information about the infected computer. After discovering the files and directories, it proceeds to T1074.001-Local Data Staging, which could include staging the HWP documents for exfiltration. Finally, it exfiltrates the stolen HWP documents through encrypted emails, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a common method for data exfiltration in many attacks. Therefore, it is likely that the malware gathers information about the infected computer, including file and directory discovery, before collecting and exfiltrating stolen HWP documents through encrypted emails.
