 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13, after using WMI and custom tools for lateral movement, will collect sensitive data, stage it, archive it, and then target specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is likely to collect data from network shared drives (T1039) and from local systems (T1005). This aligns with the question's context of collecting data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question's context suggests a sequence of actions: lateral movement, data collection, data staging, data archiving, and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. The related TTPs confirm that the attacker collects data from network shared drives and local systems, which aligns with the first two steps in the sequence. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker will perform the remaining steps as well.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question's context and the related TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 will collect sensitive data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, archive the collected data, and then target specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
