 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Machete malware to utilize screen capture as part of data collection before leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in exfiltration activities, specifically using unencrypted non-C2 protocols like FTP or HTTP. However, there is no mention of screen capture as a data collection technique in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about screen capture, but the related TTPs do not suggest that screen capture is a part of the attack sequence. The malware is known to perform discovery, produce file listings, and gather browser data, but there is no indication that screen capture is a subsequent step before using FTP and HTTP for communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely for Machete malware to utilize screen capture as part of data collection before leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers. Therefore, the answer is "No".
