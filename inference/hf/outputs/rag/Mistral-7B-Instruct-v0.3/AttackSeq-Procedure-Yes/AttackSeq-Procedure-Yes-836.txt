 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if WinDealer, which is not mentioned in the related TTPs, will communicate with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA. The question is about a specific malware (WinDealer) and its C2 communication, but the related TTPs do not mention WinDealer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography. This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography for command and control activities, but it does not specify any particular malware or malware family.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since the question is about WinDealer, a specific malware, and the related TTPs do not mention WinDealer, it is not likely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA based on the information provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about WinDealer, a specific malware, and its C2 communication.
   - The related TTPs do not mention WinDealer, but they do mention the use of asymmetric cryptography for command and control activities.
   - Since WinDealer is not mentioned in the related TTPs, it is not likely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA.
   - Final Answer: No.
