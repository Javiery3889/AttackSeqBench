 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon, after modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office, will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement and then Persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence with the Technique T1137.001 - Office Template Macros. This technique is used to establish persistence by embedding malicious macros in Office documents. The Tactic of Defense Evasion with the Technique T1112 - Modify Registry is also mentioned, which is used to bypass security software by modifying system settings.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Defense Evasion (T1112) is used to bypass security mechanisms in Microsoft Office.
   - After successfully bypassing security, it is likely that the attacker would move laterally within the compromised system to find other documents to infect (Lateral Movement). This could be achieved by exploiting the compromised system's access to other documents on the network.
   - Once the attacker has moved laterally and found suitable documents, they would then establish persistence by injecting malicious macros into those documents using the Persistence technique T1137.001.

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system for Lateral Movement before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for Persistence. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
