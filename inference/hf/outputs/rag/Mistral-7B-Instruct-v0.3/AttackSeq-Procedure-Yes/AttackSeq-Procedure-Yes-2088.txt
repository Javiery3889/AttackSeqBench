 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure after using Cobalt Strike beacon for network discovery and mapping.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement (T1570) and the Technique of Lateral Tool Transfer. This suggests that the attacker is moving from one compromised host to another within the network. The Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041) is also mentioned, which implies that the attacker is preparing to steal data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the use of Cobalt Strike beacon. The related TTPs suggest that the next logical step would be lateral movement, followed by exfiltration. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with this sequence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure targeting internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
