 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication and other actions.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction, and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion. These TTPs are related to data destruction and file deletion, which are actions typically associated with wipers or malware designed to destroy data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about data destruction or file deletion activities after the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. However, the related TTPs suggest that such activities might be expected if a data-wiping malware like 'Apostle' were to be deployed.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question does not provide evidence that Agrius deployed 'Apostle' or any other data-wiping malware after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. Therefore, it is not likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems. Final Answer: B: No.
