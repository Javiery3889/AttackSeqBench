 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about Gamaredon's activities after using an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement. The related TTPs provided indicate that Gamaredon is initially accessing the network through spearphishing attachments (T1566.001) and then moving laterally within the network (T1059.005, which uses VBA macros).

2. After gaining access and moving laterally, it is likely that the group would perform collection activities to gather sensitive information. The related TTP T1119 refers to automated collection, which suggests that the group may deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

3. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is plausible that Gamaredon would deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement.
