 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Turla will discover system network configurations via LightNeuron before using it to collect emails and exfiltrate local files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Turla is using T1114.002 for Remote Email Collection and T1016 for System Network Configuration Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: LightNeuron is a malware used for various purposes, including email collection and exfiltration. However, it does not inherently have the capability to discover system network configurations. The TTPs related to system network configuration discovery (T1016) are not among the functions that LightNeuron is known to execute (GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName). Therefore, it is more likely that Turla would perform system network configuration discovery before installing LightNeuron for email collection and exfiltration.

So, the answer is No, Turla is not likely to discover system network configurations via LightNeuron before using it to collect emails and exfiltrate local files.
