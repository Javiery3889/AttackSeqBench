 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers, after establishing a backdoor and communicating with the C&C server, leveraged its capabilities to collect detailed system information and exfiltrate the data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique of T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This indicates that the attackers have the intention and capability to exfiltrate data, and they are using the Command and Control (C&C) channel for this purpose.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about collecting detailed system information (file manipulation, screenshots, and network details) before exfiltrating the data. The TTPs suggest that the attackers have the capability to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel, which implies they could potentially collect system information and send it over the same channel.

4. Conclusion: Given the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the attackers would collect detailed system information before exfiltrating the data. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
