 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use the capability of executing malicious code through AtomBombing to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation and Technique T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call, as well as the Tactic of Defense Evasion and Technique T1055 - Process Injection. These TTPs are closely related to bypassing process-level restrictions and injecting code into trusted processes.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the likelihood of threat actors using the AtomBombing technique to perform process injection, a technique mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the question is "Yes".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation and Technique T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call, as well as the Tactic of Defense Evasion and Technique T1055 - Process Injection, which are closely related to bypassing process-level restrictions and injecting code into trusted processes.
   - Therefore, it is likely that threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique to perform process injection, making the answer "Yes" the most plausible.
