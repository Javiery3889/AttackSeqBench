 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities, given that initial access was achieved by injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the Execution tactic, specifically T1204.002 (Use of a File or Web Service to Facilitate Command and Control) and T1059.005 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using a file (Sharpshooter downloader) and a scripting language (Visual Basic) to execute commands and control the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Rising Sun implant, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question's context suggests that the Rising Sun implant is likely a second-stage payload that the attacker would download after the initial Sharpshooter downloader. This is supported by the TTP T1204.002, which describes the use of a file or web service to facilitate command and control, implying that additional files (such as the Rising Sun implant) may be downloaded for further control and execution of malicious activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using a file (Sharpshooter downloader) and a scripting language (Visual Basic) to execute commands and control the compromised system.
   - Given that the Rising Sun implant is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, it is not explicitly stated that it will download another payload. However, the context of the question and the TTP T1204.002 imply that the Rising Sun implant is likely a second-stage payload that the attacker would download after the initial Sharpshooter downloader for further control and execution of malicious activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.
