 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter after using tools like masscan and search engines such as Shodan and Censys for reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing network service discovery (T1046) and scanning databases (T1596.005). These TTPs are often used during the reconnaissance phase of an attack to gather information about the target network, including identifying open ports, services, and devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of tools like masscan and search engines such as Shodan and Censys, which are commonly used for network discovery and service enumeration. The related TTPs also indicate that the attacker is performing network service discovery. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attacker discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
