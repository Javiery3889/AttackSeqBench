 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Dridex malware will send encrypted POST requests containing data like the computer name and botnet ID to connect to proxy servers used for command and control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Dridex malware uses data obfuscation (T1001) and defense evasion techniques such as obfuscated files or information (T1027). Additionally, it is known to use proxy servers for command and control (T1090).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of obfuscation and anti-debug techniques (T1027) is a common defense evasion tactic used by malware to avoid detection. Dridex malware also uses proxy servers for command and control (T1090). Sending encrypted POST requests with data like the computer name and botnet ID to these proxy servers is a common method for malware to communicate with its command and control servers. Therefore, it is likely that Dridex malware will send encrypted POST requests containing data like the computer name and botnet ID to connect to proxy servers used for command and control.
