 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents for transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers after gathering information about the infected computer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is performing a Collection tactic (T1005) to gather data from the local system, which includes system and user names. Additionally, the Discovery tactic (T1083) is mentioned, which involves file and directory discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the collection of keystrokes, directory listings, and specific file types (HWP documents). The related TTPs suggest that the malware is already gathering data from the local system, which includes files and directories. It is plausible that the malware would also collect keystrokes and specific file types, such as HWP documents, as part of its data collection activities.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the malware will collect keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents for transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
