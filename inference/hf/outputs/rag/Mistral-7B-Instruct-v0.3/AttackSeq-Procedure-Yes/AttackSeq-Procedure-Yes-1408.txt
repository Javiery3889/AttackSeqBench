 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals, after using phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and locking out original account owners, will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are involved in Resource Development (T1586.001-Social Media Accounts, T1586-Compromise Accounts) and Impact (T1657-Financial Theft). This suggests that the attackers are interested in using the compromised accounts for malicious purposes, such as financial gain.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. After compromising the accounts, the attackers have control over them. They could use these accounts to demand ransom payments from the original owners to regain control, or they could use the accounts to perpetuate further scams, such as financial theft, which is indicated by Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft in the related TTPs.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts (collecting Instagram credentials)
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts (locking out original account owners)
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft (demanding ransom payments or perpetuating further scams)
