 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Elfin (an attacker) is likely to bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands as part of their defense evasion tactics before deploying DarkComet and a credential dumping tool.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Tactic: Credential Access, Techniques: T1056.001-Keylogging and T1552.001-Credentials In Files. These techniques do not involve PowerShell command bypass or defense evasion, but rather credential access methods.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions PowerShell command bypass, which is not related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, it is unlikely that the attacker would use PowerShell command bypass before deploying DarkComet and a credential dumping tool.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". Elfin is not likely to bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands as part of their defense evasion tactics before deploying DarkComet and a credential dumping tool.
