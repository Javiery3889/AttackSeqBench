 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform a series of actions, including creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack involves the use of Malicious Links (T1204.001), Shortcut Modification (T1547.009), and JavaScript (T1059.007). However, there is no mention of creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, or sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL in these TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific sequence of actions that is not directly related to the TTPs provided. While it is possible that the Higaisa APT group could use JavaScript as part of their attack, the sequence of actions described in the question does not align with the TTPs provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform a series of actions, including creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL. The related TTPs provided do not include these specific actions. Therefore, it is not likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform these actions. Final Answer: B: No.
