 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attacker has gained initial access via the download of an ISO file containing malicious scripts. This aligns with the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution).
2. The question then states that the attacker executes deobfuscated batch and VBScript files such as 'stopedge.bat' to schedule 'install.vbs'. This is also part of the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic).
3. The question further mentions that the attacker achieves persistence by ensuring 'install.vbs' runs every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists in the directory. This is the Persistence tactic (Tactic: Persistence) and the Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task, as the attacker schedules a task to run the script at regular intervals.
4. The Konni APT Group is known for using scheduled tasks for persistence, and the question mentions the specific TTPs related to this group, which supports the answer choice "Yes".
