 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor will ensure admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory before using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT for privilege escalation.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1547) and the Technique of Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution). However, there is no mention of Active Directory or admin privileges in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about gaining admin privileges on Active Directory, but the related TTPs do not suggest this as a likely next step after deploying a JavaScript backdoor and installing the CARBANAK RAT. The T1547 technique mentioned in the related TTPs refers to persistence mechanisms that are triggered at boot or logon, not privilege escalation.

4. The question asks about gaining admin privileges on Active Directory, but the related TTPs do not suggest this as a likely next step after deploying a JavaScript backdoor and installing the CARBANAK RAT. Therefore, the answer is No.
