 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server after achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to specific locations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Privilege Escalation (T1543.001-Launch Agent) and Defense Evasion (T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service) techniques to gain access and hide their presence on the system. The Persistence (T1543.001-Launch Agent) TTP is used to ensure the backdoor remains on the system even after a reboot. However, these TTPs do not directly indicate whether the backdoor will survey the system and send encrypted details to the command and control server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the specific actions of surveying the system and sending encrypted details to the command and control server. While the related TTPs do not directly answer this question, it is reasonable to assume that these actions are part of the OceanLotus backdoor's functionality, as these types of actions are common in advanced persistent threats (APTs) like OceanLotus.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques to gain access, persist on the system, and hide their presence.
   - While the related TTPs do not directly answer the question, it is reasonable to assume that these actions (surveying the system and sending encrypted details to the command and control server) are part of the OceanLotus backdoor's functionality.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
