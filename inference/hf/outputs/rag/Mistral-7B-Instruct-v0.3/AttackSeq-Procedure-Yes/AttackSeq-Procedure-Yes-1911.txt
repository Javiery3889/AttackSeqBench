 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will deploy tools for OS credential dumping after gaining higher-level permissions such as domain administrator.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Privilege Escalation (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) and Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Privilege Escalation TTP suggests that APT10 has gained higher-level permissions, and the Credential Access TTP indicates that they might be interested in OS credentials. DLL load order hijacking is a technique often used to execute malicious code during the loading of a legitimate DLL, which can be used to deploy tools like Mimikatz or PwDump for credential dumping. Since APT10 has already gained higher-level permissions, it is plausible that they would use these tools to further their access and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if APT10 will deploy tools for OS credential dumping after gaining higher-level permissions.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Privilege Escalation and Credential Access.
   - Given that APT10 has already gained higher-level permissions, it is likely that they would use tools like Mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping, especially since DLL load order hijacking is a technique often used in such scenarios.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
