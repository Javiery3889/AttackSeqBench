 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery after gaining execution through a Delphi downloader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention System Information Discovery (T1082) but not Process Discovery (T1057). This suggests that the focus of the attack sequence is on gathering system information, not process discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Delphi downloader is used for execution and system information gathering. The question asks about the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader, which is not mentioned in the initial execution process. Since the question does not provide any information about the AutoIt downloader performing process discovery, we cannot assume that it will do so.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is not likely that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery after the initial execution through the Delphi downloader.
