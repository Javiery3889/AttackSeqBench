 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control, given that it has already exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities and executed SparrowDoor.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique typically involves using web protocols for Command and Control, but it does not necessarily imply the use of HTTPS for communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide information about the specific communication method used by SparrowDoor. However, the use of HTTPS for Command and Control is often associated with more sophisticated malware, and it is less likely that a malware like SparrowDoor, which is typically used for initial access and execution, would use such a secure communication method.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question does not provide enough information to definitively say whether SparrowDoor uses HTTPS for Command and Control. However, based on the context and the nature of SparrowDoor, it is more likely that it would not use an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control (Answer: B: No).
