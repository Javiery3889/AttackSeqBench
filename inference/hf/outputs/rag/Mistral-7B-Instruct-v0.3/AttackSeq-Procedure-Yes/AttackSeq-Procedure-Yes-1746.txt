 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TG1021, after performing reconnaissance and gathering output files during the Discovery phase, would compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques associated with the Lateral Movement tactic, specifically T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer). These techniques are often used to move within a network and transfer tools for further attacks.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes TG1021 using tools for reconnaissance and gathering output files, which aligns with the Discovery phase. However, the related TTPs suggest that TG1021 is also known for using techniques associated with the Lateral Movement tactic. Given that the attacker has already gained access to the infected machines, it is plausible that they would use these techniques to move laterally and compromise additional servers.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
