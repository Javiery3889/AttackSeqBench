 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attack's final payload will establish a remote command shell before connecting back to the command and control server.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control and the Technique of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels. This technique often involves using multiple stages to deliver the final payload, which can include a remote command shell.
3. Compare and Evaluate: DLL side-loading is a technique used for defense evasion, but it does not inherently involve establishing a remote command shell. However, the attack sequence described in the question suggests that the encrypted payload is decrypted and executed, which could be the initial stage of a multi-stage attack. In such a scenario, it is plausible that the final stage would involve establishing a remote command shell. The T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique supports this assumption, as it often includes multiple stages, the final one being the establishment of a command and control channel. Therefore, it is likely that the attack's final payload will establish a remote command shell before connecting back to the command and control server.
