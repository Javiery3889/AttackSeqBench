 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the Naikon APT group used fileless loading techniques and operated C&C servers in limited time windows, which aligns with Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1086-PowerShell. This technique is often used for initial access and command execution, but it doesn't necessarily involve information gathering or communication with the C&C server.

2. The question also mentions the use of the Aria-body backdoor, which is a technique used for maintaining persistence and command execution on compromised systems. This aligns with Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1055-Remote Services.

3. The question asks if the APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase. This aligns with Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1086-Scripting.

4. After gathering information, the question mentions the use of HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. This aligns with the provided Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols.

5. Given the sequence of events described in the question (evasion, fileless loading, backdoor, information gathering, communication), it is likely that the APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase before utilizing HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
