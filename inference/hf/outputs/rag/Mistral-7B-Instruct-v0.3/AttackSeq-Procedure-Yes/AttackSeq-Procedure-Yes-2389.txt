 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware may use non-standard encoding (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding) for its communication. This suggests that the malware may not use the standard base64 alphabet but a custom one.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the malware will use encrypted and base64-encoded commands. The related TTPs suggest that the malware may use non-standard encoding, which aligns with the use of base64 encoding. However, the question also mentions encryption, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, since encrypted communication is a common practice for C2 communication, it is reasonable to assume that the malware may also use encryption. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will use encrypted and base64-encoded commands, possibly with a custom base64 alphabet.
