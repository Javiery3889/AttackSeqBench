 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance and communicating with control servers using RC4 and Base64 encoding, would use the same encryption methods for data exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Command and Control (T1132) was used with the Standard Encoding technique (T1132.001), which includes the use of RC4 and Base64 encoding. Additionally, the Tactic of Defense Evasion (T1140) was used with the Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique, but this technique does not directly relate to the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the implant has already used RC4 and Base64 encoding for communication, it is plausible that it would continue to use these encryption methods for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is A: Yes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration after initial reconnaissance and communication.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the implant has used RC4 and Base64 encoding for communication, suggesting a pattern of using these encryption methods.
   - Given this pattern, it is plausible that the implant would continue to use RC4 and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
