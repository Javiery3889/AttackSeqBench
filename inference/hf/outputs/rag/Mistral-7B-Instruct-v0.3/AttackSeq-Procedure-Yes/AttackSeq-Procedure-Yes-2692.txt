 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Elfin is likely to use web services such as POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for communication with compromised systems in the command and control phase before performing data exfiltration using FastUploader, given that DarkComet was used for credential dumping.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This suggests that the attacker is likely to exfiltrate data using a command and control channel, but it does not necessarily imply the use of specific tools like POSHC2 or Quasar RAT for communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after credential dumping with DarkComet. Since DarkComet is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows for command and control, it is likely that the attacker would use it for further actions, such as data exfiltration, rather than switching to another RAT like POSHC2 or Quasar RAT. The use of FastUploader for data exfiltration aligns with the TTP of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. However, the question does not provide information about the use of POSHC2 or Quasar RAT, so it is not likely that they would be used in this sequence.

Therefore, the answer is B: No, Elfin is not likely to use web services such as POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for communication with compromised systems in the command and control phase before performing data exfiltration using FastUploader.
