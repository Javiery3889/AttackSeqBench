 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware after establishing command and control communication using backdoor malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the tactic of Impact (T1486) and the technique of Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486.007). This suggests that the attacker is encrypting data as part of their impact strategy. However, it does not specify the use of Hermes ransomware or a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of Hermes ransomware and a 2048-bit RSA algorithm, but the related TTPs do not provide any evidence to support this. The question also mentions the use of backdoor malware, but the related TTPs do not mention this specifically.

4. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, it is not likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories. The question mentions specific details (Hermes ransomware and 2048-bit RSA algorithm) that are not supported by the related TTPs. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
