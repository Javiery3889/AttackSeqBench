 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers to upload encoded system information and switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address, given that NanHaiShu has already gathered system information from the infected machine and uploaded it to the C&C server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that NanHaiShu has performed Discovery (T1016) to gather system network configuration information. This suggests that the malware is actively exploring the network environment. The Command and Control tactic (T1071) is also mentioned, which includes the use of DNS for command and control communication. The specific technique T1071.004 refers to the use of Dynamic DNS providers for C&C communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTPs suggest that the malware is capable of using Dynamic DNS providers for communication, which aligns with the question's scenario of switching IP addresses. Since NanHaiShu has already uploaded system information to the C&C server, it is likely that it will continue to communicate with the C&C server, and using dynamic DNS providers to switch IP addresses is a plausible method for this communication.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware will communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers to upload encoded system information and switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address (Answer: A).
