 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it's likely that threat actors will perform system and user discovery after installing the AntSword webshell for initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Initial Access (T1190) and Discovery (T1033).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes aligns with the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs. After gaining initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 and installing the AntSword webshell, it is likely that the threat actors would perform system and user discovery (T1033) before evading defenses (which is not explicitly mentioned in the question but could be inferred as a subsequent step).
   - Answer Choice B: No does not align with the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, as it suggests that system and user discovery would not occur after the initial access, which contradicts the information provided.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is:

1. Initial Access (T1190) - Exploit Public-Facing Application (CVE-2019-0604) to install AntSword webshell
2. Discovery (T1033) - Run commands for system and user discovery
3. (Potential subsequent step) Defense Evasion (T1041) - Use a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader to evade defenses.
