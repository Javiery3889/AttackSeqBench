 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1078) is involved, specifically using Domain Accounts (T1078.002). This suggests that the attacker is trying to gain higher-level access to the network, which aligns with the question's focus on compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that best aligns with the question is as follows:
   - Initial Access: The Carbanak group would first need to gain access to the network, which could be through various means such as phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities. However, the question does not specify the Initial Access TTP, so we cannot definitively say which one was used.
   - Persistence: After gaining initial access, the attacker would establish persistence on the network to maintain access even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed. This could be achieved through various means such as setting up a backdoor or using a tool like Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - Privilege Escalation: The attacker would then escalate their privileges to gain higher-level access, such as Domain Administrator credentials, to move laterally within the network and compromise additional endpoints.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the Carbanak group first established persistence on the network using Cobalt Strike beacon (Persistence TTP).
   - After establishing persistence, they would map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials (Maintaining Persistence and Privilege Escalation TTPs).
   - Finally, they would use these credentials to compromise additional endpoints (Privilege Escalation TTP).
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs is plausible, and the final answer is "Yes".
