 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the T9000 malware, after evading detection and ensuring only one instance runs, will capture data and communicate with a C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using mutual exclusion (T1480.002) to ensure only one instance runs, and it is also using a non-application layer protocol (T1095) for communication. These TTPs suggest that the malware is designed to persist and communicate with a command and control server, which could be used to issue further commands, including data collection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the malware will capture data and communicate with a C2 server. The related TTPs suggest that the malware is designed to persist and communicate with a C2 server, which implies that it is likely to perform additional actions, such as data collection, before communicating with the C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Evade detection and ensure only one instance runs (T1480.002)
   - Capture data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft
   - Communicate with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol (implied by T1095)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the T9000 malware, after evading detection and ensuring only one instance runs, will capture data and communicate with a C2 server.
