 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Iranian state-backed hackers tailored their targeting approach after gaining initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Reconnaissance (T1591 and T1598) and Initial Access (T1566). Reconnaissance TTPs are used to gather information about the target, while Initial Access TTPs are used to gain access to the target's system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the hackers used phishing attacks to gain initial access. After gaining access, it is a common practice for threat actors to perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the victim. This information can include the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Iranian state-backed hackers tailored their targeting approach by gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.
