 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 (a known Advanced Persistent Threat group) will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the Tactic of Credential Access and the Technique T1003.001 - LSASS Memory. This technique is used to obtain credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process memory.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is one where the attacker first gathers information about the network and host configurations (reconnaissance) to better understand the environment and prepare for the next steps. This is a common practice in many attack sequences. After gathering this information, the attacker would then move on to the next step, which in this case is dumping the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
