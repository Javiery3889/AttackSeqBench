 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions after using AtomBombing for malicious code injection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion and Techniques T1211 (Exploitation for Defense Evasion) and T1055 (Process Injection). These TTPs suggest that the threat actors are employing methods to evade detection by security solutions, which aligns with the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: AtomBombing is a technique used for code injection, which allows threat actors to execute malicious code within the context of a legitimate process. This makes it difficult for security solutions to detect the malicious activity, as it appears as legitimate system behavior. Therefore, it is likely that threat actors will bypass antivirus, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is one where threat actors use AtomBombing for code injection, followed by defense evasion techniques to bypass security solutions. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
