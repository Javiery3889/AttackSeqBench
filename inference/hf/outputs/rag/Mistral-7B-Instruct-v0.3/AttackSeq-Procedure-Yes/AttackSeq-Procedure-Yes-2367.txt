 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware system has executed commands from an encrypted file to infect removable media and collect system files. This action aligns with the Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
2. The malware system then cleans up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts. This action aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal.
3. However, the question also mentions the possibility of the malware performing recursive directory listings and collecting system details before cleaning up. This action is not explicitly mentioned in the given answer choices, but it aligns with the Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-System Information Discovery.
4. Since the question asks if it is likely for the malware to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery (collect system files)
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-System Information Discovery (perform recursive directory listings and collect system details)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal (clean up indicators of its presence)
5. Therefore, the malware is likely to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence. This sequence is not explicitly mentioned in the answer choices, but it can be inferred from the given information and the related TTPs. So, the answer should be "Yes".
