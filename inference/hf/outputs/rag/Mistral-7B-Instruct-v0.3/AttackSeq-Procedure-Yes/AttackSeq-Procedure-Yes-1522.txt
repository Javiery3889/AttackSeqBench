 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about defense evasion techniques used after modifying a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code.
2. The related TTPs provided mention two defense evasion techniques: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
3. HTML Smuggling (T1027.006) involves hiding malicious content within seemingly harmless content, such as HTML comments or JavaScript code. However, the question mentions that the malicious code was appended to the existing Javascript file, which doesn't seem to fit the definition of HTML Smuggling.
4. Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) is a technique used to make files or information difficult to understand for humans and automated analysis tools. This can include encoding the malicious code, as mentioned in the question.
5. Dean Edwards Packer is a JavaScript obfuscator, a tool used to make JavaScript code harder to understand and analyze.
6. Given that the question mentions encoding the malicious code and the related TTPs include T1027, it is likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer.
