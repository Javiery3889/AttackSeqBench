 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if CosmicDuke, a known APT group, will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations after achieving persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke has persisted on a system using a scheduled task (T1053.005) and installed the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' However, there is no information in the related TTPs that suggests CosmicDuke specifically targets non-English filenames during its discovery operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are Yes and No. The question asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations. Based on the related TTPs, there is no evidence to suggest that CosmicDuke does this, so the most plausible answer is No.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations.
   - The related TTPs do not provide any evidence to suggest that CosmicDuke does this.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is No.
