 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the initial access being gained via phishing emails with executable attachments and the subsequent execution of SBDH malware. This aligns with Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
2. The SBDH malware is then said to download its backdoor and data stealer components, which is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, this action is a common behavior of malware after initial access.
3. The question then asks if the malware will employ a persistence technique to replace the handler for Word documents. This aligns with Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1070-Create or Modify System Process.
4. Lastly, the question mentions various communication methods to evade detection while interacting with its C&C server. This aligns with Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1086-PowerShell.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1070-Create or Modify System Process
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1086-PowerShell
6. Since all these TTPs are sequentially plausible and align with the question, the final answer is "Yes". The malware is likely to employ a persistence technique to replace the handler for Word documents before using various communication methods to evade detection while interacting with its C&C server.
