 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT41 is likely to deploy MBR bootkits before leveraging malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of a bootkit (T1542.003) for defense evasion and pre-operating system execution, and also for maintaining persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of a bootkit for both defense evasion and persistence aligns with the strategy of deploying MBR bootkits before leveraging other malware. This sequence would allow APT41 to maintain a low profile (defense evasion) and ensure continued access to compromised systems (persistence).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if APT41 is likely to deploy MBR bootkits before using credential stealers and keyloggers.
   - The related TTPs mention the use of a bootkit (T1542.003) for both defense evasion and persistence, which aligns with the strategy of deploying MBR bootkits before leveraging other malware.
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT41 would deploy MBR bootkits before using credential stealers and keyloggers.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
