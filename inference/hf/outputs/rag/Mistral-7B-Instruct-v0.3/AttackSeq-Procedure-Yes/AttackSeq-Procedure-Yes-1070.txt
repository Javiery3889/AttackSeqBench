 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will collect system information and capture screenshots from infected machines under the SLUB variant before exfiltrating this information to the Mattermost server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using techniques for Collection, specifically T1005-Data from Local System and T1113-Screen Capture.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the deployment of malware to evade detection. The TTPs related to the question suggest that the attackers will collect system information (T1005) and capture screenshots (T1113) before exfiltrating the data. This sequence aligns with the question, as the attackers would first gather the necessary information and then send it to the Mattermost server.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System (collect system information)
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture (capture screenshots)
- Tactic: Exfiltration (exfiltrate the collected information to the Mattermost server)

Since the question does not explicitly mention the exfiltration step, we can only confirm that the attackers will collect system information and capture screenshots before exfiltrating the data. However, based on the typical attack sequence, it is likely that the attackers will exfiltrate the data after collecting it.
