 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an adversary, after using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery, will copy results of the discovery phase and exfiltrate the data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and Collection, as well as specific techniques for Exfiltration (T1567.002 and T1041) and Automated Collection (T1119). This suggests that the adversary is likely to exfiltrate data, including the results of the discovery phase, and may use cloud storage or other channels for this purpose.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase and then exfiltrate the data. The related TTPs support this sequence, as they indicate that the adversary is likely to use exfiltration techniques, including cloud storage, after the collection phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the adversary will copy results of the discovery phase and exfiltrate the data.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the adversary is likely to use exfiltration techniques, including cloud storage, after the collection phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Collection (T1119), Exfiltration (T1567.002 or T1041), and Exfiltration to Cloud Storage (T1567.002).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
