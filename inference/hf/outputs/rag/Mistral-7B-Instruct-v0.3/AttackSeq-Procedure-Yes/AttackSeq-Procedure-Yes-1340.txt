 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control, given that the initial Flash zero-day exploit has gained arbitrary read/write memory capabilities to execute a second stage shellcode.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves exploitation (T1203) and a multi-stage attack (T1104). In a multi-stage attack, the attacker typically uses multiple stages of malware to evade detection and gain more control over the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of events where an initial exploit is used to gain arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, followed by the execution of a second stage shellcode. This sequence aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution TTP, which is the initial stage of a multi-stage attack (T1104). In a multi-stage attack, it is common for the second stage to download additional malware (the final payload in this case) and establish communication with command and control servers. Therefore, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download FinSpy and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an initial exploit is used to gain arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, followed by the execution of a second stage shellcode.
   - This sequence aligns with the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution TTP, which is the initial stage of a multi-stage attack (T1104).
   - In a multi-stage attack, it is common for the second stage to download additional malware (the final payload in this case) and establish communication with command and control servers.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download FinSpy and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
