 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers. The question specifically mentions the use of an Explosive Trojan for lateral movement, which is a technique under the Tactic: Lateral Movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Lateral Movement and Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media. This technique is used for spreading malware to other systems by using removable media, such as USB drives.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not mention the use of removable media for spreading malware within the network. Instead, it mentions the use of an Explosive Trojan for lateral movement. The use of an Explosive Trojan does not typically involve the manual spreading of malware to other systems via USB drives.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the attackers will not use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan. Instead, they will likely use the Explosive Trojan for lateral movement, which does not involve the use of removable media.
