 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send benign daily emails after using fake social media personas and stealing sensitive data from social media mobile apps.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that WINDSHIFT APT is involved in Resource Development (T1585) and Initial Access (T1566) through spearphishing. This suggests that they are building a presence and gaining access to their targets.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that WINDSHIFT APT has already gathered identifiable information and stolen sensitive data, which aligns with the T1585.001 (Social Media Accounts) and T1566.003 (Spearphishing via Service) TTPs. Sending benign emails to build a relationship and track interactions via specific domains (T1585.002 - Email Accounts) is a common tactic after initial access and resource development, as it allows them to maintain a presence and gather more information about the target.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs and the question, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send benign daily emails to the target after using fake social media personas and stealing sensitive data from social media mobile apps.
