 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Moafee and DragonOK are likely to use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development and then employ environment-based evasion techniques after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing (T1566-Phishing), and the attackers are expected to focus on resource development (Tactic: Resource Development) and malware (Technique: T1587.001-Malware).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. The sequence that aligns best with the question and the related TTPs is:
   - Initial Access (T1566-Phishing)
   - Resource Development (Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware)
   - Post-Exploitation (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1021-Remote Access Tools)
   - Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-CPU-Pivot or T1570-Process Injection)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access: The attackers gained initial access through spear-phishing emails (T1566-Phishing).
   - Resource Development: After gaining access, the attackers would develop and deploy custom-built backdoors and RATs to support their operations (Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware).
   - Post-Exploitation: With the backdoors and RATs in place, the attackers can maintain persistence and control over the compromised system (Tactic: Command and Control).
   - Defense Evasion: To evade detection, the attackers may use environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks or process injection, to execute their payloads (Tactic: Defense Evasion).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Initial Access: T1566-Phishing
   - Resource Development: Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware
   - Post-Exploitation: Tactic: Command and Control (T1021-Remote Access Tools)
   - Defense Evasion: Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1036-CPU-Pivot or T1570-Process Injection)
