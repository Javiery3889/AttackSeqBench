 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Turla is known for establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks for Persistence. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before its operators download specialized tools for Collection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion and the Technique of T1014-Rootkit. This suggests that the attacker is trying to conceal their presence in the network, which aligns with the use of a rootkit.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Persistence (Turla establishes a hidden foothold)
   - Defense Evasion (use of a rootkit to conceal the spying operation)
   - Collection (downloading specialized tools for gathering sensitive information)

Given this sequence, it is likely that the malware will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before the Collection phase.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
