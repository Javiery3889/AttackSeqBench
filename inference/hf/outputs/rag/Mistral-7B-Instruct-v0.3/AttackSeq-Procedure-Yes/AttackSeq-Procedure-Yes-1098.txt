 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will collect information about network users and settings using tools like adfind before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts, given that they have already used malicious macros to achieve initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through domain accounts (T1078.002) or valid accounts (T1078), which aligns with the question's scenario. Additionally, the Tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1484) is also mentioned, suggesting that the attacker may move to escalate privileges after initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Initial Access has been achieved, and the Tactic of Privilege Escalation is likely to follow. The Tactic of Collection (T1086, T1005, etc.) is not explicitly mentioned, but the question asks about collecting information about network users and settings, which is a common step in the attack chain. However, the tool adfind is mentioned, which is a common tool used for collecting information about Active Directory objects, such as users and their settings. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker will collect information about network users and settings using tools like adfind before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Lazarus Group will collect information about network users and settings using tools like adfind before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved, and privilege escalation is likely to follow.
   - The question does not explicitly mention the collection of information, but the tool adfind is mentioned, which is a common tool used for collecting information about Active Directory objects.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker will collect information about network users and settings using tools like adfind before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
