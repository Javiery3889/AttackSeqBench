 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors, after subverting trust controls to evade defenses (T1553), would perform process discovery (T1057) and then leverage compromised infrastructure for command and control using application layer protocol (T1071).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Command and Control (Tactic) and Defense Evasion (Tactic). The specific techniques mentioned are T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) and T1071.004 (DNS) for Command and Control, and T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls) for Defense Evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls: Threat actors subvert trust controls to evade defenses.
   - T1057 - Process Discovery: To gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks, threat actors may perform process discovery.
   - T1071 - Application Layer Protocol: Threat actors leverage compromised infrastructure for command and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Threat actors subvert trust controls (T1553) to evade defenses and gain initial access to the network.
   - To understand the systems and internal networks better, they may perform process discovery (T1057).
   - Once they have gathered enough information, they can leverage compromised infrastructure for command and control using application layer protocol (T1071).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1553 -> T1057 -> T1071. The final answer is: Yes.
