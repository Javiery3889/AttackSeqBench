 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Credential Access (T1555) and Reconnaissance (T1589.001), with a specific focus on collecting credentials from password stores (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores) and credentials in files (T1552.001-Credentials In Files).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after persistence, and the related TTPs suggest that the next logical step would be to gather credentials for further access and privilege escalation. The TTPs T1555-Credentials from Password Stores and T1552.001-Credentials In Files are related to credential access, which aligns with the question's context.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
