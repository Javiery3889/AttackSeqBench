 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Asruex malware is likely to detect anti-virus software to evade detection before retrieving an image file with encoded malware from the C&C server for decoding and execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) to download and execute a batch file, and the use of binary padding (T1027.001) and deobfuscation (T1140) to evade detection. However, there is no mention of Asruex malware or any specific technique related to detecting anti-virus software.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Asruex malware's behavior regarding anti-virus detection, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about this specific malware or its behavior related to anti-virus detection. The TTPs only indicate techniques used for evasion, not detection. Therefore, it is not likely that Asruex malware will detect anti-virus software before retrieving an image file with encoded malware from the C&C server for decoding and execution.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include Asruex malware detecting anti-virus software before retrieving an image file with encoded malware from the C&C server for decoding and execution. The final answer is "No".
