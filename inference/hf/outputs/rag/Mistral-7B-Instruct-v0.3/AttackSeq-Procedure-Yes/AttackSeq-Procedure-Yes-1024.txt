 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase after injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already performed lateral movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content) by injecting malicious macros into documents, and the collection of data from local systems (T1005-Data from Local System) is a common tactic in a cyber attack.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the collection phase, and the related TTPs suggest that the attacker has already moved laterally and has the capability to collect data from local systems. Injecting malicious macros into documents is often a method used to gain initial access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment), but it is not directly related to the collection phase. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase (T1005-Data from Local System).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.
