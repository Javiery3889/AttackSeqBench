 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Elise malware has collected system information, and the question asks if it is likely to communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique involves using web protocols for Command and Control, which aligns with the question's requirement of using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes Elise malware's discovery phase, where it collects system information. After the discovery phase, it is common for malware to communicate with a C2 server for further instructions. The related TTPs suggest that Elise malware might use web protocols for Command and Control, which aligns with the question's scenario. Therefore, it is likely that Elise malware will communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as follows:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (Elise malware collects system information)
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (Elise malware communicates with the C2 server using web protocols for Command and Control)
