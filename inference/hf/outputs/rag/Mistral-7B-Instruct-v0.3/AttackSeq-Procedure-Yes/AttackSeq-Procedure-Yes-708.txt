 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of Aumlib malware downloading updated samples and sharing code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, which suggests that the malware may use web protocols for communication with its command and control server.
3. The Tactic: Defense Evasion and Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools, while not directly related to the question, indicates that the malware has the capability to evade detection, which aligns with the question's mention of altering HTTP communication patterns.
4. Given that Aumlib malware has the capability to evade detection and uses web protocols (as suggested by the related TTPs), it is plausible that it would download updated samples and share code with an older variant as part of its command and control activity. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
