 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if BlueBravo is likely to use GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton malware loaders to gather victim system information after delivering them through spearphishing emails with malicious links.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link indicates that the attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious link to gain initial access to the victim's system. However, this TTP does not provide information about the subsequent actions of the attacker.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. The most plausible sequence would be:
   - Tactic: Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link)
   - Tactic: Discovery (T1087-System Information Discovery)

   The attacker first gains initial access to the system through a spearphishing link, and then they would likely use the malware loaders (GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton) to gather system information, such as username, computer name, and network connections, which falls under the Tactic: Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if BlueBravo is likely to use GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton malware loaders to gather victim system information after delivering them through spearphishing emails with malicious links.
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be:
     - Tactic: Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link)
     - Tactic: Discovery (T1087-System Information Discovery)
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
