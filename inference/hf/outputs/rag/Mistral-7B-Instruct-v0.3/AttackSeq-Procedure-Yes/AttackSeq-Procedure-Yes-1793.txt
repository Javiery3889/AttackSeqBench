 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the OceanLotus Group expanding their control within a network after harvesting credentials and performing credential dumping.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the group is known to use Credential Access (T1555) and Lateral Movement (T1550.002) techniques.
3. The Credential Access technique (T1555) is used to harvest credentials, which aligns with the initial action mentioned in the question.
4. The Lateral Movement technique (T1550.002) is used to move within a network using stolen credentials, which is a logical next step after gaining access to credentials.
5. The question also mentions the use of pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash techniques, which are methods of lateral movement that can be used to impersonate other users and authenticate without the need for the original credentials. These techniques are included in the Lateral Movement tactic (T1512) and are related to the T1550.002 technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
6. The question then asks if data exfiltration through a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook is likely to follow. While there is no specific TTP related to this action in the question or related TTPs, it is a common tactic used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like OceanLotus for data exfiltration (T1041 - Data Staged).
7. Therefore, based on the sequence of TTPs provided in the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the OceanLotus Group will expand their control within the network by using stolen credentials, pass-the-ticket, and pass-the-hash techniques before executing data exfiltration through a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.
