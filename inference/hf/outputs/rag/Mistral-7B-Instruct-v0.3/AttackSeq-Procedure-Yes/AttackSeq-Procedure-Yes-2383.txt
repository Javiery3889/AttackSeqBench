 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing (T1566), and the malware is also associated with process hollowing (T1055.012) for defense evasion. There is no mention of privilege escalation in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after initial access. The most plausible sequence would be Initial Access (T1566) -> Defense Evasion (T1055.012) -> Discovery (T1086, T1057, etc.). Process hollowing (T1055.012) is a technique used for defense evasion, which aligns with the question's requirement of evading detection before discovery activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access (T1566) was achieved through spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
   - To evade detection, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would use process hollowing (T1055.012), as indicated by the related TTPs.
   - After evading detection, the malware could then engage in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.
