 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Shuckworm, after executing malicious VBS scripts and deploying their custom backdoor, is likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Shuckworm is known to use T1218.005 (Defense Evasion) with Mshta, and T1059.005 (Execution) with Visual Basic.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial execution of malicious VBS scripts and deployment of the custom backdoor. The related TTPs suggest that Shuckworm uses mshta.exe (T1218.005) for defense evasion, which aligns with the question's requirement of bypassing application control solutions. Following this, they use their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but is a common tactic for Shuckworm), which aligns with the question's requirement of employing their HTTP-based C&C servers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial execution of malicious VBS scripts and deployment of the custom backdoor.
   - The related TTPs suggest that Shuckworm uses mshta.exe (T1218.005) for defense evasion, which aligns with the question's requirement of bypassing application control solutions.
   - After bypassing application control solutions, it is likely that Shuckworm would use their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading, which is a common tactic for this threat actor but not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - Execution of malicious VBS scripts (T1059.001)
     - Deployment of custom backdoor (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs but implied)
     - Defense Evasion using mshta.exe (T1218.005)
     - Employment of HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading (implied but not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs)
   - Final Answer: Yes.
