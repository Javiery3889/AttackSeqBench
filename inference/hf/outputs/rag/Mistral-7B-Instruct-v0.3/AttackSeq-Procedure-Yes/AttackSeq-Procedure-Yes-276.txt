 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and Defense Evasion techniques (T1140). However, the TTPs do not suggest that the PowerShell script will decode and execute a script from an image file before downloading other components.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question presents two answer choices, A: Yes and B: No. Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the PowerShell script will first perform its intended actions (initial access, possibly obfuscation or decryption) and then download other components, rather than decoding and executing a script from an image file before these actions.

Therefore, the answer is B: No. The PowerShell script is unlikely to decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
