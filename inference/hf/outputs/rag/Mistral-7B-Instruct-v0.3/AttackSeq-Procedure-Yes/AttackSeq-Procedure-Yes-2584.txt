 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers after discovering system information.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocols. T1071.001 refers to the use of web protocols for command and control, while T1095 refers to the use of non-application layer protocols.
3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the question mentions application layer protocols, T1071.001 (Web Protocols) seems more relevant as it specifically refers to application layer protocols. However, the question does not explicitly rule out non-application layer protocols, so T1095 is not completely irrelevant. But since the question asks about application layer protocols, T1071.001 is a more plausible answer.
4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers using application layer protocols (T1071.001). Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
