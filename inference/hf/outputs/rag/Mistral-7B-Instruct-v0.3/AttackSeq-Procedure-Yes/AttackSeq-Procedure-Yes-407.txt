 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a malicious Excel file contained a macro designed to display a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent after phishing emails were sent by actors associated with the OilRig campaign.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the Execution tactic with the Technique T1204.002 (Malicious File), and the Initial Access tactic with the Technique T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs that could lead to the installation of ISMAgent. The sequence that aligns best with the question is:
   - T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment): OilRig actors send phishing emails with a malicious Excel file attached.
   - T1204.002 (Malicious File): The malicious Excel file contains a macro that displays a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background.
   - (Implied) T1055.001 (PowerShell): The malicious code in the Excel macro could use PowerShell to install ISMAgent.
