 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if UNC2452, a threat actor, employed Discovery techniques before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that UNC2452 used the Application Layer Protocol (T1071) for Command and Control, and also that they may have used Discovery techniques, specifically Process Discovery (T1057).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs suggest that Discovery (T1057) could have been used before Command and Control (T1071). Therefore, it is plausible that UNC2452 employed Discovery techniques before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if UNC2452 employed Discovery techniques before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.
   - The related TTPs suggest that Discovery (T1057) could have been used before Command and Control (T1071).
   - Therefore, it is plausible that UNC2452 employed Discovery techniques such as querying the registry and identifying running processes to gain knowledge about systems and the internal network before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
