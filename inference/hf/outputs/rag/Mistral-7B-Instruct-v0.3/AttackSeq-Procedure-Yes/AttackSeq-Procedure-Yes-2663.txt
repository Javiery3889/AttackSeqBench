 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers established backdoor access on the infected SK Communications computers using 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza'. This action is typically followed by the establishment of Command and Control (C2) communication between the infected machines and the attacker's C2 server.

2. The related TTPs provided, T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver and T1071.004-DNS, both fall under the Tactic: Command and Control. This suggests that the attackers may use these techniques to establish and maintain C2 communication.

3. T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is a technique where the attacker uses a dead drop resolver to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This could potentially be used to mask the true IP address of the C2 server. However, the question asks if the infected computers communicated with the domain 'update.alyac.org' which resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

4. T1071.004-DNS is a technique where the attacker registers or modifies DNS records to redirect traffic or establish C2 communication. This technique could potentially be used to make the infected computers communicate with the IP address 116.127.121.41, but it does not necessarily mean that the domain 'update.alyac.org' was used for this purpose.

5. Given that the question specifically asks about the communication with the domain 'update.alyac.org', the most plausible answer would be that the infected computers communicated with the command and control server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41. This implies that the attackers may have used T1071.004-DNS to resolve 'update.alyac.org' to the C2 server's IP address, which is 116.127.121.41. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
