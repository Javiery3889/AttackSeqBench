 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events after gaining initial access to hosts using remote access tools and creating new local accounts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has performed Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool) by using remote access software (T1219-Remote Access Software) and created local accounts. Additionally, the Defense Evasion tactic (T1078.003-Local Accounts) is mentioned, which suggests that the attacker is trying to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the attacker will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events. The Defense Evasion tactic (T1078.003-Local Accounts) suggests that the attacker is trying to evade detection, and one way to do this is by using tools like AutoExe1.bat to clear system events and download malware. The related TTPs do not provide evidence that the attacker will not use AutoExe1.bat for these purposes, so the most plausible answer is "Yes".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events after gaining initial access to hosts.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has performed Resource Development and created local accounts, suggesting they are trying to establish a foothold in the network.
   - The Defense Evasion tactic (T1078.003-Local Accounts) suggests that the attacker is trying to evade detection, and one way to do this is by using tools like AutoExe1.bat to clear system events and download malware.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events as part of their efforts to evade detection.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
