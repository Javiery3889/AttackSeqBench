 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will add the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence before the PowerShell script collects system information and communicates with a C&C server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactic of interest is Persistence, and the technique used is T1053.005 - Scheduled Task. This technique involves creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious script or program at a later time to maintain access to the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where social engineering is used to trick victims into enabling macros and payload execution. This sequence is followed by the PowerShell script collecting system information and communicating with a C&C server. Adding the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence can be seen as a logical step before the PowerShell script runs, as it ensures the attackers maintain access to the system even after the initial PowerShell script has completed its tasks.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is likely that the attackers will add the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler for persistence before the PowerShell script collects system information and communicates with a C&C server. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
