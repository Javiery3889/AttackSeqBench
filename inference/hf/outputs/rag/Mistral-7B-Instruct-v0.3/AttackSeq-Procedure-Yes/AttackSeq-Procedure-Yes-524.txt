 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the INOCNATION malware, after employing several defense evasion techniques, is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control communications.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) and is employing Web Protocols (T1071.001) and Asymmetric Cryptography (T1573.002).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of Asymmetric Cryptography (T1573.002) suggests that the malware is using encryption for its communications. The use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) implies that the malware may use HTTPS, which is an encrypted protocol, for its command and control communications. Since the malware has already employed defense evasion techniques, it is likely to use SSL/TLS connections to further hide its communications. The Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries are commonly used for secure communication over the internet, and it is plausible that the malware would use these libraries to blend in with normal network traffic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The INOCNATION malware, after employing defense evasion techniques, is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control communications. This is based on the use of Asymmetric Cryptography (T1573.002) and Web Protocols (T1071.001) in the related TTPs, which suggest the use of encryption and the possibility of using HTTPS for command and control communications. Additionally, the use of defense evasion techniques indicates a desire to hide the malware's activities, which is consistent with the use of SSL/TLS connections to blend in with normal network traffic. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
