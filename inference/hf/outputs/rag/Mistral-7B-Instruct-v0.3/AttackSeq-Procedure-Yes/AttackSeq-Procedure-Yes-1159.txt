 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is collecting data by archiving it (T1560) and using a custom method for archiving (T1560.003). There is no mention of encoding or splitting the archives in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about TTPs related to the Exfiltration phase, but the related TTPs only involve the Collection phase. There is no evidence in the question or the related TTPs to suggest that the malware will encode the archives or split them into chunks before exfiltrating them.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the malware will encode the archives and split them into chunks during the Exfiltration phase. However, the related TTPs only involve the Collection phase and do not mention encoding or splitting the archives. Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will encode the archives and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase. Final Answer: B: No.
