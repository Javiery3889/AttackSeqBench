 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs involve Exfiltration techniques, specifically Automated Exfiltration (T1020) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041).
3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of Tor hidden services and SSH connections in the exfiltration process. While the question does not explicitly mention Tor hidden services, the technique T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) can be performed over various communication channels, including Tor. SSH connections are also a common method for establishing a C2 channel (T1078). The technique T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) aligns with the question's requirement for regular intervals.
4. Infamous Chisel is a post-exploitation tool used for maintaining access to compromised systems and exfiltrating data. It is known to use SSH for C2 communication and can be configured to exfiltrate data at regular intervals. Therefore, it is plausible that Infamous Chisel would automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.
