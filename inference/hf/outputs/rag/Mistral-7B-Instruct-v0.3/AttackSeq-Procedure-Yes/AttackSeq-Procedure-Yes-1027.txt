 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control, after using their backdoors to automatically list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques for Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols), Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), but there is no mention of taking screenshots or using malware for this purpose.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The sequence in the question (Taking screenshots -> Command and Control) is not found in the related TTPs. On the other hand, the related TTPs show a sequence of (Exfiltration -> Command and Control), which is not the same as the sequence in the question. Therefore, it is not likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests a sequence of TTPs that is not supported by the related TTPs.
   - The related TTPs show a sequence of (Exfiltration -> Command and Control), but not (Taking screenshots -> Command and Control).
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
   - Final Answer: No.
