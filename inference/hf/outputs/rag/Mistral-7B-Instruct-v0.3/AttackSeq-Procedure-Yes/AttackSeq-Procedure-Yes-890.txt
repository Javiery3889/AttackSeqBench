 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will leverage legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, bypassing their traditional toolset for evading defenses, after executing malware through spear-phishing exploit documents.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Lateral Movement (Tactic), Internal Spearphishing (Technique), Defense Evasion (Tactic), and Exploitation for Defense Evasion (Technique), as well as Valid Accounts (Technique) which is not directly related to the question but could be used for bypassing defenses.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about lateral movement and defense evasion after a spear-phishing attack. The related TTPs include Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion, which suggests that APT28 might use these techniques to move laterally within the network and evade defenses. The answer choice A: Yes aligns best with the attack sequence in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after a spear-phishing attack with GAMEFISH malware.
   - The related TTPs include Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion, which suggests that APT28 might use these techniques to move laterally within the network and evade defenses.
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT28 will leverage legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, bypassing their traditional toolset for evading defenses.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
