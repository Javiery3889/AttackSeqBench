 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT15 is likely to use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution, given that they have already used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT15 has used T1078.002 (Domain Accounts) to gain initial access and T1552.004 (Private Keys) to access private keys, which could include VPN certificates.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - T1078.002 (Domain Accounts) - Initial Access: APT15 gains domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - T1552.004 (Private Keys) - Credential Access: APT15 uses the stolen credentials to access private keys, which could include VPN certificates.
   - T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol) or T1021.002 (Remote Services) - Initial Access: APT15 could use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network.
   - T1055 (Remote Access Tools) - Initial Access: APT15 deploys backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - APT15 has gained domain administrator credentials (T1078.002), which they can use to access private keys (T1552.004).
   - With the stolen VPN certificate, APT15 can remotely access the network (T1021.001 or T1021.002).
   - Once they have access, they can deploy backdoors (T1055) such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution.

Therefore, it is likely that APT15 will use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution. Final Answer: Yes.
