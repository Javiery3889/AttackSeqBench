 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Grandoreiro (a hypothetical malware) will discover system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C&C server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Grandoreiro uses T1547.009 (Shortcut Modification) and T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) for persistence. These techniques do not inherently involve discovering system information before communicating with the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs do not suggest that system information discovery is a step that occurs before persistence and communication with the C&C server. Therefore, it is more likely that system information discovery is not a part of the sequence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Grandoreiro will discover system information before communicating with the C&C server.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that system information discovery is a step that occurs before persistence and communication with the C&C server.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that Grandoreiro will create a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory for persistence (T1547.009) and then communicate with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands, without discovering system information first.
   - Final Answer: No.
