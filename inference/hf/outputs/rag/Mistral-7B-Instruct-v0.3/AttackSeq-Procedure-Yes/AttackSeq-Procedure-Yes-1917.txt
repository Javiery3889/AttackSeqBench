 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT10 is using Discovery techniques (T1018-Remote System Discovery, T1046-Network Service Discovery) to map out the network and identify systems of interest. Additionally, they are using the Collection technique T1074.002-Remote Data Staging, which involves staging data remotely, often using compression tools and multi-part archives.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTPs suggest that APT10 is likely to identify systems of interest (Discovery) and then stage data remotely (Collection). The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with this sequence, as it suggests that after identifying systems of interest, APT10 would likely use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs is:
- T1018-Remote System Discovery (Discovery)
- T1046-Network Service Discovery (Discovery)
- T1074.002-Remote Data Staging (Collection)
- Remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools (Technique within Collection)
- Staging data in multi-part archives (Technique within Collection)
