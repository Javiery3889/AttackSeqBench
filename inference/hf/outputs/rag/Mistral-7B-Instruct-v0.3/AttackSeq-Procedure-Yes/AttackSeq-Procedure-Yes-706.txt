 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT12, after deploying updated versions of their malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe), will attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic as part of defense evasion before connecting to specific URLs during command and control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding, which suggests that encoding of data during communication is a possibility. Additionally, the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File is also mentioned, which indicates that the malware may use encrypted or encoded files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about encoding the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic. Both TTPs mentioned in the related TTPs (T1132.001 and T1027.013) are related to encoding and encryption, making it plausible that APT12 would employ these techniques as part of their updated malware.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that APT12 will attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic as part of defense evasion before connecting to specific URLs during command and control. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
