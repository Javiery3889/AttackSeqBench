 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for Command and Control (C&C) communication after the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Command and Control is involved, specifically using Web Protocols (T1071.001). This suggests that the attackers may use HTTP or other web-based protocols for C&C communication. Additionally, the Tactic of Discovery (T1082) is mentioned, which could imply that the attackers are gathering system information, but this is not directly related to the C&C communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the Aria-body backdoor collects information. The related TTPs suggest that the attackers may use HTTP or TCP protocols for C&C communication, which aligns with the sequence of events described in answer choice A. Answer choice B, stating that they will not use HTTP and TCP protocols, contradicts the related TTPs.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and the related TTPs is:
- Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine (Discovery, T1082)
- Naikon APT group uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication (Command and Control, T1071.001)
- Execution of additional commands received from the server (Command and Control, T1071.002)
