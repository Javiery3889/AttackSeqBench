 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories, given that the StellarParticle campaign used Discovery techniques to identify Active Directory information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the campaign used Discovery techniques (T1482-Domain Trust Discovery) and Lateral Movement techniques (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol). This suggests that the threat actor discovered information about the network, including domain trusts, and then moved laterally using RDP.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP. The use of RDP for Lateral Movement (T1021.001) implies that the threat actor is moving between systems, which could be done using either privileged or non-privileged accounts. However, the use of RDP typically requires some level of access, which could be considered a privileged account. Therefore, it is plausible that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories. Given the Discovery and Lateral Movement TTPs used in the StellarParticle campaign, it is plausible that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP. Therefore, the final answer is Yes.
