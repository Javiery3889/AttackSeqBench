 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: LYCEUM has gained initial access and delivered DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments. The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before utilizing it for execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using spearphishing attachments (T1192) to deliver malware (T1055). This suggests that the attacker is using multiple stages in their attack, which is consistent with the use of an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop (T1055.002) to drop the malware before execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that LYCEUM would use such a tool to drop the DanBot malware before executing it. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

In summary, based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before utilizing it for execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.
