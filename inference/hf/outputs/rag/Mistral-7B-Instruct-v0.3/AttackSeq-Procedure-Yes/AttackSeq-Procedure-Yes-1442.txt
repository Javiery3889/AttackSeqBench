 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor malware, after initial access via exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) and dropping itself, will evolve to avoid network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves exploitation (T1203) and initial access via spearphishing attachment (T1566.001). This suggests that the attacker has already gained initial access and is now looking to maintain persistence and communicate with the CnC server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A: Yes - Given that the attacker has already gained initial access and is aware of the network environment, it is likely that they would attempt to evolve the malware to avoid detection before communicating with the CnC server. This would help ensure the success of the attack and avoid being detected by security measures.
   - Answer B: No - It is not likely that the attacker would not attempt to evolve the malware to avoid detection, as this would increase the chances of being detected and the attack being thwarted.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access (T1566.001) - Spearphishing Attachment
   - Execution (T1203) - Exploitation for Client Execution
   - Persistence (T1071) - Techniques used to maintain persistence on the compromised system
   - Command and Control (T1086) - Techniques used to communicate with the CnC server
   - Defense Evasion (T1036) - Techniques used to avoid detection while communicating with the CnC server (as per the question)

Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
