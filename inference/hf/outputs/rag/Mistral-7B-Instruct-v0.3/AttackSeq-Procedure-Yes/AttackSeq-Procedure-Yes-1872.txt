 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: FIN13 is a threat actor that has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for Initial Access. The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, which is a common technique used during the Reconnaissance phase to gather network information. The TTP T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is related to the Execution phase, but it does not necessarily imply that FIN13 will use it for network traffic proxying.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since FIN13 has already gained Initial Access and deployed web shells, it is likely that they would want to gather more information about the victim network to plan their next steps. This aligns with the Reconnaissance phase. After gathering the necessary information, they might employ JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 will gather victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
