 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a backdoor function will collect machine information and take screenshots during the discovery phase after obfuscation through scriptlet and inf files for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Discovery (T1082) and potentially collecting system information. However, there is no mention of the Collection tactic (T1113) for screen capture during the discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the discovery phase, and the related TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering system information during this phase. However, the Collection tactic (T1113) for screen capture is not mentioned in the related TTPs as part of the discovery phase. Therefore, it is less likely that the backdoor function will collect machine information and take screenshots during the discovery phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the discovery phase, and the related TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering system information during this phase.
   - The Collection tactic (T1113) for screen capture is not mentioned in the related TTPs as part of the discovery phase.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the backdoor function will collect machine information and take screenshots during the discovery phase.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
