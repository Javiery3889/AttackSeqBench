 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FIN8, after using wmic.exe for lateral movement, is likely to conduct system fingerprinting and network configuration discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN8 is known to perform System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016) and the question specifically mentions the use of tools like ipconfig.exe and ping.exe for this purpose.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of wmic.exe for lateral movement, which is a technique under the Execution tactic (T1047). However, the TTPs related to this question are related to the Discovery tactic (T1016). System fingerprinting (gathering system information) is often the first step in the Discovery tactic. Therefore, it is likely that FIN8 would conduct system fingerprinting before determining the system network configuration.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that FIN8 would conduct system fingerprinting via commands like systeminfo.exe and net.exe before determining the system network configuration using tools such as ipconfig.exe and ping.exe. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
