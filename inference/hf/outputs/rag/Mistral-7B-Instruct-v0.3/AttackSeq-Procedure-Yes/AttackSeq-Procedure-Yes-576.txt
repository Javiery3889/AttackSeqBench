 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors moved laterally to other systems using credentials dumped with Mimikatz and executed commands with Impacket's atexec tool before utilizing the AntSword webshell and AntSword Shell Manager.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell), Lateral Movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash), and Credential Access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs before using the AntSword webshell and AntSword Shell Manager. The related TTPs suggest that the attack sequence might involve credential access (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) to steal credentials, lateral movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) to move to other systems using those stolen credentials, and then persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell) to establish a web shell for command and control. Impacket's atexec tool is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it can be used for executing commands on remote systems, which aligns with the lateral movement and command and control phases. Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping, which aligns with the credential access phase. Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials and then moved laterally using Impacket's atexec tool before establishing the AntSword webshell.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs before using the AntSword webshell and AntSword Shell Manager.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attack sequence might involve credential access, lateral movement, and persistence.
   - Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping, and Impacket's atexec tool can be used for executing commands on remote systems, which aligns with the lateral movement and command and control phases.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials, moved laterally using Impacket's atexec tool, and then established the AntSword webshell for command and control.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
