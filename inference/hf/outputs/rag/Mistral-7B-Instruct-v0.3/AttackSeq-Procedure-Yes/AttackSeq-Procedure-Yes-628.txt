 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation after executing itself in the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion (T1027) and the Technique of Obfuscated Files or Information. This indicates that the malware is likely to use techniques to evade detection and minimize visibility.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the malware being hidden in the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension, which is a form of obfuscation. This action aligns with the Tactic of Defense Evasion and Technique of Obfuscated Files or Information mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
