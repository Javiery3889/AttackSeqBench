 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the attackers using Cobalt Strike beacon to perform specific actions after establishing persistence and escalating privileges.
2. The attackers have already established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control server (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts).
3. They have also escalated privileges by compromising a Domain Administrator account (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts).
4. Cobalt Strike is a popular tool used for post-exploitation activities, including discovering the internal network, collecting administrative level credentials, and compromising additional network endpoints (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-Remote System Discovery; Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping; Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021-Remote Services).
5. Given that the attackers have already escalated their privileges, it is likely that they would use their newfound administrative access to further their attack, which includes using Cobalt Strike beacon for the mentioned activities.
6. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
