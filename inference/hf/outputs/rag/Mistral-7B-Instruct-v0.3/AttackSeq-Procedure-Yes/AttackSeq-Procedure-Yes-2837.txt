 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations, given that it has discovered system information and process lists.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using T1057 (Process Discovery) to gather system information, but there is no mention of T1071.001 (Web Protocols) or HTTPS specifically.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any evidence that the malware is using HTTPS for command and control operations. In fact, the TTPs provided suggest that the malware is using command-line tools (cmd.exe) to gather system information, not web protocols. Therefore, it is more likely that the malware will not use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the malware will use HTTPS communication for command and control operations.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using T1057 (Process Discovery) to gather system information, but there is no mention of T1071.001 (Web Protocols) or HTTPS specifically.
   - Given that there is no evidence of the malware using web protocols or HTTPS, it is more likely that the malware will not use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
