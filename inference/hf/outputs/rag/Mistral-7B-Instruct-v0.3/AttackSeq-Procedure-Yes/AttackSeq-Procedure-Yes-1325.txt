 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives for files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke is using Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media, which means they are searching for data on removable drives. However, there is no mention of Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data, which is the technique used for clipboard data collection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since the related TTPs do not indicate the use of a clipboard stealer, it is less likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives for files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives for files.
   - The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke is searching for data on removable drives (T1025), but there is no mention of clipboard data collection (T1115).
