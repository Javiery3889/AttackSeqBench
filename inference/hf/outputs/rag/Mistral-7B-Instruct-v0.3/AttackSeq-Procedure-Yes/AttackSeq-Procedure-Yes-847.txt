 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include "Lateral Movement" and "Exploitation of Remote Services". Lateral Movement is a tactic used by attackers to move from one compromised system to another within a network, while "Exploitation of Remote Services" is a technique under the Lateral Movement tactic that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase. The discovery phase is not directly related to lateral movement or exploitation of remote services, but it provides the attackers with the necessary information to identify potential targets for lateral movement. The most plausible sequence would be: Discovery (Gain knowledge of systems, users, and data) -> Exploitation of Remote Services (Lateral Movement) -> Installation of Additional Persistence Points.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
