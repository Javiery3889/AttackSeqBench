 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the WastedLocker ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom, after it has been deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic involved is Impact, and the Technique used is T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact. This technique is commonly associated with ransomware attacks, where data is encrypted to cause disruption and demand a ransom.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the deployment of WastedLocker ransomware, which is a known data-encrypting malware. The related TTPs also confirm that the Tactic and Technique involved are associated with data encryption for impact. Therefore, it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the WastedLocker ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom in the Impact phase, after it has been deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase.
