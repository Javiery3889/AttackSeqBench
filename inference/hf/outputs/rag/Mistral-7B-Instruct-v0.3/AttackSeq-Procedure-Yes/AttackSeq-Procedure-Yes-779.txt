 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Earth Empusa will utilize ActionSpy to evade static analysis and establish persistence after delivering ActionSpy spyware via a phishing page.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the attacker may use Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1036.005) to match a legitimate name or location, and Tactic: Persistence (T1574.002) to use DLL side-loading for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the initial access phase (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and the use of ActionSpy spyware. After initial access, it is likely that the attacker would want to evade detection (Defense Evasion) by impersonating a legitimate Uyghur video app and evade static analysis. Then, to maintain persistence, they would prompt users to enable the Accessibility service under the guise of a memory garbage cleaning service, which aligns with T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that Earth Empusa will utilize ActionSpy to impersonate a legitimate Uyghur video app and evade static analysis before establishing persistence by prompting users to enable its Accessibility service under the guise of a memory garbage cleaning service. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
