 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through spearphishing emails, specifically T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This technique often involves sending a malicious file as an email attachment.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions a Microsoft Word document (Richard_Johnson.doc), which is a type of file that can contain VBS macros. If the initial access was gained through a spearphishing email (T1566.001), it is plausible that the attacker would use the compromised system to execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through spearphishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - It is plausible that the attacker would use the compromised system to execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document (Richard_Johnson.doc).
   - Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) -> Execution (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter) with the script being a VBS macro embedded in the Microsoft Word document.
