 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: FIN4 is known to organize targets using unique campaign codes for resource development. The question asks if it is likely they will use spearphishing emails to capture usernames and passwords during reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Reconnaissance and Resource Development, with specific techniques related to phishing and email account compromise.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Reconnaissance is about gathering information about a target before an attack. The Technique T1598.001-Spearphishing Service and T1598-Phishing for Information are methods used to gather information, which aligns with the Reconnaissance Tactic. The Tactic of Resource Development is about building and maintaining access to resources for future operations. The Technique T1586.002-Email Accounts is a method used to gain access to email accounts, which can be used for further reconnaissance or future operations.

Given that FIN4 is organizing targets and then developing resources (email accounts), it is likely that they will use spearphishing emails (T1598.001 or T1598) to gather information (Reconnaissance) and capture usernames and passwords, as these are steps that typically occur in sequence in a cyber attack. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
