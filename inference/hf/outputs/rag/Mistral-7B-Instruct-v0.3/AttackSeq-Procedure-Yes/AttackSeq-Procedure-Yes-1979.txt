 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will send emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT in order to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic is being used through T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment. However, the question mentions that the adversary has already developed VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts. This suggests that the Initial Access has already been achieved through a different method (compromising webservers), and the adversary is now using the VPS infrastructure for command and control (C2) purposes.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the adversary sending emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT. The related TTPs suggest that the Initial Access has been achieved through a different method, and the current focus seems to be on using the VPS infrastructure for C2. Therefore, it is unlikely that the adversary will send emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT to gain initial access.

In conclusion, the answer is B: No. The adversary has already achieved Initial Access through compromising webservers and is now using the VPS infrastructure for C2 purposes, not for sending emails to gain initial access.
