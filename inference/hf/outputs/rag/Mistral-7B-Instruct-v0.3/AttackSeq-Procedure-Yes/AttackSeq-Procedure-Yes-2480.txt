 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of acquiring infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development after initiating an attack.
2. The related TTPs provided include "Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains" and "Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains", which both pertain to the creation of infrastructure, specifically domains, during the resource development phase of an attack.
3. The attack described in the question involves spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems. This initial access technique (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) is not directly related to the creation of infrastructure.
4. Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would proceed to the resource development phase, where they would acquire infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers.
5. Thus, the most likely answer is "Yes".
