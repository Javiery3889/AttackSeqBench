 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors used AntSword webshell to execute commands for system and user discovery before running commands to discover files and folders on the compromised system.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) and the attacker's next steps may involve Discovery tactics, such as File and Directory Discovery (T1083).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after initial access. Given that the initial access was achieved through a public-facing application exploit, it is likely that the attackers would first establish a foothold on the system using a webshell (T1055.002). Once the initial access is established, it is common for attackers to perform system and user discovery (T1087) to understand the environment and identify potential targets. After system and user discovery, they may proceed to discover files and directories (T1083) to find valuable information or further exploit the system. In this case, using AntSword webshell for system and user discovery before discovering files and folders aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) to install webshells (T1055.002)
   - Discovery: System and User Discovery (T1087 using AntSword webshell)
   - Discovery: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)

Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the threat actors used the AntSword webshell to execute commands for system and user discovery before running commands to discover files and folders on the compromised system.
