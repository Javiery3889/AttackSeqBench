 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Shuckworm, a known cyber espionage malware, is likely to download additional payloads after communicating with their Command and Control (C&C) servers using HTTP requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Shuckworm uses T1071.001 - Web Protocols for communication with its C&C servers. This technique is often used by malware to receive commands and updates from their C&C servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Shuckworm is a cyber espionage malware, and it is common for such malware to download additional payloads to maintain control over compromised systems. The download of additional payloads allows the malware to perform various tasks, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and persistence. Therefore, it is plausible that Shuckworm would download additional payloads after communicating with its C&C servers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after communicating with their C&C servers using HTTP requests.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Shuckworm uses T1071.001 - Web Protocols for communication with its C&C servers.
   - Shuckworm is a cyber espionage malware, and it is common for such malware to download additional payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Shuckworm would download additional payloads after communicating with its C&C servers, making the answer "Yes" the most likely choice.
