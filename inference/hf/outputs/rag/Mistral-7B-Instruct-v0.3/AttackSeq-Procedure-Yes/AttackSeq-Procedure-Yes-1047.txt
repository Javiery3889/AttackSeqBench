 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Emissary Panda, after installing webshells for persistence in Microsoft SharePoint, performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit before using the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement (T1210) and the Technique of Exploitation of Remote Services (T1027). However, there is no mention of the EternalBlue exploit (T1086) or the HyperBro backdoor (T1025) in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the EternalBlue exploit and HyperBro backdoor, but they are not among the related TTPs. This suggests that these TTPs are not likely to be part of the sequence of events described in the question.

4. The question asks about a specific sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs do not support the sequence that includes the EternalBlue exploit and HyperBro backdoor. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include these elements.

Final Answer: No. Emissary Panda did not likely perform lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit before using the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.
