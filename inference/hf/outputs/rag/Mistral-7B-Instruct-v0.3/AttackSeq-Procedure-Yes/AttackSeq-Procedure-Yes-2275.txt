 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Regin, after using its C&C capabilities and managing compromised systems, is likely to leverage its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files during the process of gathering operational intelligence for Collection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery, both under the Discovery tactic. These TTPs involve discovering information about remote systems and file and directory discovery, respectively.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Regin is known to use C&C capabilities and modules like C375h and 1Bh for managing communications and compromised systems. However, the question asks about scanning for deleted files, which is not a typical behavior of Regin according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The related TTPs do not suggest that Regin uses file and directory discovery for scanning deleted files, especially in the context of operational intelligence gathering for Collection.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible to say that Regin is not likely to leverage its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files during the process of gathering operational intelligence for Collection. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
