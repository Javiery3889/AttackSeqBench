 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has performed Discovery activities, specifically T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1049-System Network Connections Discovery. These TTPs suggest that the attacker has gathered information about the systems and their network connections.

3. Compare and Evaluate: After reconnaissance activities, it is common for an attacker to install malware or implants on the targeted system. In this case, BlackEnergy 3. Once installed, these implants would typically communicate with Command-and-Control servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. Employee-enabled macro execution could be a method used to install the malware on the network. Therefore, it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
