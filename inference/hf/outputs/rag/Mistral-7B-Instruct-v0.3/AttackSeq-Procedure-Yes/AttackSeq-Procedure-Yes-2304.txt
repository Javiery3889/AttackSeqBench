 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will move laterally to a domain controller.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement and Technique T1021.006 - Windows Remote Management, which includes tools like WinRM.
3. The question also mentions the Tactic of Credential Access and Technique T1003.001 - LSASS Memory, which includes the use of Mimikatz.
4. After gaining credentials through Mimikatz, the adversary may use these credentials to move laterally within the network.
5. WinRM is a remote management protocol that can be used for lateral movement in Windows environments, making it a plausible choice for the adversary to use after gaining credentials.
6. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will move laterally to a domain controller using WinRM after executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials.
7. The answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with the attack sequence in the question.
