 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Turla is likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Turla is involved in both the Discovery and Collection tactics. Specifically, T1025-Data from Removable Media and T1005-Data from Local System are related to the Collection tactic, suggesting that Turla collects data from removable media and the local system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the collection of files from USB drives and recent files. The TTPs T1025-Data from Removable Media and T1005-Data from Local System both involve data collection, and USB drives are a type of removable media. Since Turla has already implemented file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase, it is plausible that Turla would use its backdoor plugins to collect files from USB drives during the collection phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Turla would use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase (Answer: Yes).
