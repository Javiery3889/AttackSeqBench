 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation (T1547) and the Technique of Kernel Modules and Extensions (T1547.006). This suggests that the attackers are trying to gain higher-level access to the system. The Collection TTP (T1005) also indicates that the attackers are interested in data collection. However, the Collection TTP is not directly related to the question about persistence points.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about installing persistence points during lateral movement, which is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. After gaining access to the system (as suggested by the Collection TTP), it is likely that attackers would want to ensure they can maintain access for future activities, such as data collection. Installing further persistence points during lateral movement would help them achieve this goal.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before data collection.
   - After gaining access to the system (suggested by the Collection TTP), it is likely that attackers would want to maintain access for future activities, such as data collection.
   - Installing further persistence points during lateral movement would help them achieve this goal.
   - Therefore, the answer is Yes. Attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data.
