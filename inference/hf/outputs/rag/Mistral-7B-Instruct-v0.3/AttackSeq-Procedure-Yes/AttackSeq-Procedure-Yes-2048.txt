 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Charming Kitten, after creating fake websites to obtain credentials, targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Charming Kitten has been known to use Social Media Accounts (T1585.001) and Email Accounts (T1586.002) for Resource Development. This suggests that they have a history of creating and using fake accounts to gather information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Reconnaissance phase, which is about gathering information on targets. Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists would be a plausible method for Charming Kitten to gather information on non-Iranian researchers, as it would allow them to blend in and gain access to information they wouldn't otherwise have.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase. Given their history of using Social Media Accounts and Email Accounts for Resource Development, it is likely that they would use similar tactics for Reconnaissance. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
