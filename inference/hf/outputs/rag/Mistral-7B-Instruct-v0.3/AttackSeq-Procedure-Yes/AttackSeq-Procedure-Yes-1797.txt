 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used a dropper executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL sideloading and then evaded defenses by deploying a malicious DLL after exploiting the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access on the PCA website.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used exploitation for client execution (T1203) to gain initial access, and they also used DLL sideloading (T1574.002) for defense evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the attackers used DLL sideloading and deployed a malicious DLL after exploiting the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability. The related TTPs confirm that the attackers indeed used DLL sideloading (T1574.002) for defense evasion, which suggests that they likely deployed a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attackers first exploited the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access on the PCA website (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - After gaining initial access, it is likely that they used a dropper executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL sideloading to evade defenses (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading). This would involve deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)
   - DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002)
   - Deployment of a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
