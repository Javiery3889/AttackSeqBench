 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is focusing on data destruction (Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction) and defense evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' is awaiting commands from C2 servers, which suggests that the attacker is in a reconnaissance or command-and-control phase. The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both data destruction tools, but their initial execution has failed according to the question. In this phase, it is less likely for the attacker to immediately deploy these tools for data destruction activities. Instead, they would likely continue with their reconnaissance or command-and-control activities before moving on to data destruction.

Therefore, the answer is B: No, Agrius is not likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and the 'DEADWOOD' malware at this stage.
