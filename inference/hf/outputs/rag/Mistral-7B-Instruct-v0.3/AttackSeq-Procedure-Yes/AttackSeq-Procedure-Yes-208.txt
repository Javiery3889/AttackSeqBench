 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems after SparrowDoor collects system information during the Discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FamousSparrow is involved in Collection activities (T1005-Data from Local System) and that SparrowDoor is part of the Discovery phase (T1082-System Information Discovery). This suggests that FamousSparrow may continue with further Collection activities after the initial Discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that FamousSparrow, after discovering system information, would likely proceed to collect more data, such as reading file contents (T1005-Data from Local System), before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow will read file contents after SparrowDoor collects system information.
   - The related TTPs indicate that FamousSparrow is involved in Collection activities (T1005-Data from Local System) and that SparrowDoor is part of the Discovery phase (T1082-System Information Discovery).
   - Given that FamousSparrow is a likely continuation of SparrowDoor's activities and that Collection is a logical next step after Discovery, it is plausible that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
