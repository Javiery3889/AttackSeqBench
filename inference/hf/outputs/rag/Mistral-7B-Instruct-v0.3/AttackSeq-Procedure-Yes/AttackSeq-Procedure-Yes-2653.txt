 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Korplug variant is likely to proceed with collecting information about the system and exfiltrating data after establishing persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has established persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) and may have also disabled or modified the system firewall (T1562.004) to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the attacker has established persistence, which aligns with the TTP T1053.005-Scheduled Task. After establishing persistence, it is common for an attacker to gather information about the system (Tactic: Collection) before exfiltrating data (Tactic: Exfiltration). The question specifically mentions the use of the GetSystemTime function for system time discovery, which falls under the Collection tactic. The Korplug variant is known to collect system information and exfiltrate data, so it is plausible that it would perform these actions in this sequence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant is likely to proceed with collecting information about the system and exfiltrating data after establishing persistence.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has established persistence and may have also disabled or modified the system firewall.
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Korplug variant would gather system information (Collection) before exfiltrating data (Exfiltration).
   - The question mentions the use of the GetSystemTime function for system time discovery, which falls under the Collection tactic.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Korplug variant would proceed with collecting information about the system, including using the GetSystemTime function for system time discovery, before exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
