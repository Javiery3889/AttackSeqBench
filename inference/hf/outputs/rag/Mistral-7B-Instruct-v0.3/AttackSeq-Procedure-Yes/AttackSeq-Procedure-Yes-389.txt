 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Vyveva is likely to obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are related to collection techniques, specifically archiving files via library and custom methods. There is no mention of file and directory discovery in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about discovery activities, but the related TTPs do not suggest that Vyveva performs discovery activities before compression. The TTPs focus on collection techniques, not discovery. Therefore, it is less likely that Vyveva would obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "No". Vyveva is not likely to obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.
