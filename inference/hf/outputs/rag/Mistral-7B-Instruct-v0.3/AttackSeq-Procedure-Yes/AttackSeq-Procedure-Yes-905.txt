 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Dexphot is likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves process hollowing, which is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic (T1055.012). However, the related TTPs do not mention any specific technique for Privilege Escalation.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Process hollowing is a method used to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage. This technique is often used to evade detection and obfuscate activities. After successfully evading detection by using process hollowing, it would be logical for an attacker to further evade detection by using fileless techniques. Fileless techniques do not rely on files on the disk, making them harder to detect. Therefore, Dexphot is likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing (used to load executables)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Fileless Techniques (used to further evade detection and obfuscate activities)
