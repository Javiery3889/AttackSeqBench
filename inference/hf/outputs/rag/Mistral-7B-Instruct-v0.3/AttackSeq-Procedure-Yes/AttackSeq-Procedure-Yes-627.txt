 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware is delivered via a .7z file containing a .hta file and executes a VB Script to drop and open a decoy Microsoft Word file. This sequence aligns with Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File, which involves the use of malicious files to deliver malware.

2. The question then asks if the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped .exe file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension. This sequence of actions is similar to Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic, which involves the use of Visual Basic Scripts to execute files, create processes, and perform other actions.

3. The question does not mention any actions that would contradict the creation of a new process to execute the dropped .exe file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes".
