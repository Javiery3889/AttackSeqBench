 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the KONNI malware will achieve persistence on the victim's system and then steal credentials from browsers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware may use techniques for Persistence (T1547.009-Shortcut Modification) and Credential Access (T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers). However, there is no indication of Privilege Escalation (T1547.009-Shortcut Modification is also associated with Persistence, but not necessarily Privilege Escalation).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about two separate actions: persistence and credential theft. The related TTPs suggest that the malware may perform both of these actions. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with this scenario, as it implies that the malware will first achieve persistence and then move on to credential theft.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the KONNI malware will achieve persistence and then steal credentials.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware may perform both of these actions.
