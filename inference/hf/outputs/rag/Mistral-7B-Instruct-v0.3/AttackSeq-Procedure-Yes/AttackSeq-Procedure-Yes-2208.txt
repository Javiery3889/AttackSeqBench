 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about Earth Lusca's potential use of application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for command and control after establishing persistence on compromised systems.
2. The related TTPs provided include T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation (Command and Control) and T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service (Defense Evasion), which suggest that Earth Lusca may use these techniques to disguise their command and control activities.
3. Additionally, the TTP T1001-Data Obfuscation is also provided, which indicates that Earth Lusca might use data obfuscation to make their command and control traffic appear normal and evade detection.
4. Therefore, based on the provided TTPs, it is plausible that Earth Lusca would leverage application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for command and control to mimic normal traffic and evade detection.

So, the final answer is "Yes".
