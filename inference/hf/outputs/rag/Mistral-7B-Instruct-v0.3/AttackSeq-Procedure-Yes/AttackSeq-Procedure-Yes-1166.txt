 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability and infects a target with Plexor malware. The question asks if it is likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that after gaining initial access, Longhorn may perform system information discovery (T1082) and file and directory discovery (T1083). However, there is no mention of them following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing these actions.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access. The answer choice "Yes" would imply that Longhorn follows guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system and file/directory discovery. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence. Instead, they suggest that Longhorn performs system and file/directory discovery without following the guidelines on tactics to avoid detection first. Therefore, the answer "No" is more plausible.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: After Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability and infecting a target with Plexor malware, it is not likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery. This is because the related TTPs indicate that they perform system and file/directory discovery without any mention of following the guidelines on tactics to avoid detection first. Therefore, the final answer is "B: No".
