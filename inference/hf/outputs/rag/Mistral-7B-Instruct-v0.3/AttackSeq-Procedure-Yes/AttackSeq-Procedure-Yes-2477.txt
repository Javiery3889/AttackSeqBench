 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will use Empire stagers to create multiple stages for obfuscating the command-and-control channel after employing reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Defense Evasion (T1620) with Reflective Code Loading (T1620-Reflective Code Loading), Command and Control (T1104) with Multi-Stage Channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels), and Execution (T1059) with PowerShell (T1059.001-PowerShell).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of Empire stagers to create multiple stages for obfuscating the command-and-control channel. The related TTPs suggest that the attack sequence includes the use of Empire (T1059.001-PowerShell) and multi-stage channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels). Using multiple stages is a common technique to obfuscate the command-and-control channel, and the Empire framework allows for the creation of multiple stages. Therefore, it is plausible that the adversaries will use Empire stagers to create multiple stages for obfuscating the command-and-control channel.
