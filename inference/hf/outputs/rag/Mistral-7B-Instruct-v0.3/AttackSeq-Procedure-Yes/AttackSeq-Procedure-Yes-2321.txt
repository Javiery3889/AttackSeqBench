 Final Answer: Yes (A)

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Shamoon malware, after entrenching itself as a service for persistence and executing the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver for its destructive operations, will eventually overwrite disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Tactic of Impact and the Technique of Data Destruction (T1485) and Disk Structure Wipe (T1561.002). These TTPs are associated with malware that aims to destroy data and disrupt systems, which aligns with the behavior of Shamoon malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the TTPs provided, as it suggests that Shamoon will eventually overwrite the disk's boot records and target both user and system data, which is consistent with the destructive nature of the Shamoon malware.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the TTPs provided, as it suggests that Shamoon will not overwrite the disk's boot records or target both user and system data, which is not consistent with the behavior of the Shamoon malware.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question is:
- Tactic: Impact
  - Technique: T1485-Data Destruction (Shamoon entrenches itself and executes the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver for its destructive operations)
  - Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe (Shamoon eventually overwrites the disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and targets both user and system data)
