 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome before attackers utilized heap spraying techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript). These TTPs suggest that the attack starts with the delivery of malicious content (JavaScript code) to the victim, which then leads to the execution of the attacker's code.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events leading to heap spraying, which is a technique used for gaining an arbitrary read/write primitive and executing shellcode payloads (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1086). The related TTPs suggest that the attack starts with Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript), which aligns with the sequence of events leading to heap spraying. Therefore, it is likely that the attack started with the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, before moving on to heap spraying techniques.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events leading to heap spraying.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attack starts with Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript), which aligns with the sequence of events leading to heap spraying.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attack started with the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, before moving on to heap spraying techniques.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
