 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that LightNeuron will collect emails and local files automatically for exfiltration after discovering system network configurations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that LightNeuron is using Discovery techniques (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery) to gather information about the system network configurations. Additionally, it is also using Collection techniques (T1005-Data from Local System) to collect data from the local system. However, there is no mention of Exfiltration techniques (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) in the question or related TTPs, which suggests that the focus is on data collection, not exfiltration at this stage.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that LightNeuron is in the data collection phase and has not yet moved on to the exfiltration phase. Therefore, it is not likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs indicate that LightNeuron is using Discovery and Collection techniques, but there is no mention of Exfiltration techniques.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that LightNeuron is in the data collection phase and has not yet moved on to the exfiltration phase.
   - Final Answer: No.
