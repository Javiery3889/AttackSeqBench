 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server after employing obfuscation and self-deletion techniques for defense evasion and execution. However, the question does not mention any technique related to command and control (C2) communication.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1216.001-PubPrn) and Tactic: Execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic). These TTPs indicate that the VBS script is being used for obfuscation (T1216.001) and execution (T1059.005).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about C2 communication, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about C2 communication. The obfuscation and self-deletion techniques mentioned in the question are not directly related to C2 communication. Therefore, it is not likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server after employing these techniques.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about C2 communication.
   - The obfuscation and self-deletion techniques mentioned in the question are not directly related to C2 communication.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server after employing these techniques.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
