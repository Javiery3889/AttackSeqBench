 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten (an adversary group known for using C&C communication and data exfiltration) will employ spear phishing and social engineering to establish initial access on target machines.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are all related to Initial Access, which is the first stage of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The techniques mentioned are Phishing (T1566), Spearphishing Link (T1566.002), and Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001). These techniques are used to establish initial access to a target system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the question asks about establishing initial access, and the related TTPs provided are all about Initial Access techniques, it is reasonable to assume that Rocket Kitten would likely use spear phishing and social engineering (either through a link or an attachment) to gain initial access to target machines.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access (T1078) through Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) or Spearphishing Link (T1566.002), followed by the use of C&C communication and data exfiltration (which is already known about Rocket Kitten).
