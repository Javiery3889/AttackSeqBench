 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it's likely that a PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware after evading defenses by operating in memory and using a specific DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. This technique involves the use of PowerShell for command and scripting execution. The related TTPs do not directly indicate communication with C2 servers or downloading payloads, but they do suggest the use of PowerShell, which can be used for such activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of PowerShell, which is a known tool for initial access and command and control in various malware families, including Ursnif and GandCrab. The evasion technique used (operating in memory and using a specific DCOM object) is often employed to bypass security measures and execute malicious code without leaving traces on the disk. Given that the PowerShell script has already bypassed defenses and executed malicious code, it is likely that it will proceed with further stages of an attack, such as communicating with C2 servers and downloading payloads.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
