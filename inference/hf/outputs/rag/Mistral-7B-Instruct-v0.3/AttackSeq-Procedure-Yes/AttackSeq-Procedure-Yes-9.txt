 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the malware's actions after achieving persistence and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the malware is using the T1012-Query Registry technique as part of the Discovery tactic.
3. Querying the registry is a common method for discovery, allowing the malware to identify victim machines and gather information about the system.
4. Since the malware has already achieved persistence and is using defense evasion techniques, it is likely that it would continue with its intended purpose, which includes discovery.
5. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process.
