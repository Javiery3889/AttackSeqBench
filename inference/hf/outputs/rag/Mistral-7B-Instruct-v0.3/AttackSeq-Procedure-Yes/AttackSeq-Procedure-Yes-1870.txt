 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Scote malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) and Web Service (Technique: T1102-Web Service) for bidirectional communication. This suggests that the malware communicates with a C2 server, but does not necessarily imply that it retrieves C2 information from third-party services like Pastebin or Google+.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about retrieving C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts. However, the related TTPs do not suggest that this is a common or likely sequence of TTPs for Scote malware. Instead, they indicate that the malware communicates with a C2 server, which is not the same as retrieving C2 information from third-party services.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that Scote malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.
