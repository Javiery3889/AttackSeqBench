 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the injection of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) payload into a new process, which aligns with the Technique T1055-Process Injection.
2. The RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk, which is a defense evasion technique (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection).
3. The attackers are then likely to establish a connection with the RAT control server, which is a Command and Control (C2) activity (Tactic: Command and Control).
4. The question specifically mentions the domain chickenkiller.com, which is associated with a free dynamic DNS service. This suggests that the C2 server's IP address may change dynamically, and DNS is often used for C2 communication (Technique: T1071.004-DNS).
5. Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers will connect the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com, as this sequence of TTPs aligns with the information provided in the question.
