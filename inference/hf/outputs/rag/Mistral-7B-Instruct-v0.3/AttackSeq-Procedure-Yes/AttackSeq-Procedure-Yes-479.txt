 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Trickbot, after stealing credentials and information, will connect to a URL to download its payload, decode it using certutil.exe, and execute it during the Command and Control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Trickbot is known to access credentials from web browsers (T1555.003) and that it may use techniques for Defense Evasion, such as Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that aligns with the known behavior of Trickbot. After stealing credentials, it is likely that Trickbot will connect to a URL to download its payload (T1078.001 - Initial Access via Web Drive-by Compromise). The downloaded payload may be obfuscated or encoded, which would align with the Defense Evasion technique T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. Once the payload is decoded, it can be executed, which would fit the Command and Control phase (T1059.001 - Command and Control). The tool certutil.exe is often used for decoding purposes, so it is plausible that Trickbot could use it for this purpose.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Trickbot will connect to a URL to download its payload, decode it using certutil.exe, and execute it during the Command and Control phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
