 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if ZoxPNG, after exploiting the victim's proxy settings for defense evasion, is likely to establish contact with the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using Command and Control tactics and Web Protocols (T1071.001) for communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP T1071.001 specifically mentions the use of web protocols for command and control. Given that ZoxPNG has already exploited the proxy settings for defense evasion, it is likely that it will use the same method (web protocols) to communicate with the C2 server. One common method for initial communication in such cases is an HTTP GET request.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Defense Evasion (T1027) - Exploit proxy settings
- Command and Control (T1059) - Establish a connection with the C2 server
- Command and Control (T1071) - Use web protocols for command and control, specifically an initial HTTP GET request for command and control.

So, the answer is "Yes", ZoxPNG is likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request for command and control.
