 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for the app to send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Exfiltration (T1041) and Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003). These TTPs suggest that the malware is sending data (exfiltrating) to a remote server, but not necessarily using the FTP protocol.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about sending data via HTTP and FTP. The TTPs do not explicitly mention FTP, but they do mention sending data over a non-C2 channel (HTTP could be considered a non-C2 channel). Therefore, it is plausible that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely for the app to send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP. The related TTPs suggest that the malware is sending data (exfiltrating) to a remote server, but not necessarily using the FTP protocol. Since HTTP is a common non-C2 protocol for data transfer, it is plausible that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
