 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the "Machete" malware, after establishing persistence and installing itself, will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the malware is involved in Collection (Tactic) activities, specifically Keylogging (T1056.001) and Audio Capture (T1123). Additionally, there is no Credential Access (Tactic) technique mentioned, which suggests that the malware is not primarily focused on stealing credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about three different Collection techniques (Keylogging, Audio Capture, and Clipboard Hijacking). All three of these techniques are included in the related TTPs, which suggests that it is likely that the malware will perform these actions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware has already established persistence and installed itself, which is a common tactic for malware to remain on a system and perform its intended actions.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in Collection activities, specifically Keylogging, Audio Capture, and potentially Clipboard Hijacking.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information from the target machine.
