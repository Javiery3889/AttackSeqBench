 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Shellbot is likely to establish Command and Control (C&C) communication using an IRC channel after gathering information about the infected host. Shellbot is a type of malware, and one of its known TTPs (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071 - Command and Control) is to communicate with its C&C server. However, the question does not mention any specific C&C communication method, and it only mentions the information gathering phase (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is gathering system information, but they do not provide any information about the C&C communication method used by Shellbot.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide enough information to definitively say whether Shellbot will use an IRC channel for C&C communication. However, Shellbot is known to use various C&C communication methods, including IRC, but also HTTP, HTTPS, and custom protocols. Since the question does not mention any specific C&C communication method, the most plausible answer is that Shellbot may use other methods besides an IRC channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Shellbot is likely to establish C&C communication using an IRC channel after gathering system information.
   - The related TTPs do not provide any information about the C&C communication method used by Shellbot.
   - Shellbot is known to use various C&C communication methods, but the question does not mention any specific method.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Shellbot will use an IRC channel for C&C communication based on the information provided in the question.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
