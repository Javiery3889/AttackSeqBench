 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the XAgent app, after executing itself in the background on iOS 7 devices while hiding its icon and restarting when terminated, will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in both collecting and sending data (Exfiltration) and discovering system information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the XAgent app is collecting system information (as per T1082-System Information Discovery) and sending it out via HTTP to its C&C server (implied by the mention of T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). Geo-location data is a type of system information that can be valuable for an attacker. Therefore, it is plausible that the XAgent app would collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the XAgent app will collect geo-location data.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in collecting and sending data, and geo-location data is a type of system information.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the XAgent app would collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
