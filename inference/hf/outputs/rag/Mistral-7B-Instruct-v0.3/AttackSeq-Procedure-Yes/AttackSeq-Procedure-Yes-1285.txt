 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase, given that Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking during the Defense Evasion phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) and Rundll32 (T1218.011-Rundll32) for defense evasion. These techniques do not inherently imply the use of SSL for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of DLL hijacking and Rundll32 does not provide any evidence that TClient will use SSL for communication with the C&C server. In fact, the use of SSL is more commonly associated with Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1086-Secure Sockets Layer Tunneling, which was not mentioned in the question or related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking and Rundll32 for defense evasion, which does not imply the use of SSL for command and control.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
