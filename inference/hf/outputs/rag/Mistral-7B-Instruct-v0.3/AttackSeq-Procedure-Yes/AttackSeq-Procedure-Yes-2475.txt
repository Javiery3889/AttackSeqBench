 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution before establishing persistence through hijacked Component Object Model (COM) references.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Privilege Escalation and Technique T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking. However, the Tactic of Persistence is also mentioned with the same Technique T1546.015. This suggests that the attackers might use Component Object Model Hijacking for both Privilege Escalation and Persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, specifically if the attackers first exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution and then established persistence through hijacked COM references. The related TTPs do not indicate that the attackers would first exploit the vulnerability for client execution before establishing persistence. Instead, they suggest that the attackers might use Component Object Model Hijacking for both purposes. Therefore, it is less likely that the attackers would first exploit the vulnerability for client execution before establishing persistence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events in an attack.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attackers might use Component Object Model Hijacking for both Privilege Escalation and Persistence, but they do not indicate a specific sequence.
   - Based on this information, it is less likely that the attackers would first exploit the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution before establishing persistence through hijacked COM references.
   - Final Answer: No.
