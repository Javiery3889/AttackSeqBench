 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the group will use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment before extensively leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement and Technique T1080-Taint Shared Content, which involves moving within a network by using shared resources, and T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares, which is a specific method of lateral movement using SMB and Windows Admin Shares.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after privilege escalation and malware installation. The TTPs provided do not suggest that the group will use network discovery tools like Nmap and ping before using Wmiexec for lateral movement. Instead, the TTPs suggest that the group will use SMB and Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement (T1021.002). The use of Nmap and ping for network discovery is more likely to occur before the initial lateral movement, not after privilege escalation and malware installation. Therefore, the answer is "No".
