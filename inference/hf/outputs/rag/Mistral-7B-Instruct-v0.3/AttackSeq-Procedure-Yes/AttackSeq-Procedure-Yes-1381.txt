 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters after using Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Reconnaissance (T1596.005-Scan Databases) and Discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery) techniques. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the target network and its services.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the discovery of specific types of systems (outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol) in the target network. Given that the attacker has already used network service discovery (T1046), it is plausible that they would continue to discover and enumerate services within the network, which could include the mentioned systems.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
