 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot, and the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion. However, T1529 is about shutting down or rebooting the system, not deleting files.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not mention any TTP related to system shutdown or reboot, but it does mention encrypted communication for data exfiltration, which is more in line with T1086-Data Obfuscation and Exfiltration techniques. Therefore, it is less likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include a system shutdown or reboot, so the answer is B: No.
