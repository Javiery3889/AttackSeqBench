 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files, given that the attack has already executed hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (which aligns with the question's description of executing hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882) and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories (which suggests the attacker may hide artifacts after the initial execution).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first executes hidden code in an Excel document, then hides artifacts, and finally searches for and extracts credentials. The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1203 is related to the initial execution, and T1564.001 is related to hiding artifacts. Therefore, it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first executes hidden code in an Excel document (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution), then hides artifacts (T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories), and finally searches for and extracts credentials.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1203 is related to the initial execution, and T1564.001 is related to hiding artifacts.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
