 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if CosmicDuke, a known advanced persistent threat (APT), is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is involved in both Collection and Exfiltration activities. Specifically, the Collection techniques mentioned are T1056.001-Keylogging, T1005-Data from Local System, which suggest the use of keyloggers and data collection from the local system. The Exfiltration technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration implies that the data collected will be exfiltrated from the system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs before exfiltration. The related TTPs suggest that CosmicDuke collects data (T1056.001 and T1005) and then exfiltrates the data (T1020). However, the question also mentions the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. These tools are commonly used for data collection, specifically for gathering user credentials, sensitive information, and monitoring user activities. Since the question asks about the sequence of TTPs before exfiltration, it is reasonable to assume that these tools would be used for data collection before the data is exfiltrated.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is most plausible that CosmicDuke would use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
