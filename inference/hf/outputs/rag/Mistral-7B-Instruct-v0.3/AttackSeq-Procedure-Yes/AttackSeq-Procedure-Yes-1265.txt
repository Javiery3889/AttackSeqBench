 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after Blind Eagle gains access using a JavaScript downloader. The question specifically mentions PowerShell, DLL loading, AMSI bypass, VBScript, and Startup folder for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention PowerShell (T1059.001) and Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001) for persistence. However, there is no mention of DLL loading or AMSI bypass in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions a sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not include DLL loading or AMSI bypass. Therefore, it is unlikely that the group will utilize PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass before achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include PowerShell for DLL loading and AMSI bypass before achieving persistence. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
