 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT41, a known advanced persistent threat group, conducts reconnaissance activities prior to using spear-phishing emails for initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that APT41 uses email addresses (T1589.002) and spear-phishing (T1598.004) for initial access, but also mentions reconnaissance activities such as targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems (T1598.004).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about reconnaissance activities before spear-phishing. The related TTPs suggest that APT41 does conduct reconnaissance activities, including the specific example of targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems. This aligns with the question, as it suggests that APT41 might gather information about their targets before launching a spear-phishing campaign.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities, such as targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems (T1598.004).
- After gathering enough information, APT41 uses this information to launch a spear-phishing campaign (T1598.004).
- If successful, APT41 gains initial access through the spear-phishing email (T1566).
