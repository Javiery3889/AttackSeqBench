 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten, a known threat actor, impersonated well-known researchers or journalists to send socially engineered email messages for initial access, followed by creating phishing websites that impersonated Instagram and Google services for credential theft.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the threat actor is using spearphishing techniques for both Reconnaissance (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service) and Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link). Additionally, the Defense Evasion technique T1656-Impersonation is also mentioned, which suggests that the threat actor is impersonating legitimate services.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - T1598.001-Spearphishing Service (Reconnaissance): The threat actor researches and identifies targets (well-known researchers or journalists) to send spearphishing emails.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access): The threat actor sends a spearphishing email containing a malicious link to the identified targets.
   - T1656-Impersonation (Defense Evasion): After gaining initial access, the threat actor creates phishing websites that impersonate Instagram and Google services to steal credentials.

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs and the question, it is likely that Charming Kitten impersonated well-known researchers or journalists to send socially engineered email messages for initial access, and then created phishing websites that impersonated Instagram and Google services for credential theft. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
