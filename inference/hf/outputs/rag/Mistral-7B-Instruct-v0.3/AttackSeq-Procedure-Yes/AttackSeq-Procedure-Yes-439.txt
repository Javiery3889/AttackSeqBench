 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will perform certain actions during the Discovery phase after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery tactics and techniques of interest are T1497.001-System Checks (which includes sandbox and virtual environment detection) and T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the Discovery phase, and the related TTPs include T1497.001-System Checks, which includes sandbox and virtual environment detection. Additionally, the question also mentions retrieving installed software lists, gathering process and hard drive information, which are actions that can be part of a system check. The Sednit group is known for using the AutoIt downloader, which can be used to perform these actions. Therefore, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will perform these actions during the Discovery phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will perform sandbox and virtual environment detection, retrieve installed software lists, and gather process and hard drive information using the AutoIt downloader during the Discovery phase after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
