 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of events after the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files, which are often used for initial access and maintaining presence in a system.
2. The attacker has deployed additional variants of Pterodo, indicating that they have a foothold in the system and are looking to expand their control.
3. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (Tactic: T1071) and the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) for communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
4. The question also mentions the use of HTTP requests and interaction with C&C servers, which aligns with the TTP T1071.001.
5. The Tactic: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, but it could be a part of the overall attack strategy, where the attacker uses multiple stages to download additional payloads after establishing command and control. However, the question does not explicitly ask about this, so it is not the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this case.
6. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that Shuckworm will establish command and control by using HTTP requests and interacting with C&C servers before downloading additional payloads.
