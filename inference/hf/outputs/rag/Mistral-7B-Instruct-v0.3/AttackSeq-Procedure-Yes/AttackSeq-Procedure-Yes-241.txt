 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to compromise a cryptocurrency exchange through their AppleJeus campaign for financial theft, given that they have already used a trojanized Celas Trade Pro application with a hidden 'autoupdater' module to persist on the system and communicate with the command and control server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have used malware (T1587.001-Malware) for resource development and have established persistence on the system (T1078-Valid Accounts). These TTPs are consistent with the use of a trojanized application. The Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft suggests that the ultimate goal of the attack is financial gain.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question (trojanized application, persistence, communication with C2, financial theft) aligns with the TTPs related to the AppleJeus campaign, which is known to be used by the Lazarus group for financial theft. Therefore, it is plausible that the Lazarus group will continue their attack sequence and compromise a cryptocurrency exchange for financial theft.
