 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor and downloads and installs an MSI package. This aligns with the Technique T1197-Exploitation for Client Execution.

2. The question then states that the system will drop a backdoor installer. This is a common step in an attack sequence, often preceding the execution of other tools or commands.

3. The question further mentions that UserInstall.exe will prepare for the execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool. This is not explicitly stated in the question, but it is possible that this could be part of the backdoor installer's actions, especially if the backdoor uses BITS Jobs for command and control (as indicated by the Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs in the related TTPs).

4. Finally, the question asks if the backdoor achieves persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers. This is a common persistence technique and could occur after the initial actions, such as dropping the backdoor and preparing for the execution of the BITSadmin tool.

5. Therefore, it is plausible that the sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1197-Exploitation for Client Execution (initial access)
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1055-Command and Scripting (dropping the backdoor installer)
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1197-BITS Jobs (preparing for execution of the BITSadmin tool and achieving persistence)
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1086-PowerShell (loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers)

6. The answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with this plausible sequence of TTPs.
