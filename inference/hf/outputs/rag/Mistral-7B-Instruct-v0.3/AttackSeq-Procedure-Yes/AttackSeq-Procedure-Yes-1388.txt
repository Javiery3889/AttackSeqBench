 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which refers to the use of multiple stages in the command and control process. This suggests that the attacker may use a multi-stage approach, which aligns with the question. The Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that data exfiltration can occur over the C2 channel, which is also relevant to the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Defense Evasion and Command and Control phases. The TTPs provided suggest a multi-stage approach, which includes both Defense Evasion (bypassing blocking) and Command and Control (network requests to C&C servers). The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with this sequence of TTPs, as it suggests that Raccoon stealer will first make network requests to a Telegram channel for Defense Evasion, then communicate with the C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.
