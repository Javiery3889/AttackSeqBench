 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery after identifying potential entry points into medical infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Reconnaissance techniques (T1596.005-Scan Databases) to identify potential entry points and Discovery techniques (T1046-Network Service Discovery) to discover services on the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question and the related TTPs both suggest that the attacker is scanning for services on the network. Network Service Discovery (T1046) is a technique used to discover services on a network, which includes outdated systems and medical devices. Since the attacker has already identified potential entry points, it is likely that they will use Network Service Discovery to find more services on the network.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
