 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Trojan authors will update the Trojan to evade detection.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already used T1112 (Modify Registry) for Defense Evasion and T1556 (Modify Authentication Process) for Persistence. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is already taking steps to hide their presence and maintain access to the compromised host.
3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the attacker has already taken steps to evade detection and maintain persistence, it is plausible that they would continue to take further steps to evade detection, such as recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes (T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information). This would make it more difficult for security solutions to detect the Trojan, as they would not be able to identify it based on its PE header hashes.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- T1112 - Modify Registry (Defense Evasion)
- T1556 - Modify Authentication Process (Persistence)
- T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information (Defense Evasion)
