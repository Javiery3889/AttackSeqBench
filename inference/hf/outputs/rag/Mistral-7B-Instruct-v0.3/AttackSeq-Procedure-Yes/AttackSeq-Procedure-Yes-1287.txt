 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves PowerShell (T1059.001) for initial access and Defense Evasion techniques, including Command Obfuscation (T1027.010) and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the related TTPs. First, the attacker gains initial access through PowerShell (T1059.001). Then, it is likely that they will decode the scripts to drop components for persistence (T1140), such as invoker.ps1, before employing obfuscation methods (T1027.010) for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the answer is "Yes". The attack sequence in the question follows the sequence of TTPs suggested by the related TTPs.
