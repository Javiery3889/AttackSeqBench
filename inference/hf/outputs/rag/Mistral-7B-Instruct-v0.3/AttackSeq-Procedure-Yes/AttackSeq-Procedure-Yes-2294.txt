 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers focused on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline to conduct reconnaissance of their targets' infrastructure. The question is asking about the target selection phase of the attack.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Resource Development (T1584.001-Domains) and Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). These TTPs do not directly indicate the target selection phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs mentioned do not provide enough evidence to suggest that the attackers focused on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline for reconnaissance. The TTPs mentioned are more related to resource development (generating Let's Encrypt certificates) and initial access (spearphishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks about the target selection phase, but the related TTPs do not provide enough evidence to suggest that the attackers focused on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline for this phase. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
