 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Sednit group is likely to create processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments before achieving persistence through the Windows registry entry as implemented by the Delphi downloader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is involved, specifically Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task. This technique involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence on a compromised system. The Tactic of Privilege Escalation is also mentioned, but the specific technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is not directly related to creating processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST'.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about creating processes with specific arguments before achieving persistence. The related TTPs do not suggest that the Sednit group would create processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments before persisting through a scheduled task. In fact, the T1053.005 technique does not involve creating processes with such arguments. Therefore, it is less likely that the Sednit group would follow this sequence of TTPs.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the Sednit group would not create processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments before achieving persistence through the Windows registry entry as implemented by the Delphi downloader. Final Answer: No.
