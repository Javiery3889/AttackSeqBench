 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if OnionDog is likely to establish communication with a C&C server and download other malware after infiltrating the target internal network using a USB worm.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, which are directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server and downloading other malware. The other TTP, Tactic: Impact and Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe, is not directly related to the question as it pertains to data destruction, not malware download.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the likelihood of OnionDog downloading other malware after infiltration. The related TTPs suggest that this is a likely sequence of events, as the Trojan would need to communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions and download additional malware.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that OnionDog would establish communication with a C&C server and download other malware after infiltrating the target internal network. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
