 Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question is asking if APT15, after using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stealing a VPN certificate, deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- The related TTPs suggest that APT15 has performed Initial Access (T1078.002), Privilege Escalation (T1548.002), and Defense Evasion (T1548.002). The Privilege Escalation TTP specifically mentions bypassing User Account Control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if APT15 deployed backdoors and used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings. The related TTPs do not explicitly mention the deployment of backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. However, the Privilege Escalation TTP (T1548.002) mentions bypassing User Account Control, which is a technique that can be used by RoyalCLI.
- It is plausible that APT15 could have used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings (T1548.002) after obtaining domain administrator credentials, but the question does not provide enough information to definitively say they deployed backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Final Answer: B: No. While it is plausible that APT15 used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings, the question asks if they deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS, and the provided information does not support this.
