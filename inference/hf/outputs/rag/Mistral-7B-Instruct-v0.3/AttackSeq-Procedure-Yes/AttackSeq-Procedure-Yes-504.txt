 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, would communicate with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling, which involves using a protocol other than the intended one to communicate with a C2 server. Additionally, T1071.004-DNS is also mentioned, which is a specific technique under the Command and Control tactic that uses DNS for C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of protocol tunneling and DNS/HTTP for C2 communication after the Discovery phase. The related TTPs suggest that these techniques are used for Command and Control, which aligns with the question. Out of the two answer choices, option A: Yes, is the most plausible as it suggests that the backdoor would indeed communicate with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Option B: No, does not align with the question and the related TTPs.

Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
