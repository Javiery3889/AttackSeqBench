 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the driver will connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration after CEIDPageLock collects victim browsing data during the process of tampering with the browser.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is a Drive-by Target (Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004) which is often used to deliver malware through a compromised website. The attack also involves Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS) to communicate with the attacker's server. Additionally, Browser Information Discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217) is used to gather information about the victim's browser.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs related to Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS) and Resource Development (T1608.004) suggest that the attacker would need to communicate with their server to receive further instructions or download additional malicious components. Since the question asks about downloading the homepage configuration, it is reasonable to assume that this would be done through the Command and Control channel. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".
