 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the loader, after employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques in the Defense Evasion phase, will gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase before collecting detailed victim system data and activity through the backdoor.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery phase involves the gathering of system information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques employed in the Defense Evasion phase are used to evade detection and analysis, not to gather information. Therefore, it is not likely that the loader will gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase. Instead, it would be more plausible for the loader to establish a backdoor for further data collection in the Command and Control phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". The loader is unlikely to gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase before collecting detailed victim system data and activity through the backdoor.
