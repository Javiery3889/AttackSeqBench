 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection. The question is about the sequence of TTPs after the Initial Access phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email during the Initial Access phase. There are no TTPs related to Command and Control or Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst in the provided information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since there are no TTPs related to Command and Control or Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst in the question or related TTPs, it is not possible to determine if the automated investigation process was initiated. However, based on the information provided, it is likely that the sequence of TTPs would progress from Initial Access (spear phishing) to later stages such as Command and Control, but there is no evidence to suggest that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst was involved at this point.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Initial Access phase, specifically if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst was involved following Command and Control detection.
   - The related TTPs indicate that APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email during the Initial Access phase, but there are no TTPs related to Command and Control or Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst.
   - Therefore, it is not possible to determine if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst was involved at this point, but it is likely that the sequence of TTPs would progress from Initial Access (spear phishing) to later stages such as Command and Control.
   - Final Answer: B: No, Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst was not likely involved at this point in the sequence of TTPs.
