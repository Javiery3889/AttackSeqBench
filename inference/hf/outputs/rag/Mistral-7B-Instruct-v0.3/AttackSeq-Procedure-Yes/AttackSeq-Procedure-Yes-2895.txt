 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the 'yty' framework, after employing plugins for document listing, keylogging, and screenshot capturing, is likely to exfiltrate the gathered data back to the C2 server using automated methods.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and Technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration, as well as T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using automated methods to exfiltrate data, and that the exfiltration is happening over a Command and Control (C2) channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the 'yty' framework is likely to exfiltrate data using automated methods over a C2 channel. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using automated methods for exfiltration and that this exfiltration is happening over a C2 channel. Therefore, it is plausible that the 'yty' framework, after gathering data with its plugins, would exfiltrate this data using automated methods over a C2 channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the 'yty' framework is likely to exfiltrate data using automated methods over a C2 channel. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using automated methods for exfiltration and that this exfiltration is happening over a C2 channel. Given this information, it is plausible that the 'yty' framework, after gathering data with its plugins, would exfiltrate this data using automated methods over a C2 channel. Therefore, the final answer is Yes.
