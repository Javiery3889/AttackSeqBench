 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Resource Development (T1583.008-Malvertising), Execution (T1204.001-Malicious Link), and Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs T1583.008-Malvertising and T1204.001-Malicious Link suggest that the attacker uses malicious advertising to redirect users to compromised websites. This aligns with the question's requirement of redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites. The TTP T1189-Drive-by Compromise indicates that the initial access to the victim's machine was achieved through known browser vulnerabilities, which is consistent with the question's mention of executing commands on victim machines and obtaining capabilities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Resource Development (T1583.008-Malvertising), Execution (T1204.001-Malicious Link), and Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
   - The TTPs T1583.008-Malvertising and T1204.001-Malicious Link suggest that the attacker uses malicious advertising to redirect users to compromised websites, which aligns with the question's requirement. The TTP T1189-Drive-by Compromise indicates that the initial access to the victim's machine was achieved through known browser vulnerabilities, which is consistent with the question's mention of executing commands on victim machines and obtaining capabilities.
   - Therefore, it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
