 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Derusbi will gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Discovery is being used, specifically T1082-System Information Discovery. This technique is often used to gather information about the target system before further actions are taken.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP of System Information Discovery is typically performed before an attacker binds to a raw socket and initiates communication with the C2 server. This is because the system information gathered can help the attacker tailor their attack to the specific target. In this case, Derusbi modifying the system's global call table and evading detection (which is not a TTP listed) is not necessarily indicative of whether or not system information gathering will occur. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

In summary, it is likely that Derusbi will gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.
