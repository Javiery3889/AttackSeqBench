 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This aligns with Tactic: Command and Control (T1086) and Technique: External Command and Control (T1087).

2. The malware is configured for communication externally, which suggests an intention to exfiltrate data.

3. The exfiltration is scheduled and happens through the C2 channel, as indicated by the TTPs T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

4. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol and communication over HTTPS is a common method to evade detection, as it can bypass security measures and avoid being identified as malicious traffic.

5. The mention of upload limits and randomized intervals in the question further supports the idea that the malware is designed to evade detection by avoiding upload limits and scheduling its exfiltration activities at random intervals.

6. Therefore, it is likely that Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
