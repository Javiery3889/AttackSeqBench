 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the Aria-body backdoor gathering information about the victim's machine after achieving persistence.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the Tactic of Discovery (T1082) is relevant, which suggests that the attacker may be gathering information about the victim's system.
3. The Technique T1082 specifically refers to System Information Discovery, which involves collecting details about the system, such as installed software and Windows version.
4. The persistence techniques mentioned in the question (Startup folder or the 'Run' registry key followed by injecting itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe') do not directly relate to information gathering. However, once the backdoor has persistence, it can perform various actions, including information gathering.
5. Therefore, it is plausible that after achieving persistence, the Aria-body backdoor could gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version, as suggested by the T1082-System Information Discovery TTP.
