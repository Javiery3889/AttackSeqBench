 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the DNSpionage malware will enter its discovery phase to retrieve the infected user's information before using HTTP and DNS for command and control communication with the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses defense evasion techniques such as password-protected macros and string obfuscation, and it also uses DNS for command and control communication (T1071.004-DNS). However, there is no mention of the discovery phase or retrieving user information in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the discovery phase, which typically involves gathering information about the infected system. The related TTPs do not suggest that the malware will enter this phase before using DNS for command and control communication. Instead, the malware is more likely to use defense evasion techniques to avoid detection and then communicate with the C2 server using DNS.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the DNSpionage malware will enter its discovery phase to retrieve the infected user's information before using HTTP and DNS for command and control communication with the C2 server. Therefore, the answer is "No".
