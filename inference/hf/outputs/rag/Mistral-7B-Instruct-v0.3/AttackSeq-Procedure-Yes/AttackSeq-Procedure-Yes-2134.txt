 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if further analysis of a C2 domain used by initial malware will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the threat actor AridViper uses multiple C2 domains (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels) and DNS for C2 communication (T1071.004-DNS). Additionally, they develop resources, such as domains (T1583.001-Domains), to support their operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the identified C2 domain is likely to be associated with additional malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains. Given that the threat actor AridViper is known to use multiple C2 domains (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels), it is plausible that further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples that also use multiple C2 domains (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels) to support their operations (T1583.001-Domains).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given the question asks about the likelihood of finding additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains, and the related TTPs suggest that the threat actor AridViper uses multiple C2 domains, it is plausible that further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
