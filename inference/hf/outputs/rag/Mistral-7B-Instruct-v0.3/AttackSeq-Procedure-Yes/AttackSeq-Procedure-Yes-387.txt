 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Vyveva to have encrypted strings and components for Defense Evasion after Discovery phase activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Vyveva is performing Collection (T1560.003) and Discovery (T1083) activities. However, there is no mention of Defense Evasion (T1027) or any related techniques that involve encryption of strings or components.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Defense Evasion activities, but the related TTPs do not suggest any such activities. The Collection technique T1560.003 is about archiving data via a custom method, which does not necessarily involve encryption for Defense Evasion. The Discovery technique T1083 is about discovering file and directory listings, which is not directly related to Defense Evasion either. Therefore, it is unlikely that Vyveva would have encrypted strings and components for Defense Evasion after Discovery phase activities.

In conclusion, the answer is No. Vyveva is not likely to have encrypted strings and components for Defense Evasion after Discovery phase activities.
