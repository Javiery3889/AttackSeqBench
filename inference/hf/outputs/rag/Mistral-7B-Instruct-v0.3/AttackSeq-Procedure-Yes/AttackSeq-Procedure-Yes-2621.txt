 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses non-standard ports (T1571-Non-Standard Port) and File Transfer Protocols (T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols) for command and control communication. Additionally, it is also known to implement fallback channels (T1008-Fallback Channels).

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the malware uses non-standard ports for communication, it is less likely to use standard FTP and HTTP ports first. The use of non-standard ports suggests an attempt to evade detection by security systems that typically monitor standard ports. Therefore, it is more plausible that the malware will use non-standard ports for communication before implementing fallback channels.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the malware is less likely to use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
