 Final Answer: Yes (A)

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for the Aria-body backdoor to proceed towards data collection activities after gathering system information during the Discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Aria-body backdoor is involved in system network configuration discovery (T1016) and system information discovery (T1082), which are both part of the Discovery tactic. These TTPs suggest that the backdoor is gathering information about the system, but they do not specify that it will stop at this point.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Collection phase, which typically involves data collection activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities. The related TTPs do not explicitly rule out these activities, and in fact, such activities are common after the Discovery phase in a typical attack sequence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Aria-body backdoor would proceed towards data collection activities as part of the Collection phase. Therefore, the answer is Yes (A).
