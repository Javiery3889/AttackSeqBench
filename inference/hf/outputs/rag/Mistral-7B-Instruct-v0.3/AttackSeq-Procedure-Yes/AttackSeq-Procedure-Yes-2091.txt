 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have initially gained access to the network using domain accounts (T1078.002) and are now capable of moving laterally within the network (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the likelihood of lateral movement, which is exactly what T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer represents. The fact that the attackers have administrative-level credentials and have used Cobalt Strike beacon, a tool often used for lateral movement, suggests that they are likely to move laterally within the network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials. The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have initially gained access to the network using domain accounts (T1078.002) and are now capable of moving laterally within the network (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer). Based on this information, it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers (Final Answer: Yes).
