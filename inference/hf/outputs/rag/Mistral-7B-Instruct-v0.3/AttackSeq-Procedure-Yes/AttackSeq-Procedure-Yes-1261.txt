 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after utilizing an AMSI bypass and setting obfuscated registry values.
2. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence, specifically Technique T1547.001, which involves modifying the registry or Startup folder to ensure persistence.
3. The question then asks if Blind Eagle (which is not specified in the question or related TTPs) is likely to place a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat and eventually use a PowerShell script to decrypt obfuscated registry content and establish command and control with njRAT.
4. However, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include placing a VBScript in the Startup folder or executing SystemLogin.bat. The sequence described is: AMSI bypass, obfuscated registry values, and potentially decrypting obfuscated registry content and establishing command and control with njRAT.
5. Therefore, it is not likely that Blind Eagle would follow the sequence described in the question, which includes placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat.
6. The question's sequence seems to be a combination of unrelated TTPs, and it is not plausible that they would be used in this specific order.

Therefore, the answer is No. Blind Eagle is not likely to ensure persistence by placing a VBScript named Login1.vbs in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat before eventually using a PowerShell script to decrypt obfuscated registry content and establish command and control with njRAT.
