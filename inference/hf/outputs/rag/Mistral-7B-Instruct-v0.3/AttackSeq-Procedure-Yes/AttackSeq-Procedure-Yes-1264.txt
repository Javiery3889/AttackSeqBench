 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1) after an obfuscated batch script. This aligns with Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001 - PowerShell, which involves the use of PowerShell for execution.

2. The obfuscated batch script is used to execute the PowerShell script, indicating an attempt to evade detection (Tactic: Defense Evasion).

3. The PowerShell script performs actions to maintain persistence, which is a common tactic used by malware such as njRAT to ensure continued access to the compromised system.

4. The question then asks if it's likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to njRAT establishing command and control over the victim's computer. Given the sequence of TTPs mentioned, it's plausible that the PowerShell script could be a dropper for njRAT, which would explain the persistence actions and the subsequent command and control establishment.

5. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
