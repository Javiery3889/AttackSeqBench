 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, before discovering system details.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the use of a scheduled task (T1053.005) for persistence and execution. This is a common technique used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes for persistence. This is a stealthy and persistent method of maintaining access to a system, which is a characteristic of APTs. To further evade detection, it is plausible for the Konni APT Group to use obfuscation techniques like XOR on their scripts, as this would make it more difficult for security tools to identify and analyze the malicious code.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs and the question, it is likely that the Konni APT Group would use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, before discovering system details such as directory listings and running processes. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
