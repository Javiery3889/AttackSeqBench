 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if GreyEnergy, after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers, is likely to implement stealth techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of public-facing applications for initial access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) and defense evasion techniques such as encrypted/encoded files (T1027.013).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that aligns with the tactics mentioned in the related TTPs. GreyEnergy, known for its stealthy nature, would likely use the initial access to move laterally within the network and then implement defense evasion techniques to hinder analysis and detection. Encrypting modules using AES-256 and running some modules fileless in memory are examples of such defense evasion techniques.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that aligns with the tactics mentioned in the related TTPs, specifically the use of initial access followed by defense evasion techniques.
   - GreyEnergy is known for its stealthy nature, and it would likely use the initial access to move laterally within the network and then implement defense evasion techniques to hinder analysis and detection.
   - Encrypting modules using AES-256 and running some modules fileless in memory are examples of such defense evasion techniques, which are part of the described sequence of TTPs.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Yes (GreyEnergy is likely to implement stealth techniques including pushing only selected modules to selected targets and partially encrypting these modules using AES-256 before running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection).
