 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for the PROMETHIUM malware to send the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS after exfiltrating and compressing/encoding files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware collects data (T1560) and exfiltrates it over a C2 channel (T1041). T1560.003 specifically mentions archiving data via a custom method, which suggests that the malware may use unconventional means to archive the data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about sending the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS. The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware uses a C2 server for exfiltration, and HTTPS is a common protocol for secure data transfer over the internet. The TTP T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method indicates that the malware may use unconventional methods for archiving data, but it does not rule out the use of standard protocols like HTTPS. Self-signed certificates are not explicitly mentioned in the question or related TTPs, but they are often used in malware to bypass security measures and establish a secure connection to the C2 server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to send the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS.
   - The related TTP T1041 suggests that the malware uses a C2 server for exfiltration, and T1560.003 indicates that the malware may use unconventional methods for archiving data.
   - While the TTPs do not explicitly state that the malware will use HTTPS, it is a common protocol for secure data transfer over the internet, and the malware may use it to maintain a secure connection to the C2 server.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will send the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS, especially if the C2 server has hardened infrastructure supported by self-signed certificates.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
