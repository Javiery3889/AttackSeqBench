 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure' based on the observation of two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1027) and Technique: T1497-Endpoint Denial of Service. T1027 is used to evade detection by encoding or encrypting files, while T1499 is a specific type of T1497, which is an endpoint denial of service attack.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers, which aligns with Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1027). However, the question does not provide any evidence that these encoded files were used for launching DDoS attacks or causing a 'total failure' of Next Media's network. The related TTP T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service) is a possible outcome, but it is not directly implied by the provided information.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided information, it is not likely that attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers is more indicative of a defense evasion technique rather than a DDoS attack. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
