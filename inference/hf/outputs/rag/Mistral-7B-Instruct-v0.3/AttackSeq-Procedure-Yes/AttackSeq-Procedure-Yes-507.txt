 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that SombRAT, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, will communicate with C2 servers using proxy tools and protocol tunneling.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Command and Control (Tactic) and Protocol Tunneling (Technique) using proxy tools.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about communication with C2 servers after the Discovery phase, and the related TTPs mention Command and Control and Protocol Tunneling. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that SombRAT will use proxy tools and protocol tunneling (T1090-Proxy and T1572) for communication with C2 servers after the Discovery phase.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Discovery phase: SombRAT performs process discovery and system information discovery (T1086 and T1087)
- Command and Control: SombRAT communicates with C2 servers using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY (T1090)
- Protocol Tunneling: SombRAT implements protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP (T1572)
