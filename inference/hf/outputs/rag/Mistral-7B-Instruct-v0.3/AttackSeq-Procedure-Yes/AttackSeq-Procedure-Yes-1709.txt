 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Turla operators will collect data from local systems and update command and control servers after establishing a hidden foothold for persistent access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Tactic: Collection (T1005) to gather data from local systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after establishing a hidden foothold. The related TTP (T1005) suggests that data collection from local systems is a likely next step. After data collection, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker would update command and control servers to maintain control of infected systems (T1036 - C2 Beacon). Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".

4. Conclusion: The Turla operators are likely to use tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems (T1005) before updating command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems (T1036).
