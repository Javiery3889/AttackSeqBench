 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code before employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion and the Technique T1553.002 - Code Signing. This technique involves attackers using legitimate digital certificates to sign malicious files, making them appear trustworthy to the victim's system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs suggested in the question aligns with the attacker's goal of maintaining a low profile while executing malicious code. First, they would use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to gain access to the system (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078 - Exploit Public-Facing Application). After gaining access, they would execute malicious code (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter). To evade detection, they would then sign the backdoor with a digital certificate (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002 - Code Signing).

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the attacker's goal of maintaining a low profile while executing malicious code and evading detection. The answer is "Yes".
