 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if CosmicDuke, after collecting information using keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase, is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and Technique of T1020-Automated Exfiltration, which involves the use of automated tools to transfer data from the compromised system to an external location. Additionally, the Tactic of Collection and Technique of T1005-Data from Local System is mentioned, which refers to the collection of data from the local system, such as through keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Exfiltration phase, and the related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration. The answer choices are asking if CosmicDuke is likely to perform the described actions during the Exfiltration phase. The TTP T1020-Automated Exfiltration involves the use of automated tools to transfer data, and FTP is a common unencrypted non-C2 protocol used for data transfer. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Collection: T1005-Data from Local System (collecting information using keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer)
   - Exfiltration: T1020-Automated Exfiltration (using FTP to upload the collected information to remote servers)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke, after collecting information during the Collection phase, is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.
