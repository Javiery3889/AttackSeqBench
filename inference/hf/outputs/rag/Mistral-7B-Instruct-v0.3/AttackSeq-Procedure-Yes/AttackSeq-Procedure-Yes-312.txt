 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the BitterAPT group used compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute their threats before setting up Command and Control servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Tactic: Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise), Tactic: Resource Development (T1583.001-Domains), and Tactic: Command and Control (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique used for Initial Access, which aligns with the distribution of threats through compromised websites or phishing schemes.
   - T1583.001-Domains is a technique used for Resource Development, which could be related to setting up Command and Control servers like blitzchatlog.ddns.net.
   - T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is a technique used for Command and Control, which is the final step in the sequence where the attacker communicates with the compromised system and exfiltrates data.

4. The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is:
   - Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) to distribute the malware through compromised websites or phishing schemes.
   - Resource Development (T1583.001-Domains) to set up Command and Control servers.
   - Command and Control (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication) to communicate with the compromised system and exfiltrate data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Yes (the BitterAPT group utilized compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute their threats before setting up Command and Control servers).
