 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Regin, after scanning for deleted files and monitoring network traffic, is likely to gather computer information and encode/embed payload information during exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Collection activities, specifically T1005-Data from Local System and T1119-Automated Collection. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering data from the local system and automating the collection process.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial discovery of information on processes and memory utilization. The most plausible sequence would be:
   - Collection (T1005-Data from Local System): Gathering computer information.
   - Collection (T1119-Automated Collection): Automating the collection process, which could include encoding and embedding payload information.
   - Exfiltration (implied, not explicitly mentioned in the question or related TTPs): The exfiltration of the gathered data, which could include encoded/embedded payload information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Regin is likely to crawl through the file system and gather computer information for the purpose of collection before encoding and embedding payload information during exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Collection activities, which aligns with the question's sequence of TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Regin would first gather computer information (Collection) and then encode/embed payload information during exfiltration.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
