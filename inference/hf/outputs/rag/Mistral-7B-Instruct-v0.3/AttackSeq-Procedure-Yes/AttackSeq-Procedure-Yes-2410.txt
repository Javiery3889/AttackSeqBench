 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before employing process hollowing to bypass UAC.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Privilege Escalation (T1548) and Defense Evasion (T1055), but they do not mention injecting a DLL into Notepad.exe. However, they do mention Process Hollowing (T1055.012), which is a technique used for Defense Evasion and can bypass UAC.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about two separate actions: Privilege Escalation and Process Hollowing. The related TTPs mention Process Hollowing, but they do not mention injecting a DLL into Notepad.exe, which is a different technique for Privilege Escalation. Therefore, it is unlikely that Lokibot would perform both actions in the sequence described in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Lokibot would employ process hollowing to bypass UAC (T1055.012) rather than injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before doing so (T1548.002). Therefore, the answer is B: No.
