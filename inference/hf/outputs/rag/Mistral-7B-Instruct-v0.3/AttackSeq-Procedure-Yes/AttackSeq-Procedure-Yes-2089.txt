 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure, given that they used domain administrative credentials to compromise additional endpoints.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using Domain Accounts for Initial Access, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation. This suggests that the attackers are using domain accounts to gain access, maintain their presence, and escalate their privileges within the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before moving across the infrastructure. The related TTPs show that the attackers are already using domain administrative credentials to compromise endpoints and escalate privileges. This implies that the attackers are indeed aiming to find and use higher-level credentials, such as Domain Administrator, to move across the entire infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure. Given that the attackers are using domain administrative credentials to compromise endpoints and escalate privileges (as indicated by the related TTPs), it is likely that they are aiming to find and use higher-level credentials, such as Domain Administrator, to move across the entire infrastructure. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
