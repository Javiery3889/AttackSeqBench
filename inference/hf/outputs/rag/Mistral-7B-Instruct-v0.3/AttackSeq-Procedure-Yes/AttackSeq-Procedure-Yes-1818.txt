 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the JavaScript backdoor facilitated the exfiltration of mailbox content and attachments after Earth Wendigo established a WebSocket connection for Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique of T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves sending stolen data back to the Command and Control (C2) server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the exfiltration of data, and the related TTPs mention the technique used for exfiltrating data over the C2 channel. Since the JavaScript backdoor is part of the C2 infrastructure, it is plausible that it could be used to execute commands for data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The JavaScript backdoor, being part of the C2 infrastructure, could potentially execute commands to collect email data and send it back to the WebSocket server, which aligns with the Tactic of Exfiltration and Technique of T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
