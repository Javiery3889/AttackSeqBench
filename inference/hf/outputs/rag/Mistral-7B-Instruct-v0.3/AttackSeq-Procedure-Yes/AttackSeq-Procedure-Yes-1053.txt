 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems after deploying malware components.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is relevant, specifically the Technique T1547.001, which involves using registry run keys or startup folder to maintain persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the deployment of malware components such as small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers. These are common steps in an attack sequence for an APT group like Darkhotel. After deploying these malware components, maintaining persistence on the compromised systems is a logical next step to ensure continued access. Using autorun registry settings and malware is a common technique for maintaining persistence (T1547.001), so it is likely that Darkhotel would use this technique.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Darkhotel will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
