 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Derusbi malware is likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions after it gathers system information and beacons this data to the command and control infrastructure via destination port 443.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This TTP refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication, but it does not specify the use of HTTP POST requests to a specific URL like /photos/photo.asp or the use of obfuscated communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that Derusbi malware uses port 443 for its C2 communication, which is typically associated with HTTPS, not HTTP. Furthermore, the question does not mention the use of obfuscated communication or HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is B: No. Derusbi malware is not likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions after it gathers system information and beacons this data to the command and control infrastructure via destination port 443.
