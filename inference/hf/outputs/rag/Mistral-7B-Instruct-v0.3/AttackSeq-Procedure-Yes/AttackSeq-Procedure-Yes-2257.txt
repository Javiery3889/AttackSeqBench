 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Initial Access phase, specifically focusing on the delivery of a malicious zip file via phishing email.
2. The related TTPs provided mention techniques for establishing persistence, which is a common tactic after initial access.
3. T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder and T1053.005-Scheduled Task are both techniques used to ensure persistence.
4. The attacker may first execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level (which is not mentioned in the question or related TTPs), but it is more likely that they would establish persistence before moving on to other stages of the attack.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level, and then ensure persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
