 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Hidden Cobra used Bankshot malware implant for reconnaissance, and the question asks if it is likely that the group would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants during the resource development phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Resource Development tactic and the Domains technique, which suggests that the attacker is creating or acquiring resources, such as domains, for future use.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the distribution of Bankshot implants, which is a technique related to the Initial Access tactic, not Resource Development. The question also mentions the reconnaissance phase, which is completed before the resource development phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that Hidden Cobra would distribute Bankshot implants during the resource development phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the distribution of Bankshot implants during the resource development phase. Instead, it is more likely that the group would use the collected information from the reconnaissance phase to plan and execute the next steps, such as initial access or lateral movement, before moving on to resource development.
