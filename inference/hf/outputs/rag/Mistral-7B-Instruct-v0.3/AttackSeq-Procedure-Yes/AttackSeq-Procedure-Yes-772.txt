 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT after receiving spear phishing emails with RTF document exploits.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves spear phishing (T1566), exploitation (T1203), and the delivery of QuasarRAT (implied by the question). However, there is no mention of a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report as a separate step in the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". The related TTPs do not suggest the presence of a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report as a separate step in the attack sequence. Therefore, it is more likely that the recipients will not be presented with such a document before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT. Therefore, the final answer is "No".
