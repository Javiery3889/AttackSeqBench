 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase, given that they have compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using an archive utility (WinRAR) for data collection and exfiltration to cloud storage (Dropbox). However, there is no mention of custom malware or cURL for Windows in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs that includes the use of custom malware and cURL for Windows, but these TTPs are not present in the related TTPs. The sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with the information provided in the related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase. Given that the related TTPs do not include the use of custom malware or cURL for Windows, it is not likely that these TTPs will be used in the sequence suggested in the question. Therefore, the final answer is No.
