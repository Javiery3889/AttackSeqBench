 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Rocra attackers will use a module to scan the local network and employ admin credentials for lateral movement before leveraging their complex C&C infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have already used a defense evasion technique (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) to bypass security measures. This suggests that they have gained initial access to the network using domain accounts. Additionally, the TTPs also mention lateral movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares), which is a common technique used by attackers to move within a network after initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after defense evasion. The most plausible sequence would be defense evasion (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) followed by lateral movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares). After lateral movement, the attackers could potentially use their complex C&C infrastructure to control infected machines.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Rocra attackers will use a module to scan the local network and employ admin credentials for lateral movement before leveraging their complex C&C infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have already used defense evasion (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) and lateral movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares) techniques.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use admin credentials for lateral movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares) after defense evasion (T1078.002-Domain Accounts), and then leverage their complex C&C infrastructure (not directly mentioned in the question or related TTPs, but a common tactic for attackers after lateral movement).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
