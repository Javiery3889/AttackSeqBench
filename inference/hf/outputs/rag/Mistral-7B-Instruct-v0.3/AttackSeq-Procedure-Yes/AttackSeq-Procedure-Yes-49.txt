 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, which aligns with Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1192-Phishing.
2. The malicious Word document contains a VBS macro, which is a type of malicious file, related to Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File.
3. The VBS macro is used to retrieve an encoded PowerShell script, which is another type of malicious file, also related to Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell.
4. The PowerShell script is then expected to execute, which could lead to the download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This sequence of events aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-PowerShell Scripting.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
