 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the malware is likely to employ InstallUtil.exe to evade detection after creating a scheduled task with appropriate privileges.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Privilege Escalation (T1053), but there is no mention of Defense Evasion or any specific technique related to using InstallUtil.exe for bypassing Smartscreen or AppLocker.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Defense Evasion, but the related TTPs do not suggest this tactic. Instead, they focus on Privilege Escalation. InstallUtil.exe is a tool used for installing .NET Framework components, and while it can be used for Defense Evasion in some cases, there is no indication in the question or related TTPs that this is the intended use here.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about Defense Evasion, but the related TTPs do not suggest this tactic.
   - The question mentions the use of InstallUtil.exe, but there is no indication that it is being used for Defense Evasion in this context.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware will employ InstallUtil.exe to evade detection after creating a scheduled task with appropriate privileges.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
