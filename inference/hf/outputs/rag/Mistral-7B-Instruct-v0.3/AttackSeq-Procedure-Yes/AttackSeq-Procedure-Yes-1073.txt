 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation, given that initial access was achieved through watering hole tactics exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782, followed by execution of custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190), and the attack sequence involves privilege escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access to the system. To maintain persistence and further compromise the system, it is a common tactic for attackers to escalate their privileges (T1068). In this case, using the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges would be a plausible next step for the attackers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the attackers have already gained initial access to the system.
   - To maintain persistence and further compromise the system, it is a common tactic for attackers to escalate their privileges (T1068).
   - Using the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges would be a plausible next step for the attackers, as it allows them to bypass user-level restrictions and gain more control over the system.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
