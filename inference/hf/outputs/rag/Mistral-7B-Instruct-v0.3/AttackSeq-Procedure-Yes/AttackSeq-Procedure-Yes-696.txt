 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals will use remote administration tools to explore financial systems after gaining system administrators' credentials during the discovery phase and evading defenses by reinstalling malware on internal sites of compromised organizations using infrastructure software.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has initially gained access to the system using valid accounts (T1078), which could be system administrator credentials. This is followed by defense evasion (T1078) and lateral movement (T1534). The absence of Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1055-Remote Services, suggests that the attacker has not yet used remote administration tools.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of remote administration tools after gaining system administrators' credentials and evading defenses. The related TTPs show that the attacker has gained access, evaded defenses, and moved laterally within the network but has not yet used remote administration tools. However, the sequence of events suggests that the next logical step would be to use remote administration tools to explore the financial systems, as they would provide the attacker with a means to access and control systems remotely.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker has initially gained access to the system using valid accounts (T1078).
   - To evade defenses, the attacker reinstalled malware on internal sites of compromised organizations using infrastructure software (implied but not explicitly stated in the question or related TTPs).
   - The attacker has moved laterally within the network (T1534).
   - The next logical step would be to use remote administration tools to explore the financial systems, as they would provide the attacker with a means to access and control systems remotely.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
