 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the data collected by Yellow Garuda (Tactic: Collection) from victims' Telegram accounts are likely to be exfiltrated and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041) and the Technique of Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This suggests that the data collected are likely to be sent to a Command and Control (C2) server before being stored.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not specify the method of exfiltration, but the related TTPs suggest that the data are likely to be sent to a C2 server. Since the data are collected in a format that can be easily stored (SQLite database and JSON), it is plausible that they are exfiltrated and then stored in this format.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The data collected by Yellow Garuda are likely to be exfiltrated (T1041) over a C2 channel (implied by the related TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), and since the data are collected in a format that can be easily stored (SQLite database and JSON), it is plausible that they are stored in this format after exfiltration. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
