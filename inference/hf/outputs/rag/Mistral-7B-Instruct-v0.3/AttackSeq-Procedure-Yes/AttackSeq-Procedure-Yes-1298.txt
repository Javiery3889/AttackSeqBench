 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and Defense Evasion techniques. However, T1107 (File Deletion) is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs in the attack campaign. T1107 (File Deletion) is a defense evasion technique, but it is not mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, it is not likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) at this stage.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs in an attack campaign.
   - T1107 (File Deletion) is a defense evasion technique, but it is not mentioned in the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) at this stage.
