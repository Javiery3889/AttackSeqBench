 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only occur after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Tactic: Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) and Tactic: Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution). This suggests that the initial access is gained through a spear phishing email with an attachment, and then the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2017-8750) is used to execute code on the victim's machine.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence where the victim is first infected with QuasarRAT and then receives spear phishing emails. However, the related TTPs indicate that the spear phishing email is the initial access vector, not a subsequent action after infection. Therefore, it is more plausible that the spear phishing email with the RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery occurs before the victim is infected with QuasarRAT.

4. Conclusion: The final answer is "No". The spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery do not occur only after getting infected with QuasarRAT. Instead, they are likely the initial access vector in the attack sequence.
