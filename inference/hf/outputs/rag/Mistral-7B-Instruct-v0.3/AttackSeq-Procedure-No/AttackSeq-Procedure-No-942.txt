 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SLUB malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase, given that it has already collected system information and captured screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server under the Discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration) and using C2 channels (Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for data transfer.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the Discovery phase, where the malware collects system information and captures screenshots. This collected data is likely to be valuable to the attacker, and it is common for malware to exfiltrate this data as part of the Exfiltration phase. The related TTPs support this, as they focus on Exfiltration and using C2 channels for data transfer. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SLUB malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Exfiltration and using C2 channels for data transfer.
   - Given that the malware has already collected valuable data during the Discovery phase, it is likely that this data will be exfiltrated as part of the Exfiltration phase.
   - Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
