 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor malware, after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office and dropping itself, will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves exploitation (T1203), virtualization/sandbox evasion (T1497) as a defense evasion technique, and potentially other techniques related to these tactics.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial exploitation and dropping of the Taidoor malware. The related TTPs suggest that Taidoor is known to perform virtualization/sandbox evasion as a defense evasion technique. Therefore, it is plausible that Taidoor would perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers to ensure it is operating in a non-sandboxed environment.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Taidoor will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Taidoor is known to perform virtualization/sandbox evasion as a defense evasion technique.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Taidoor would perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers to ensure it is operating in a non-sandboxed environment.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
