 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence after initial access is gained through obfuscated backdoor payload.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and obfuscation methods (T1027.010) for defense evasion, as well as the potential use of deobfuscation/decoding files or information (T1140).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the related TTPs. First, the attackers use obfuscation (T1027.010) to hide their backdoor payload. Then, they gain initial access by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing these scripts through macro-triggered events (T1059.001). After gaining initial access, it is likely that they will deobfuscate/decode the scripts to drop components for persistence, such as invoker.ps1 (T1140).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence after initial access is gained through obfuscated backdoor payload.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and obfuscation methods (T1027.010) for defense evasion, as well as the potential use of deobfuscation/decoding files or information (T1140).
   - Based on this information, it is likely that the attackers will first gain initial access by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing these scripts through macro-triggered events (T1059.001). After gaining initial access, they will deobfuscate/decode the scripts to drop components for persistence, such as invoker.ps1 (T1140).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
