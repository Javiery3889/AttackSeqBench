 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about Gamaredon's actions after using backdoors to list interesting files, specifically Office documents. The question then inquires whether Gamaredon automatically uploads the harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1025-Data from Removable Media and T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive, both under the Tactic: Collection. These TTPs suggest that Gamaredon is interested in collecting data from removable media and network shared drives. However, there is no mention of automatic uploading of harvested data to the C&C server before scanning all drives.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". Given that the question asks about automatic uploading of harvested data to the C&C server, and there is no indication in the question or related TTPs that this is a common practice for Gamaredon, the most plausible answer would be "No".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about Gamaredon's actions after harvesting Office documents. The related TTPs suggest that Gamaredon is interested in collecting data from removable media and network shared drives.
   - There is no indication in the question or related TTPs that Gamaredon automatically uploads harvested data to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No". Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives for sensitive data before automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.
