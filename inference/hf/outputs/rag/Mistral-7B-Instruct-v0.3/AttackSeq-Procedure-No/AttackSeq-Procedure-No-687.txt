 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will employ Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for Initial Access after using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 for Reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Discovery, specifically Remote System Discovery (T1018) and Network Service Discovery (T1046). These TTPs are related to the Reconnaissance phase, not the Initial Access phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs from Reconnaissance to Initial Access. However, the related TTPs indicate that the attacker is only in the Reconnaissance phase. The tools mentioned in the question for Initial Access (Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC) are not typically used for Reconnaissance. Therefore, it is not likely that the attacker will employ these tools for Initial Access after using tools for Reconnaissance as suggested in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests a sequence of TTPs from Reconnaissance to Initial Access.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is only in the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The tools for Initial Access (Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC) are not typically used for Reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the attacker will employ these tools for Initial Access after using tools for Reconnaissance as suggested in the question.
   - Final Answer: No.
