 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using techniques for Defense Evasion (T1140) and Exfiltration (T1041, T1048.003). However, there is no mention of FTP in the related TTPs, which suggests that FTP is not a likely method for either downloading or exfiltrating data in this scenario.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question presents two answer choices, A: Yes and B: No. Given the absence of FTP in the related TTPs, it is less likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
