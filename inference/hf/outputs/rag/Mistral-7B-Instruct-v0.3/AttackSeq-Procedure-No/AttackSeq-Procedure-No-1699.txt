 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will conceal execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading before establishing persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Defense Evasion (T1620) with Reflective Code Loading and Persistence (T1546.015) with Component Object Model Hijacking.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after abusing PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager. The related TTPs suggest that the adversaries may first use Reflective Code Loading (T1620) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads, and then establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects (T1546.015). This sequence aligns with the question, as it describes a sequence of TTPs that could follow the execution of the Empire stager.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading (conceal execution of malicious payloads)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking (establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects)
