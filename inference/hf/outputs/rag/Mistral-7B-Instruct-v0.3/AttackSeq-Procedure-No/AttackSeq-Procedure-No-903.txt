 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the CARBANAK RAT beaconed to the Command-and-Control server and the PowerShell RAT communicated with the domain hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate only after the attacker performed reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are related to data exfiltration (T1029 and T1041) but do not mention Cobalt Strike or any reconnaissance or data discovery techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after data exfiltration, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about Cobalt Strike or any other reconnaissance or data discovery techniques. Therefore, it is not likely that the CARBANAK RAT beaconed to the Command-and-Control server and the PowerShell RAT communicated with the domain hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate only after the attacker performed reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery before the CARBANAK RAT beaconing and PowerShell RAT communication. Therefore, the answer is "No".
