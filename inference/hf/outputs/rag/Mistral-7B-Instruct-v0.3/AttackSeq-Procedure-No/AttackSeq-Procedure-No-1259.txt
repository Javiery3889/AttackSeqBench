 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if BlueBravo is likely to establish persistence by creating registry run keys to execute malware during system startup, given that they have already gathered victim system information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence and Technique T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) are relevant to the question. This technique is used to ensure the malware persists on the compromised system by running it during system startup.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the creation of registry run keys for persistence, which is exactly what Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) describes. Since BlueBravo has already gathered system information, it is plausible that they would use this technique to maintain their access to the system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that BlueBravo would establish persistence by creating registry run keys to execute malware during system startup.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
