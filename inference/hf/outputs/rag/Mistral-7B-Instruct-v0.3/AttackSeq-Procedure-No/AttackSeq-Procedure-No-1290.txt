 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Mustang Panda, after using the double extension trick in a spearphishing campaign, is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension. The T1090-Proxy technique involves using a proxy to communicate with the command and control server, while T1036.007 is a method of evading defenses by using double file extensions.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The double extension trick (T1036.007) is a method used for defense evasion, not for communication. On the other hand, the reverse SOCKS proxy (T1090) is a technique used for command and control communication. Since the question asks about communication strategy, it is more likely that Mustang Panda would use a reverse SOCKS proxy if they were to employ a communication strategy after the double extension trick, but there is no guarantee that they will do so. However, the double extension trick does not inherently imply the use of a reverse SOCKS proxy. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No, Mustang Panda is not likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy after utilizing the double extension trick.
