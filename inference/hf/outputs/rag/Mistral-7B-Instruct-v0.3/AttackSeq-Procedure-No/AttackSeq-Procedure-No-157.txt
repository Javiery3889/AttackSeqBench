 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement between MSPs and other victims before conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network, after initially sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing, Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing, and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. These TTPs suggest that the attacker initially gains access to a system (Initial Access) through a spear phishing attack (T1566 or T1566.001), and then moves laterally within the network (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about APT10's use of shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement. The TTPs provided suggest that APT10 uses spear phishing to gain initial access and then moves laterally within the network. MSPs (Managed Service Providers) are often used by multiple organizations, making them a potential target for lateral movement between those organizations. Therefore, it is plausible that APT10 would leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement, as this would allow them to access multiple victims more efficiently.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement after initially sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access.
   - The related TTPs suggest that APT10 initially gains access through a spear phishing attack and then moves laterally within the network.
