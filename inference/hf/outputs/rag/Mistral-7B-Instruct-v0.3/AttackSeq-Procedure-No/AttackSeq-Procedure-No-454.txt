 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT-TOCS, after exhibiting lateral movement through network projection within the internal network, is likely to communicate using removable media for command and control operations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media and Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media. This suggests that APT-TOCS may use removable media for replication (lateral movement) but does not necessarily imply that it will use removable media for command and control operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about command and control operations, not replication or lateral movement. The TTPs provided do not directly support the use of removable media for command and control operations after lateral movement. Therefore, it is less likely that APT-TOCS will communicate using removable media for command and control operations.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about command and control operations after lateral movement.
   - The related TTPs suggest that APT-TOCS may use removable media for replication but do not directly support the use of removable media for command and control operations.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that APT-TOCS will communicate using removable media for command and control operations.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
