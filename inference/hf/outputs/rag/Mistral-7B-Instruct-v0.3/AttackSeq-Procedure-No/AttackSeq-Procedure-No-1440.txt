 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the StellarParticle campaign will generate repeated MFA requests to access victim accounts before using web session cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has used credential hopping and configured malware for WMI persistence (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1550.002). They have also used web session cookies for lateral movement (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.004). However, there is no mention of MFA request generation in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about MFA requests and web session cookies, but the related TTPs do not suggest that MFA requests will be generated before using web session cookies. The sequence of TTPs seems to be: Credential Access (credential hopping and malware configuration) -> Defense Evasion (using web session cookies for lateral movement).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the StellarParticle campaign will generate repeated MFA requests to access victim accounts before using web session cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources. The answer is "No".
