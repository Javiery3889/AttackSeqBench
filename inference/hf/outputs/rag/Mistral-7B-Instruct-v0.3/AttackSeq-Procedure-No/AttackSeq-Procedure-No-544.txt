 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the C&C servers delivering a payload capable of capturing credentials related to cryptocurrency wallets as part of the impact phase.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack sequence involves exfiltration (T1041) and the impact tactic (T1657), which is related to financial theft.
3. Given that the attack sequence includes exfiltration of data and the impact tactic, it is plausible that the attackers would be interested in stealing sensitive data such as cryptocurrency wallet credentials.
4. The C&C servers, after receiving the stolen data, could deliver a payload designed to capture such credentials as part of the impact phase, which aligns with the T1657 technique.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the C&C servers delivered a payload capable of capturing credentials related to cryptocurrency wallets as part of the impact phase.
