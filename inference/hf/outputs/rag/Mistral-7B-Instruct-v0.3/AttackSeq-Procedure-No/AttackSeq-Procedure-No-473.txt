 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Infamous Chisel, after leveraging Command and Control capabilities, is likely to perform discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the target environment. The specific techniques mentioned are T1018 (Remote System Discovery), T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery), and T1046 (Network Service Discovery).

3. Compare and Evaluate: Infamous Chisel is a versatile tool that provides various Command and Control capabilities, including SCP, Socks, and SSH. After establishing a foothold in the target system, it is plausible for the attacker to use the tool to discover more about the target environment. The netd component of Infamous Chisel is designed for network discovery, which aligns with the techniques T1018, T1049, and T1046.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel, after leveraging Command and Control capabilities, is likely to perform discovery activities.
