 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Regin, after performing certain TTPs during the discovery phase, is likely to set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Discovery (T1040-Network Sniffing) and Tactic: Collection (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule). However, T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule is a technique under the Collection tactic, not Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Regin is known for its extensive Discovery and Reconnaissance activities, such as network sniffing (T1040), but it does not primarily focus on email traffic manipulation or forwarding rules. The TTPs provided in the question (gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files) are more related to Discovery and Reconnaissance, not Email Forwarding Rule.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided question and related TTPs, it is less likely that Regin would set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts after performing the mentioned TTPs during the discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
