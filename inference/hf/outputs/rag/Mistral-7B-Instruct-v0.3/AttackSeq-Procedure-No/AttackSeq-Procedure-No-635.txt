 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques before inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is a drive-by compromise (T1189) and the exploit is related to JavaScript (T1059.007). Heap spraying (T1192) is a technique used to create a controlled heap environment to facilitate reliable exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Heap spraying is typically used as a pre-exploitation technique to prepare the memory for a successful exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability. However, in this case, the question mentions that the exploit landing page is related to CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome. This vulnerability is a use-after-free vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine, which does not require heap spraying for successful exploitation.

4. Conclusion: Since the exploit in this case is related to a JavaScript use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome, it is not likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques before inserting the malicious JavaScript code into the Korean-language news portal. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
