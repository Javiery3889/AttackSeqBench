 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus Group, after using system utilities for reconnaissance and gaining initial access through malicious documents, leveraged compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement across the network and then used net user and SMBMap for network share discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Initial Access (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) and the Tactic of Lateral Movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares). However, it does not mention the use of net user or SMBMap in the initial access or lateral movement phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not align with this sequence. The initial access and lateral movement TTPs do not include the use of net user or SMBMap. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Lazarus Group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement and then used net user and SMBMap for network share discovery.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". The Lazarus Group did not likely use compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement across the network and then use net user and SMBMap for network share discovery.
