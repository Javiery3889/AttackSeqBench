 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2) after modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL and loading it into its own svchost.exe process.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the system is using Defense Evasion (T1036.005) and Command and Control (T1102.002, T1071.005) techniques. However, there is no mention of the Jabber/XMPP protocol in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of the Jabber/XMPP protocol, but the related TTPs do not provide any evidence to suggest that this protocol is being used. The Defense Evasion technique (T1036.005) is used to avoid detection, and the Command and Control techniques (T1102.002, T1071.005) are used for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. However, the question does not provide any information about the specific C2 protocol being used.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2. The related TTPs do not provide any evidence to suggest that this is the case. Therefore, it is not likely that the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2. Final Answer: B: No.
