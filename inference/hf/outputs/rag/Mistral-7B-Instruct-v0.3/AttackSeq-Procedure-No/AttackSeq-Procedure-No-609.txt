 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra (a threat group) would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase after distributing the malware during the resource development phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Hidden Cobra used T1583.001 (Registered Domain) and T1584.001 (Spearphishing Link) techniques during the resource development phase to distribute the Bankshot implant. These TTPs are often used to establish a foothold in the target environment and set up command and control (C2) channels.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the reconnaissance phase, which is a common follow-up phase after establishing a foothold in the target environment. The Bankshot malware implant, once deployed, can be used to collect information on victim organizations, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase. Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Hidden Cobra used the Bankshot malware implant during the resource development phase.
   - After establishing a foothold in the target environment, it is common for threat groups to move to the reconnaissance phase to gather information on victim organizations.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
