 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Higaisa APT group is likely to execute multiple commands leveraging 'gosia.exe' after distributing malicious LNK files for initial access, given that they have already maintained persistence by copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has used techniques for persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task, T1547.009-Shortcut Modification) and execution (T1053.005-Scheduled Task). However, there is no mention of the use of 'gosia.exe' or the distribution of malicious LNK files for initial access in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the attacker first establishes persistence, then distributes malicious LNK files, and finally executes multiple commands using 'gosia.exe'. However, the related TTPs only show the first two steps (persistence and execution) but do not indicate the use of 'gosia.exe' or the distribution of LNK files. Therefore, it is not plausible that the attacker would execute multiple commands using 'gosia.exe' after distributing malicious LNK files based on the given information.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the Higaisa APT group did not execute multiple commands leveraging 'gosia.exe' to bypass detection only after distributing malicious LNK files disguised as Curriculum Vitae and IELTS exam results for initial access. The answer is "No".
