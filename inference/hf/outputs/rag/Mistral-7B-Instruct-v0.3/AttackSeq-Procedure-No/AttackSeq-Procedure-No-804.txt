 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FIN4 uses a proxy server between victims and the C2 server during their command and control phase instead of relying on Tor for anonymous communication.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of proxy servers (T1090-Proxy, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy) and symmetric cryptography (T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography) in the command and control phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of a proxy server during the command and control phase. The related TTPs confirm the use of proxy servers in the command and control phase (T1090-Proxy, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy). While Tor is mentioned in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is not explicitly related to the use of a proxy server in this context. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the use of a proxy server during the command and control phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if FIN4 uses a proxy server during the command and control phase instead of Tor.
   - The related TTPs mention the use of proxy servers (T1090-Proxy, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy) in the command and control phase.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN4 uses a proxy server during their command and control phase instead of relying on Tor for anonymous communication.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
