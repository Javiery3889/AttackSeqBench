 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe and using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that Tropic Trooper is known to use DLL injection (T1055.001) for both privilege escalation (T1055.001) and defense evasion (T1055.001), and also for persistence through DLL side-loading (T1574.002). The FakeRun loader is a technique used for process injection and process hollowing, which are methods of defense evasion and process creation (T1055.003).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of Equation Editor exploits, which is a technique often used for code execution (T1056). This aligns with the TTP of Defense Evasion (T1055), as the attacker is trying to evade detection by using a legitimate tool for malicious purposes. The injected malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe also aligns with the TTP of Privilege Escalation (T1055). After successfully executing the installer package with malicious payloads, it would be logical for the attacker to use the FakeRun loader for process injection (T1055.003) to launch dllhost.exe, as this would further help in evading detection.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
