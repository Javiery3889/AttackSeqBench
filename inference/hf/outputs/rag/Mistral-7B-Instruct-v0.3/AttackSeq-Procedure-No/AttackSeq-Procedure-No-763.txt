 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets after deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery, which is about gathering information about the target's browser and system. This TTP is related to the initial reconnaissance phase, not the defense evasion phase. The TTP T1598.003-Spearphishing Link is also a reconnaissance technique, which is used to initiate the attack, not to collect detailed information after the phishing attack. The TTP T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location is a defense evasion technique, but it does not involve collecting detailed information about the target.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about collecting detailed information about targets, such as geographic location and working times. The related TTPs do not suggest that this information is collected after the phishing attack and defense evasion techniques. Instead, the TTPs suggest that the initial reconnaissance is performed before the phishing attack. Therefore, it is more likely that Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets before deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets after deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the initial reconnaissance is performed before the phishing attack, not after.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that Charming Kitten collected detailed information about their targets before deploying phishing attacks and crafting fake security alerts.
   - Final Answer: No.
