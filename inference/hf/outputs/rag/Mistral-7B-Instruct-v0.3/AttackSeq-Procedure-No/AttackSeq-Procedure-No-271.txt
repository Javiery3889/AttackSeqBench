 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Mustang Panda's Korplug variant to perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Collection and the Technique of T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method, which indicates the use of a custom method for data archiving, but does not suggest data discovery. The Discovery Tactic (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) is not mentioned in the question or related TTPs, which implies it is not a likely follow-up action after the data exfiltration technique.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about data discovery, but the related TTPs do not suggest this action. Therefore, it is more plausible that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant would not perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Mustang Panda's Korplug variant is likely to perform data discovery after data exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs mention the use of a custom method for data archiving (T1560.003), but do not suggest data discovery.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant would not perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
