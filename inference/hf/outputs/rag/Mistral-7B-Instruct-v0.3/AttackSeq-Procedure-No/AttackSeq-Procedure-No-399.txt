 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if GHOLE malware will communicate with its C&C servers and the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers only before creating a mutex called 'woolger'.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using defense evasion mechanisms (T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion) and keylogging (T1056.001-Keylogging) for collection of credentials. However, there is no indication that the keylogger will only upload logs after creating a mutex.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a specific sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The creation of a mutex for defense evasion could happen at any point during the attack, not necessarily before the keylogger uploads data. Therefore, it is not likely that the keylogger will upload logs only after creating a mutex.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests a specific sequence of events that is not supported by the related TTPs.
   - The creation of a mutex for defense evasion could happen at any point during the attack, not necessarily before the keylogger uploads data.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the keylogger will upload logs only after creating a mutex.
   - Final Answer: No.
