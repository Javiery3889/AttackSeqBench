 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance after communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Rising Sun implant may be involved in Discovery and Exfiltration tactics. Specifically, the TTPs T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery suggest that the implant could be gathering network and system information as part of the Discovery tactic. The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel indicates that the implant may exfiltrate data, but it does not necessarily imply that it performs initial reconnaissance.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs related to Discovery (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery) suggest that the Rising Sun implant could be gathering network and system information, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase of an attack. The TTP T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel does not directly support the initial reconnaissance phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information (Answer A). This aligns with the Discovery tactics (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery) mentioned in the related TTPs.
