 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a group will deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the group has already performed Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002) as part of the Reconnaissance phase. However, the Discovery technique T1046 - Network Service Discovery is not directly related to deploying public exploits.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about deploying public exploits, which is not directly related to the Discovery technique T1046 - Network Service Discovery. Instead, it seems more likely that the group would use Exploitation (T1059) or Post-Exploitation (T1068) techniques to exploit the vulnerabilities they have already discovered through Vulnerability Scanning (T1595.002).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the group will deploy public exploits after conducting vulnerability scanning.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the group has already performed Vulnerability Scanning.
   - However, the question does not suggest that the group will perform additional Vulnerability Scanning before deploying exploits.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the group will deploy public exploits only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
