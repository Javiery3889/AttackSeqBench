 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will deploy a network sniffer module after discovering running processes and browser data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include T1040-Network Sniffing, which is a technique used to intercept and analyze network traffic. T1217-Browser Information Discovery is also related, as it involves gathering data from web browsers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is one where the malware first discovers running processes and browser data (T1040 and T1217), and then deploys a network sniffer module to intercept network traffic, potentially including user credentials being sent over the network (T1040). This sequence would allow the malware to target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores more effectively.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The malware, having discovered running processes and browser data, is likely to deploy a network sniffer module to intercept network traffic, including user credentials being sent over the network. This would allow the malware to target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores more effectively. Final Answer: Yes.
