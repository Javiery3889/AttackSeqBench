 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server, the campaign would only then execute PowerShell scripts triggered by the macro in the Word document and employ obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of PowerShell (T1059.001) and Visual Basic (T1059.005) for execution, but they do not specify a sequence or connection between these techniques and the PRB-Backdoor communication with the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The PRB-Backdoor communication with the C&C server does not necessarily imply the execution of PowerShell scripts or the use of obfuscated macro scripts. Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the question and the provided TTPs is "No".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests a specific sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence.
   - The PRB-Backdoor communication with the C&C server does not necessarily imply the execution of PowerShell scripts or the use of obfuscated macro scripts.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server, the campaign would only then execute PowerShell scripts triggered by the macro in the Word document and employ obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
