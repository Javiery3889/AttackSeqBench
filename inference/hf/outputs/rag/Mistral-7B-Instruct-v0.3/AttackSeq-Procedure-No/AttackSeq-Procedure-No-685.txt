 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will establish contact with C2 servers after exfiltrating AWS credentials.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have already used T1020 - Automated Exfiltration to exfiltrate AWS credentials. This technique often involves the use of C2 servers for communication and command execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about establishing contact with C2 servers, and the related TTPs suggest that this is a common practice after exfiltration. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that the attackers will likely use C2 servers for further communication and command execution, which may include downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if attackers will establish contact with C2 servers after exfiltrating AWS credentials.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have used T1020 - Automated Exfiltration, which often involves C2 servers for communication and command execution.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will establish contact with C2 servers, and this may include downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
