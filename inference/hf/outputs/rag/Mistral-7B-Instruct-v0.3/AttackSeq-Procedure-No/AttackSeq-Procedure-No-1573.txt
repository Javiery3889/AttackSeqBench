 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will scan for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan before targeting user credentials through tools like procdump and Mimikatz after exploiting remote services for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Tactic: Lateral Movement (T1210) and Technique: Exploitation of Remote Services. This suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the network and is moving laterally. However, the Tactic: Credential Access (T1003) is not directly related to the initial lateral movement but rather to the acquisition of user credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events: scanning, exploitation, lateral movement, and credential access. The related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they do not indicate a step for scanning the network before credential access. Instead, the TTPs suggest that the attacker has already gained access and is moving laterally, and then may attempt to access credentials. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker would target user credentials (T1003) after exploiting remote services for lateral movement (T1210), without a necessary step of scanning the network first.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Earth Lusca will target user credentials through tools like procdump and Mimikatz after exploiting remote services for lateral movement, without scanning for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan first. Therefore, the answer is "No".
