 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Hidden Cobra, after targeting cryptocurrency and financial organizations to gather victim identity information, is likely to use phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites before using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits for initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that Hidden Cobra has used Spearphishing Voice (T1566.004) for initial access, and they have also used Impersonation (T1656) for defense evasion. Additionally, they have been involved in Reconnaissance activities, including Spearphishing Voice (T1598.004). However, there is no mention of using phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites or using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs provided in the question (phone calls, credential-harvesting websites, spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits) does not align with the TTPs used by Hidden Cobra as per the related TTPs. The sequence seems to be more related to a different attacker's TTPs.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided question and related TTPs, it is not likely that Hidden Cobra will use phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites before using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits for initial access.
