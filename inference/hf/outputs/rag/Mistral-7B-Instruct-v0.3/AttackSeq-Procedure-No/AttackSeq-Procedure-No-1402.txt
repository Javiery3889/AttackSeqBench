 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13, known for using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that FIN13 has been known to use techniques for Lateral Movement (T1570) and Software Deployment Tools (T1072). However, there is no indication that they have used these tools in the sequence suggested in the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs that does not align with the known behavior of FIN13. The sequence proposed (Discovery -> Software Deployment Tools -> Lateral Movement -> Data Collection -> Fraudulent Transactions) is not a common or plausible sequence for FIN13. A more likely sequence would be Discovery -> Lateral Movement (using native OS binaries or custom malware) -> Data Collection -> Fraudulent Transactions. The use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement is not a typical behavior for FIN13, as they are more likely to use their custom malware for this purpose.

Therefore, the answer is B: No, it is not likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.
