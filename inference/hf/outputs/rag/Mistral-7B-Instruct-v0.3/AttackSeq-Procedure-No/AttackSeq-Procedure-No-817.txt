 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves the use of non-standard ports (T1571-Non-Standard Port) and Command and Control (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs suggest that the attacker might first establish communication with the C2 server using non-standard ports (T1571) as part of the Command and Control (T1095) phase. After establishing this connection, the attacker could then proceed to steal information and encrypt it (which is not explicitly mentioned in the question but is a common action in the context of WinDealer malware).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
