 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks after using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stealing a VPN certificate.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT15 has used the technique T1078-Valid Accounts in the tactics of Defense Evasion, Persistence, and Initial Access. This technique involves an attacker using valid accounts to bypass or evade security measures.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". Given that the related TTPs indicate the use of valid accounts, it is more likely that APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks, such as VPN credentials, instead of deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
