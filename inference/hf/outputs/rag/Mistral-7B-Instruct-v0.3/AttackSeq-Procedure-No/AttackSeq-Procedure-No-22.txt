 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Mustang Panda is known to use phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports to gain initial access. The question asks if it is likely that they will use SSH tunneling during command and control before employing stagers to download additional shellcode for execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include T1572-Protocol Tunneling (Command and Control) and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (Command and Control). T1204.001-Malicious Link (Execution) is also provided, but it does not directly relate to the question as it is about delivering the initial payload (phishing lure) rather than the subsequent command and control or execution stages.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP T1572-Protocol Tunneling (SSH tunneling) is mentioned in the related TTPs, which suggests that it is a technique that Mustang Panda might use for command and control. Once they have gained initial access, it is a common practice for advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Mustang Panda to establish a secure and covert communication channel for further operations. This would involve SSH tunneling.

After establishing command and control, it is also likely that they will download additional shellcode for execution, which aligns with the TTP T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

- T1204.001-Malicious Link (Deliver the initial payload)
- T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (Download additional shellcode for execution)
- T1572-Protocol Tunneling (SSH tunneling for command and control)

However, it's important to note that the sequence might vary depending on the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Mustang Panda in a given attack. This analysis is based on general observations and trends in their known TTPs.
