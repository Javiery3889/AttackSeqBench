 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory, after TG1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer were used for Lateral Movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that TG1021 used SMB and Windows Admin Shares for Lateral Movement, and T1570 for Lateral Tool Transfer. There is no mention of Discovery techniques like T1083-File and Directory Discovery or tools like SharpHound or PowerSploit.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Discovery phase activities, but the related TTPs only mention Lateral Movement techniques. Since there is no evidence of Discovery techniques in the related TTPs, it is unlikely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if TG1021 performed Discovery phase activities after Lateral Movement.
   - The related TTPs only mention Lateral Movement techniques, not Discovery techniques.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
