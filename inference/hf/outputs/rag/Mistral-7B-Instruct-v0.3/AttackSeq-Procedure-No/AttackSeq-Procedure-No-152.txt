 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for Discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has performed Discovery and Lateral Movement, but there is no mention of SAML tokens or AD FS servers in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific technique (T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material) related to Lateral Movement, but the given answer choices do not include this technique. The question also mentions SAML tokens and AD FS servers, but these are not mentioned in the related TTPs. The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the question and related TTPs would not involve abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.
   - The related TTPs do not mention SAML tokens or AD FS servers, and the question does not provide any evidence that TG1021 has compromised an AD FS server.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.
   - Final Answer: No.
