 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Longhorn's malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control and Scheduled Transfer (T1029) for Exfiltration. However, there is no mention of using a custom cryptographic protocol or configuring specific domain and IP address combinations per target.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific and customized configuration for C&C communication, which is not mentioned in the related TTPs. The TTPs suggest that the malware uses common web protocols for communication and exfiltration, but they do not indicate the use of a custom cryptographic protocol or specific domain and IP address configuration per target.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Longhorn's malware does not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This is because the question asks for a specific and customized configuration, which is not suggested by the provided TTPs. Instead, the TTPs indicate that the malware uses common web protocols for communication and exfiltration. Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
