 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attack group would exploit an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability after securing alternative means of persistence and attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack group has already established persistence on victim systems using Domain Accounts (T1078.002) and Valid Accounts (T1078). These TTPs suggest that the attack group has already gained access to the victim network. The Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials, however, suggests that the attack group is gathering user credentials, which is typically done during the initial stages of an attack, before establishing persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question (gaining alternative means of persistence, exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, and gathering user credentials) does not align with the sequence suggested by the related TTPs (establishing persistence, gathering user credentials, and then potentially exploiting a vulnerability).

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that the attack group would first gather user credentials and then establish persistence, rather than exploiting a vulnerability after securing alternative means of persistence. Therefore, the answer is "No".
