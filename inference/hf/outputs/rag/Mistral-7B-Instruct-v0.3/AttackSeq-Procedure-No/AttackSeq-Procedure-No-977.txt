 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document (T1204.002-Malicious File), and persistence was established via a scheduled task (T1053.005-Scheduled Task). However, there is no mention of the malicious Word document being delivered through LinkedIn messages.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of events, and the related TTPs provide two separate events: initial access and persistence. The question does not mention LinkedIn messages as a delivery mechanism for the malicious Word document, which is the first event in the sequence. Therefore, it is not likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the delivery of the malicious Word document through LinkedIn messages. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
