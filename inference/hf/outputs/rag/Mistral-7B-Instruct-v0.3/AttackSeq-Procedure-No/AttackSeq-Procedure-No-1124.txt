 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image, given a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution) to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack, which is a technique used to bypass security controls by downgrading the security protocol to an older, less secure version. However, it does not directly relate to the exploitation of Adobe Flash or the spear-phishing attack.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial access is gained through the spear-phishing attack. The TTPs provided do not suggest that downgrading NTLM would occur before the shellcode installs the payload. Instead, the downgrade attack (T1562.010) is typically used to bypass security controls at a later stage in the attack, not during the initial access or payload installation phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the provided TTPs, it is more likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will install the payload embedded in the GIF image before attempting to downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
