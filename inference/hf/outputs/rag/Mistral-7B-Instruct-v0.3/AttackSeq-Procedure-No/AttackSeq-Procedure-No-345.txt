 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists after using HTTPS communication for command and control operations.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Discovery tactics, specifically T1082-System Information Discovery and T1057-Process Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command, which is a common method for system information and process discovery (T1082 and T1057). Since the malware is already using HTTPS communication, a method often used for command and control, it is plausible that it could also use this command to discover system information and process lists.

Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes". The malware is likely to discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.
