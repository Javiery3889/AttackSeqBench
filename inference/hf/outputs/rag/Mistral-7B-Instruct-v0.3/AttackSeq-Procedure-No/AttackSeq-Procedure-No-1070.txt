 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection. This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. However, it does not directly involve the use of RegAsm.exe or manipulating dllhost.exe.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions Tropic Trooper, but the related TTPs do not suggest a sequence of events that includes RegAsm.exe or manipulating dllhost.exe after the initial Equation Editor exploit and installer package execution. The TTPs related to Tropic Trooper might include techniques like T1086 (PowerShell) or T1055.003 (Process Injection), but not the specific sequence mentioned in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Tropic Trooper would not drop RegAsm.exe and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
