 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the data collected by Yellow Garuda are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the tactics of Exfiltration and the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which involves transferring data to a command and control (C2) server. Additionally, T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is also mentioned, which suggests an attempt to evade detection by limiting the size of data transfers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. The related TTP T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits suggests an attempt to evade detection by limiting the size of data transfers, which aligns with the idea of dividing data into fixed-size chunks. Therefore, it is more likely that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Yellow Garuda divides the collected data into fixed-size chunks (T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits) and then exfiltrates these chunks over a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
