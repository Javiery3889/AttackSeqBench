 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails before using a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using tactics for Initial Access and specifically the technique T1566-Phishing, which involves sending spear phishing emails. This suggests that the attackers are likely to use email-based attacks to gain initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. If the attackers use spear phishing emails (T1566-Phishing) to gain initial access, it is plausible that they would use OLE2 format documents containing embedded links as a means to deliver their malicious payload. After gaining initial access, they could then use Microsoft Word to send a GET request to gather information about the installed software during reconnaissance (which is not explicitly mentioned in the question or related TTPs but is a common technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (Spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1086-PowerShell (Assuming the OLE2 document uses PowerShell to execute the malicious payload)
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1086.001-Scripting (Microsoft Word sending a GET request to gather information about the installed software)
