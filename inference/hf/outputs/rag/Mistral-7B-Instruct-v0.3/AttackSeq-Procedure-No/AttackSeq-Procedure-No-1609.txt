 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials), Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration), and Credential Access (T1552.001-Credentials In Files). However, there is no mention of njRAT or GoLang-based file recon plugins in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of njRAT and GoLang-based file recon plugins, but these are not among the related TTPs. The sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with the related TTPs provided. Therefore, it is not likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs do not include njRAT or GoLang-based file recon plugins, and the sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with the related TTPs provided.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees during Credential Access using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration. Final Answer: No.
