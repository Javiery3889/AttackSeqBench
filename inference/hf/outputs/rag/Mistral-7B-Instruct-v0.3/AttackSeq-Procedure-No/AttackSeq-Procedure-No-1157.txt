 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. The question specifically mentions locking out the original owners by changing account passwords and using phishing sites to collect credentials.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion (T1656) and Resource Development (T1586), with a focus on compromising accounts and email accounts.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not mention password changes as the first step in the sequence. Instead, it mentions the use of phishing sites to collect credentials. The TTPs related to Defense Evasion (T1656) and Resource Development (T1586) do not necessarily imply password changes as the initial step. However, they do suggest that the attackers are trying to gain access to accounts (T1586) and potentially evade detection (T1656).

4. Conclusion: Given the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the attackers would first use phishing sites to collect credentials (T1586.001 - Phishing: Attachments) and then use those credentials to compromise accounts (T1586). Only after gaining access to the accounts would they potentially lock out the original owners by changing passwords (T1586.003 - Account Takeover). Therefore, the answer is B: No. The attackers are not likely to lock out the original owners by changing passwords only before using phishing sites to collect credentials.
