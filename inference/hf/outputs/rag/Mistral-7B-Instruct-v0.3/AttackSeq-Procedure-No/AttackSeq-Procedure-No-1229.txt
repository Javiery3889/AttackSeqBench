 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of Hermes ransomware, which is a known tool used by the Lazarus group for data encryption.
2. The Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact, is related to the question as it describes the act of encrypting data for the purpose of causing harm or disrupting operations.
3. After encrypting the data, the Lazarus group left ransom notes in encrypted directories, which is a common tactic used by ransomware groups to demand ransom.
4. The Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, is related to the question as it describes the use of symmetric cryptography for command and control communication.
5. The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.
6. Backdoor malware is often used for maintaining persistence and establishing command and control communication in a network.
7. Given that the Lazarus group is known for using multiple stages of malware in their attacks, it is plausible that they would use backdoor malware for command and control communication after deploying the ransomware.
8. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact (deploying Hermes ransomware), T1486.007-Ransomware Note or Instruction (leaving ransom notes), and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography (establishing command and control communication using backdoor malware).
9. Since the question asks if it is likely that they established command and control communication, the answer is "Yes".
