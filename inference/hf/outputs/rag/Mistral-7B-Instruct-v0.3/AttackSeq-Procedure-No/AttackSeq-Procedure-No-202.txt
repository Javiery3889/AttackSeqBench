 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use spearphishing to initially compromise victims after using spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing (T1566).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access was achieved through spearphishing. The attackers have already used spearphishing to execute GreyEnergy mini, which suggests they have initial access. It is plausible that they would use the same method (spearphishing) to compromise additional victims, as this is a common tactic in a multi-stage attack. After initial access, they may proceed to map the network and collect passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz, which are tactics associated with later stages of the attack.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers will use spearphishing to initially compromise victims before mapping the network and collecting passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
