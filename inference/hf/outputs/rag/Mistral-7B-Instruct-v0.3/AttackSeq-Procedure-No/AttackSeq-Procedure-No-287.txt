 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Elfin, after deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill, is likely to exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails only after scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are Execution (T1203) and Initial Access (T1566.002), which correspond to the deployment of malware and spear-phishing, respectively. However, there is no mention of scanning for vulnerable websites or creating C&C infrastructure in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where Elfin first scans for vulnerable websites, then exploits CVE-2018-20250, and finally delivers the exploit via spear-phishing emails. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they only indicate the deployment of malware and spear-phishing, not scanning for vulnerable websites or creating C&C infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if Elfin, after deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill, is likely to exploit CVE-2018-20250 by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails only after scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure. Based on the related TTPs, it is not likely that this sequence of events would occur, as the TTPs only indicate the deployment of malware and spear-phishing, not scanning for vulnerable websites or creating C&C infrastructure. Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
