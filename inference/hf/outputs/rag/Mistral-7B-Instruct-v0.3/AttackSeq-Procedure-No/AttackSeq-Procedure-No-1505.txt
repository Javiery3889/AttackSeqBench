 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that proxy servers will be used within the RIG EK's infrastructure after it establishes an encrypted channel using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of proxy servers (T1090-Proxy) and the use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of proxy servers is a technique often employed to make infections harder to detect by routing traffic through multiple servers, making it more difficult to trace back to the original source. The use of symmetric cryptography, as mentioned in the question, is a method used to encrypt communication between the attacker and the compromised system. By using a custom version of RC4, RIG EK is already taking steps to secure its communication channel. Using proxy servers would further enhance the security of its infrastructure by adding an additional layer of obfuscation.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs and the question, it is more likely that RIG EK will use proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
