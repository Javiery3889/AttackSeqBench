 Final Answer: Yes (A)

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the malware uses HTTPS for C2 communication, Microsoft OneDrive, and potentially DropBox for bidirectional communication.
2. The related TTPs mention the Discovery tactic, specifically System Information Discovery (T1082). This tactic involves gathering information about the victim system, which includes details like username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes.
3. The Command and Control tactic (T1102) is also mentioned, but the specific technique T1102.002 refers to bidirectional communication, which is already part of the question.
4. Given that the malware has established communication channels with the C2 server via HTTPS, OneDrive, and potentially DropBox, it is likely that the malware will use these channels to send the gathered system information back to the attacker. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will gather system information only afterward.
5. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the context provided by the related TTPs.
