 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Longhorn's tools are likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents only after gaining initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution) and Tactic: Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery). These TTPs do not necessarily imply that the attacker will follow guidelines to avoid detection before gaining initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after system fingerprinting for discovery. The TTPs provided do not suggest that Longhorn will follow guidelines to avoid detection before gaining initial access. The Tactic: Execution (T1203) is related to the exploitation of a vulnerability, which is the initial access phase, not the post-exploitation phase where avoidance of detection guidelines would be applied.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events after system fingerprinting for discovery.
   - The related TTPs provided do not suggest that Longhorn will follow guidelines to avoid detection before gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents only before gaining initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
