 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only after deploying Hermes ransomware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion) to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, and Tactic: Impact (T1490-Inhibit System Recovery) to disrupt the bank's operations. However, there is no mention of backdoor malware or communication with command-and-control servers in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific sequence of events involving backdoor malware and communication with command-and-control servers. The related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they only describe the deployment of the ransomware and the disruption of system recovery. Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the attack sequence in the question is "No".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only after deploying Hermes ransomware.
   - The related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they only describe the deployment of the ransomware and the disruption of system recovery.
