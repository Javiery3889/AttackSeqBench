 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the use of obfuscation techniques after the final JavaScript downloader has dropped a file and executed it in the system's temporary directory.
2. The related TTPs provided include T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion, and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, also a Defense Evasion technique.
3. The sequence of TTPs in this scenario would likely be as follows:
   - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript (The JavaScript payload is executed after the user opens the malicious Word document.)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (The attacker uses obfuscation techniques on the JavaScript payload to make it harder to analyze.)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (The attacker deobfuscates the JavaScript payload after it has been executed and the final downloader has dropped a file.)
4. Therefore, it is likely that the attacker used obfuscation techniques only after the final JavaScript downloader dropped a file and executed it in the system's temporary directory.
