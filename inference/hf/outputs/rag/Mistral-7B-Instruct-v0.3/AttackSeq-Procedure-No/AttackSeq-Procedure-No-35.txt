 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect files and then target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores after discovery activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is performing Collection (T1005) of data from local systems and Discovery (T1217) of browser information. This suggests that the malware is gathering information about the system and the user's browsing activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is one where the malware first collects data from local systems (T1005) and then moves on to targeting and exfiltrating credentials (T1087, not listed in the answer choices but implied by the question). Since the question also mentions the collection of files (implied by the mention of copying them from local systems and removable media), it is likely that the malware will collect files before targeting credentials. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1005: Data from Local System (Collection)
   - T1087: Credential Access (Exfiltration)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the malware will collect files and then exfiltrate credentials.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is gathering information about the system and the user's browsing activities (T1005, T1217).
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the malware will first collect data from local systems (T1005) and then move on to targeting and exfiltrating credentials (T1087).
   - Therefore, the final answer is: A: Yes.
