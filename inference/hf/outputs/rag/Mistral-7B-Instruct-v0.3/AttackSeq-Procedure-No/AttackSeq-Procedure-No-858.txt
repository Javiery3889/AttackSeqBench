 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Explosive Trojan will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker may use techniques for Lateral Movement, such as exploitation of Remote Services (T1210), Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002), and Alternate Authentication Material (T1550). However, there is no mention of SAML tokens or AD FS servers in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement, but this technique is not among the related TTPs. The question also mentions a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control, but this is not directly related to Lateral Movement or the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the Explosive Trojan will use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control. Since the related TTPs do not include the use of SAML tokens or AD FS servers for Lateral Movement, it is unlikely that the Explosive Trojan will use this method. Therefore, the answer is No.
