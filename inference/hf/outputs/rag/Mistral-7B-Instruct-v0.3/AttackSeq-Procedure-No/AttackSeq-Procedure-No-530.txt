 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Dropping Elephant will scan specific lists of target IP addresses before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware, given that they have already targeted diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already performed Reconnaissance to gather victim identity information (T1589) and is likely to perform Scanning IP Blocks (T1595.001) as part of the Reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information (already performed to identify targets)
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks (scanning specific lists of target IP addresses to identify vulnerable systems)
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery (executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that Dropping Elephant will scan specific lists of target IP addresses (T1595.001) before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware (T1083). Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
