 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only afterwards, given that attackers used Arabic language decoy documents as part of their phishing strategy during the initial access phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used a spearphishing link (T1566.002) to gain initial access, and then used a malicious link (T1204.001) to execute the malware. However, there is no mention of C2 information collection from Pastebin links or Google+ profiles in the initial access phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the attackers first use a phishing strategy (initial access), then the malware is executed (execution), and finally, the malware collects C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they only show the initial access and execution stages. There is no evidence in the related TTPs to suggest that the C2 information collection occurs afterwards.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only afterwards. Given the sequence of events suggested in the question and the lack of evidence in the related TTPs, it is not likely that this sequence of TTPs occurred. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
