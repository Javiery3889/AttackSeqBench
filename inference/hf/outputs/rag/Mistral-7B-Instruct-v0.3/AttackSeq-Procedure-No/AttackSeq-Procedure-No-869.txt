 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational for communications.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The TTPs provided are related to Exfiltration (T1041) and Command and Control (T1008). T1041 describes the technique of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, and T1008 describes the use of fallback channels for C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after data collection and exfiltration. The TTP T1041 describes exfiltration over the C2 channel, which would typically happen after data collection. The TTP T1008 describes a fallback C&C server, which could be used as a backup communication channel. If the primary C&C server is not operational, the attacker might use the fallback server for communication before sending data over the C2 channel. Therefore, it is plausible that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational for communications.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events after data collection and exfiltration.
   - T1041 describes exfiltration over the C2 channel, which would typically happen after data collection.
   - T1008 describes a fallback C&C server, which could be used as a backup communication channel.
   - If the primary C&C server is not operational, the attacker might use the fallback server for communication before sending data over the C2 channel.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational for communications.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
