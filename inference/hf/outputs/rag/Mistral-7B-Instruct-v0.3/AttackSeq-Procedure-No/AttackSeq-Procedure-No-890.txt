 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if BlackEnergy2 is likely to perform system service discovery after executing malicious plugins for creating backup communication channels and collecting USB drive information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Discovery is a tactic used by BlackEnergy2, with specific techniques being System Service Discovery (T1007), Peripheral Device Discovery (T1120), and System Information Discovery (T1082).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the execution of plugins for creating backup communication channels and collecting USB drive information, but it does not suggest any system service discovery or system information gathering activities. The 'dstr.dll' plugin is associated with acts of sabotage, which typically come after the discovery phase in an attack sequence. Therefore, it is less likely that BlackEnergy2 would perform system service discovery after executing the mentioned plugins and proceed directly to the sabotage phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, it is more plausible that BlackEnergy2 would not perform system service discovery after executing malicious plugins for creating backup communication channels and collecting USB drive information before employing the 'dstr.dll' plugin to overwrite hard drive data in acts of sabotage. The answer is "No".
