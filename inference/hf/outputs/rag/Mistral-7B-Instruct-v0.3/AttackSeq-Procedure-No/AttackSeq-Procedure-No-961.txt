 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will communicate with C2 servers only using HTTP protocol before moving laterally.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) and Lateral Movement (T1570). However, the TTPs do not specify the use of HTTP protocol for lateral movement or communication with C2 servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after lateral movement, and the related TTPs do not suggest that the Lazarus Group's malware will only communicate with C2 servers using HTTP protocol before moving laterally.

4. Conclusion: Given the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains using the HTTP protocol only before moving laterally. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
