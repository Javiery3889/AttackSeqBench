 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an encoded PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File). This suggests that the attacker used a Word document to deliver the initial payload. The TTPs also mention PowerShell (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell) and Visual Basic (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic Scripting) as techniques used in the attack sequence. However, there is no mention of a VBS macro being used to retrieve the PowerShell script.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro. The related TTPs do not suggest that a VBS macro is used to retrieve the PowerShell script. Therefore, it is unlikely that the PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that an encoded PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the initial access was gained through a malicious Word document, but there is no mention of a VBS macro being used to retrieve the PowerShell script.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro. Final Answer: B: No.
