 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Aria-body loader will establish persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key only after sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Aria-body backdoor is used for Discovery (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery) and Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder). However, the question does not specify a direct relationship between sending data to the C&C domain and establishing persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not necessarily support this sequence. The Discovery and Persistence TTPs can occur independently of each other. Therefore, it is not likely that the Aria-body loader will establish persistence only after sending collected data to the C&C domain.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include sending data to the C&C domain as a prerequisite for establishing persistence. Therefore, the answer is "No".
