 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the attacker is likely to confirm communication with the target device via a ping command only after using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers for communication.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Command and Control (T1205) and Discovery (T1016.001) techniques. T1205 is about establishing communication with the compromised system, while T1016.001 is about discovering information about the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the attacker first uses net use for lateral movement, then uses compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers, and finally confirms communication with the target device via a ping command. However, the related TTPs do not suggest such a sequence. Instead, T1205 (Command and Control) would typically be used to establish communication before any other actions, and T1016.001 (Internet Connection Discovery) could be used at any point during the attack to gather information about the network. The ping command is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, and its use is not necessarily dependent on the use of compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that the attacker would confirm communication with the target device via a ping command only after using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers for communication. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
