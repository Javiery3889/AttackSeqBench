 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the FHAPPI campaign utilizing fileless techniques after establishing a connection with the C2 server.
2. The related TTPs mention the use of multi-stage channels (T1104) and PowerShell (T1059.001) for execution.
3. The use of multi-stage channels often involves downloading and executing payloads in stages, which is what the question describes.
4. After downloading and executing payloads, it is a common tactic to use fileless techniques to avoid detection, as they do not leave a persistent file on the system.
5. In this case, it is likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques after establishing a connection with the C2 server to further evade detection.
6. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
