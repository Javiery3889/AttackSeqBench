 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after a phishing email is used to gain initial access with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro.
2. The related TTPs provided include T1053.005 (Persistence - Scheduled Task) and T1559.001 (Execution - Component Object Model). T1059.005 (Execution - Visual Basic) is also mentioned, but it is not directly related to the question as it refers to PowerShell, not VBA.
3. T1559.001 (Component Object Model) describes the use of COM objects to execute commands, which aligns with the VBA macro in the question.
4. The question then asks if the VBA macro will use a COM object to gather system information before establishing persistence. Since the TTPs provided suggest that the malware will establish persistence using a scheduled task, it is likely that the VBA macro will first use a COM object to gather system information before creating the scheduled task.
5. Finally, the question asks if the malware will establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. This is consistent with the TTP T1053.005 (Persistence - Scheduled Task).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1559.001 (Execution - Component Object Model) to execute the VBA macro
- T1559.001 (Execution - Component Object Model) to gather system information
- T1053.005 (Persistence - Scheduled Task) to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.
