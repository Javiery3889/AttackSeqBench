 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely to observe the malicious document leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell to achieve execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell, which is related to PowerShell being used for execution, but there is no mention of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about DDE, but the related TTPs do not mention DDE. PowerShell is mentioned, but it is not necessarily related to DDE. Therefore, it is less likely that the malicious document would use DDE via PowerShell.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely to observe the malicious document leveraging the DDE technique via PowerShell to achieve execution. However, the related TTPs do not mention DDE, and PowerShell is not necessarily related to DDE. Therefore, it is less likely that the malicious document would use DDE via PowerShell. Final Answer: B: No.
