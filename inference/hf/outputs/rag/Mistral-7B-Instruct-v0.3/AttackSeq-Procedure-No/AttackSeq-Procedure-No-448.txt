 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Agrius, after performing IPsec Helper TTP (T1086) to await commands from C2 servers, is likely to deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction activities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction and Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe. These TTPs suggest that data destruction activities are being discussed, but they do not specify the tool used for these activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the specific tool CaddyWiper, which is not mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question does mention IPsec Helper, which is not related to CaddyWiper. Therefore, it is unlikely that Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper immediately after using IPsec Helper.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Agrius would perform data destruction activities (as suggested by the related TTPs), but it is not likely that they would deploy CaddyWiper specifically after using IPsec Helper. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
