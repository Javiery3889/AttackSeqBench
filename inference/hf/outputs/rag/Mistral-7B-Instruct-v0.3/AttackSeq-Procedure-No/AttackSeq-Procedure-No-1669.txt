 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is communicating with C2 servers using standard and non-standard encodings (T1132.001 and T1132.002). This suggests that the malware is capable of obfuscating its communication, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Command and Control (T1132) is typically followed by the Tactic of Discovery (T1082) in an attack sequence. The malware first establishes a connection with the C2 server, then it collects system and network information to better understand its environment and plan further actions. In this case, the malware has already used encrypted and base64-encoded commands to communicate with the C2 server, which is a common step before performing discovery activities. Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is communicating with C2 servers using standard and non-standard encodings, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.
   - The Tactic of Command and Control (T1132) is typically followed by the Tactic of Discovery (T1082) in an attack sequence.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
