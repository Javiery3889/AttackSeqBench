 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it's likely that the attackers gained initial access through opportunistic phishing emails and created backdoors on compromised systems only after executing malicious payloads including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool, given that they escalated privileges by leveraging control weaknesses in the Windows network.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which suggests that the initial access was gained through a phishing email. However, there's no mention of Tactic: Initial Access being part of the sequence described in the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence described in the question does not include the initial access phase, which is typically the first step in an attack sequence. The question mentions privilege escalation and the execution of malicious payloads, but it does not mention the initial access phase. The initial access phase is usually achieved through techniques like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or gaining physical access. In this case, the question does not provide evidence that the initial access was achieved through the execution of malicious payloads, which is the last step mentioned in the question.

4. The question describes a sequence where the attackers first escalated privileges, then executed malicious payloads, and possibly created backdoors. However, the initial access phase is missing from this sequence. The initial access phase is typically the first step in an attack sequence, and it's unlikely that the attackers would skip this step. Therefore, it's more plausible that the initial access was achieved through a method other than the execution of malicious payloads, such as phishing or exploiting a vulnerability. Since the question does not provide evidence that the initial access was achieved through the execution of malicious payloads, the answer is "No".
