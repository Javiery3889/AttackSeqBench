 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase. The question does not mention any TTPs related to data collection, but rather focuses on the use of a Base64-encoded token and communication with a Command and Control server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding, which indicates the use of a Command and Control server and the encoding of data for communication. The TTPs also mention the Tactic: Discovery and Techniques T1082-System Information Discovery and T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which suggest that the malware may gather information about the system and its files. However, there is no mention of data collection related to text messages, contact lists, or geo-location data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about data collection, but the related TTPs do not provide any evidence to suggest that data collection of the specified type (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) will occur during the Discovery phase. The use of a Base64-encoded token and communication with a Command and Control server do not inherently imply data collection of the specified type. Therefore, it is more likely that the malware will not collect this type of data during the Discovery phase.

In conclusion, the malware is likely not to collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.
