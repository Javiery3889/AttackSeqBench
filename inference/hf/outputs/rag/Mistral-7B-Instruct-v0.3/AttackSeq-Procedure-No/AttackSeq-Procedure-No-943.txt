 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if attackers will execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation before using the PowerShell loader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through exploiting CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782, and a PowerShell loader was executed. However, there is no mention of privilege escalation before the PowerShell loader.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific sequence of events, and the related TTPs do not suggest that the attackers would execute backdoors with system privileges before using the PowerShell loader. The PowerShell loader is mentioned after the initial access and custom shellcode execution, but there is no indication that it was used for privilege escalation.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the attackers would first execute the PowerShell loader and then potentially use it for further actions, such as downloading and executing backdoors, but not necessarily for privilege escalation before the PowerShell loader. Therefore, the answer is "No".
