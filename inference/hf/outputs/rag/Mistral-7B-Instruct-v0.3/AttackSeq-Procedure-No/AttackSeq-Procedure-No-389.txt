 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after bypassing antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
2. The related TTPs provided mention Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1562.001 (Disable or Modify Tools) and T1055 (Process Injection).
3. AtomBombing is a technique under T1055 (Process Injection), which involves leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms for malicious code injection and executing it via legitimate programs.
4. Since the threat actors have already bypassed several defense evasion solutions, it is plausible that they would continue with another technique from the same tactic (Defense Evasion) to further evade detection, which is AtomBombing in this case.
5. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
