 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if MuddyWater, after hosting malicious code as part of their Command and Control operations, is likely to use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Execution with Technique T1204.002 - Malicious File, and the Tactic of Command and Control with Technique T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Execution (T1204.002) involves the use of malicious files, which aligns with the question's mention of downloading files infected with macros. The Tactic of Command and Control (T1105) is also mentioned, which suggests that the attacker is using compromised servers for their operations, as stated in the question. Therefore, it is plausible that MuddyWater would use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that MuddyWater would use compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros for initial access (Answer A).
