 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will gather information about the infected computer after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is performing a Collection tactic (T1005) and a Discovery tactic (T1083). These TTPs suggest that the malware is gathering data from the local system and discovering files and directories.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the next step after collecting data and discovering files/directories. However, the related TTPs do not indicate that the malware will specifically gather information about the system and user names for transmission through encrypted emails. Instead, T1005 and T1083 focus on data collection and discovery, not information gathering.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the malware will gather information about the infected computer after collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents. The related TTPs do not suggest this sequence of events, as they focus on data collection and discovery, not information gathering. Therefore, the answer is No.
