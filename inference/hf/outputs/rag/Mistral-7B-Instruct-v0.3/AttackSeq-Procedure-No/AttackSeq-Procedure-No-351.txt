 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions an initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file. This aligns with the Technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.

2. The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component. This is a question about the Tactic: Command and Control.

3. The related TTPs include T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a technique for Command and Control, but it involves web protocols, not custom TCP protocols as mentioned in the question. However, the Tactic: Command and Control is still relevant.

4. The question also mentions a non-standard port, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the use of non-standard ports is often associated with establishing command and control connections, which is a common practice for malware like MSIL/Crimson.

5. Given that the question mentions the establishment of command and control using a custom TCP protocol, the most plausible answer is A: Yes, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001. This aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control, but not with the specific technique T1071.001-Web Protocols mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question does not specify the type of web protocol, so it's possible that a custom TCP protocol could be used within a web protocol context, but that is not the focus of the question.
