 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the 9002 RAT is likely to download additional payloads onto an infected machine for Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control (T1105) and the technique of Ingress Tool Transfer. This suggests that the attacker is likely to transfer additional tools or payloads to the compromised system for further control and manipulation.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the initial infection and persistence through a PowerShell script. While this does not directly indicate the downloading of additional payloads, the related TTPs suggest that such an action is likely to follow as part of the Command and Control phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker has already established persistence on the infected machine (T1059.001).
   - The use of PowerShell indicates a potential for further scripting and automation (T1059.001).
   - The related TTP of T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer suggests that the attacker is likely to transfer additional tools or payloads for Command and Control.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the 9002 RAT will download additional payloads onto the infected machine for Command and Control.
