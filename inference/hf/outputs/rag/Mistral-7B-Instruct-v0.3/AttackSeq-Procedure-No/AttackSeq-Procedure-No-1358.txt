 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will establish command and control (Tactic: Command and Control) after the TAIDOOR loader decrypts and executes the RAT files in memory.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the technique T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication and T1102 - Web Service, both of which are techniques used for Command and Control. These techniques can involve the use of various platforms, including social networking sites and cloud platforms like Twitter, Dropbox, and Mediafire.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the establishment of command and control, and the related TTPs provide examples of techniques used for this purpose. The answer choice A: Yes aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that the malware could use these platforms for command and control, which is in line with the TTPs provided.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the malware will establish command and control by leveraging social networking sites and cloud platforms like Twitter, Dropbox, and Mediafire. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
