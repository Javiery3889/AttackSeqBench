 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for the app to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols, which refers to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. Additionally, the Tactic: Exfiltration and Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol is also mentioned, which refers to the exfiltration of data using unencrypted non-command and control protocols.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the app uploads files via FTP protocol. The related TTPs do not suggest that the app will only send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. Instead, they suggest that the app may use web protocols (HTTP) for command and control communication and exfiltration using unencrypted non-command and control protocols. However, the question does not specify that the app will perform routines on the iOS device before sending the information via HTTP. Therefore, it is not likely that the app will send the information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely for the app to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that the app will only send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the app will send the information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
