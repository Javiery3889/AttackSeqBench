 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT41, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails, is likely to conduct reconnaissance activities targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that APT41 has been known to use spear-phishing emails (T1566-Phishing) for initial access and has also been associated with reconnaissance activities, specifically email addresses (T1589.002-Email Addresses) and spear-phishing (T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about reconnaissance activities after initial access, and the related TTPs suggest that APT41 has been known to perform reconnaissance activities. The TTPs T1589.002-Email Addresses and T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice are related to email-based reconnaissance, but they do not specifically mention call record information at telecom companies or hotel reservation systems. However, the question does not specify that the reconnaissance must be limited to the TTPs provided in the related TTPs. APT41 is known for a wide range of activities, and it is plausible that they could extend their reconnaissance to call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about APT41's activities after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.
   - The related TTPs suggest that APT41 has been known to perform reconnaissance activities.
   - While the provided TTPs do not specifically mention call record information at telecom companies or hotel reservation systems, APT41 is known for a wide range of activities, and it is plausible that they could extend their reconnaissance to these areas.
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities such as targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
