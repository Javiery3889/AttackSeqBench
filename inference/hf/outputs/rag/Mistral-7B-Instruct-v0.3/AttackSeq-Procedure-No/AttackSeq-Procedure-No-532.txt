Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim’s machine after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Credential Access and Techniques T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers) and T1539 (Steal Web Session Cookie). These TTPs are related to stealing credentials or cookies from web browsers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the download of additional malware, which could be the Dropping Elephant backdoor. The related TTPs suggest that the Dropping Elephant backdoor might be designed to steal credentials or cookies from web browsers. Therefore, it is plausible that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim’s machine.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware (T1055.003)
   - Dropping Elephant backdoor is downloaded (T1055.001)
   - Dropping Elephant backdoor steals Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies (T1555.003 and T1539)
