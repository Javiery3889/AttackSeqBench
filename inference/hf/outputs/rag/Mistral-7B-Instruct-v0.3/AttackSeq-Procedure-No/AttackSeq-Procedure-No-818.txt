 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer, a known malware, will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the attacker is using Exfiltration techniques, specifically T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol) and T1048.001 (Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is focused on data exfiltration, not C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about C2 communication using FTP, but the related TTPs do not indicate any C2 communication using FTP. Instead, they focus on data exfiltration methods. Therefore, it is less likely that WinDealer will use FTP for C2 communication before it steals information and encrypts it.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the provided related TTPs, it is more plausible that WinDealer will not use the FTP protocol for C2 communication before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES.
