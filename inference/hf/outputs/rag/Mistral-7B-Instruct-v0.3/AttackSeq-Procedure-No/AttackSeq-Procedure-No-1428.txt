Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration after extracting Chrome passwords.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial action is Credential Access (Tactic) using T1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers. This technique is specifically about extracting credentials from Google Chrome's SQLite databases.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information suggesting that the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, or screen images after the initial credential access. The related TTPs do not indicate these additional actions. Therefore, it is not likely that the spyware will perform these actions before exfiltration.
