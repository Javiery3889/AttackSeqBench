 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to gather credentials from Group Policy Preferences before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has persistence through scheduled tasks (T1053.005) and has executed a PowerShell script at memory level (implied by T1053.005, as scheduled tasks often involve scripts). However, there is no mention of Group Policy Preferences (T1552.006) in the question or related TTPs, which suggests that it is not a likely next step in this sequence of TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any evidence that the Cosmic Banker malware would specifically target Group Policy Preferences for credential gathering. Instead, it is more likely that the malware would focus on more direct methods of credential theft, such as keylogging, credential dumping, or phishing.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the Cosmic Banker malware would gather credentials from Group Policy Preferences before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts. The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve persistence, execution, and then credential theft through other methods, but not Group Policy Preferences.
