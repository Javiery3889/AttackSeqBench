 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1550.004-Web Session Cookie (Tactic: Lateral Movement) and T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie (Tactic: Credential Access). However, there is no mention of T1512-Credential Hopping or T1027-WMI Privilege Escalation (which would be related to configuring malware for WMI persistence) in the question or the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about credential hopping or WMI persistence, which are necessary steps for the answer to be "Yes". Therefore, it is not likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include credential hopping or WMI persistence before stealing web session cookies. Therefore, the answer is "No".
