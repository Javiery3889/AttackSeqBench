 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers, after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, will use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement before mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts). This suggests that the attackers are aiming to escalate their privileges within the network, which aligns with the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question and the related TTPs. The use of spearphishing for initial access (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts) is followed by lateral movement using tools like PsExec and WinExe, which is a common technique for Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts). Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use these tools for lateral movement before mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

In summary, the attack sequence is likely to be:
- Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
- Lateral Movement: Use of tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe
- Privilege Escalation: Mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.
