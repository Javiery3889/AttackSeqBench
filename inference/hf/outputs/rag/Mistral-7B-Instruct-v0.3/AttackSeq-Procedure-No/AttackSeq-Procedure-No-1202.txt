 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Lazarus Group is likely to achieve persistence by executing IMAPLoader via the AppDomainManager injection technique before employing techniques to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Tactic: Persistence (T1574) and Technique: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable for control flow hijacking. However, there is no mention of AppDomainManager injection or IMAPLoader in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after control flow hijacking, but the related TTPs do not suggest that Lazarus Group uses AppDomainManager injection or IMAPLoader as the next step. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would use these techniques in the sequence described in the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not plausible that Lazarus Group would achieve persistence by executing IMAPLoader via the AppDomainManager injection technique before employing techniques to evade detection as described in the question. The answer is "No".
