 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will perform credential dumping after system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory. This technique involves dumping credentials from the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process memory.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the related TTPs. System fingerprinting and domain trust discovery are often initial reconnaissance steps in an attack, followed by credential access. The use of tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe for these initial steps is common, and Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, often used in conjunction with PowerShell scripts to read the memory of lsass.exe. Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers will perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and read the memory of lsass.exe.

In conclusion, the answer is "Yes". The attackers are likely to perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and read the memory of lsass.exe after system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.
