 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will bypass UAC only after employing defense evasion techniques such as abusing elevation control mechanisms.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Privilege Escalation and Technique T1548.002 (Bypass User Account Control) are relevant. However, Defense Evasion is not mentioned in the related TTPs, which suggests that the attacker may not necessarily employ defense evasion techniques before bypassing UAC.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs do not suggest a sequence that includes defense evasion before UAC bypass. Therefore, it is not likely that Earth Lusca will bypass UAC only after employing defense evasion techniques such as abusing elevation control mechanisms.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs do not suggest a sequence that includes defense evasion before UAC bypass. Therefore, it is not likely that Earth Lusca will bypass UAC only after employing defense evasion techniques such as abusing elevation control mechanisms.
   - Final Answer: No.
