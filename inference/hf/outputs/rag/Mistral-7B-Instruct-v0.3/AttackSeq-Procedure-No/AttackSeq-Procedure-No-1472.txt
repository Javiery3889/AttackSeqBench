 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection after performing a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link, which is a technique used to deliver malware through malicious hyperlinks. This technique is often used in phishing campaigns. The Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is also mentioned, which is a technique used to deliver malware through emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about establishing a C2 connection, which is a Tactic: Command and Control (T1086). However, the related TTPs do not explicitly mention T1086. Instead, they mention T1204.001 (Malicious Link) and T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link), which are techniques often used to deliver malware, such as the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, to target systems. After delivering the RAT, it is likely that the adversaries will use the RAT to establish a C2 connection, which can be done by the victim clicking on malicious hyperlinks within the emails they received during the phishing campaign.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (delivering the RAT through a phishing email)
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link (clicking on the malicious hyperlink to establish a C2 connection)

This sequence aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.
