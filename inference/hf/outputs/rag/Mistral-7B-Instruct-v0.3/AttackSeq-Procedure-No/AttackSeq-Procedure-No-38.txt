 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Machete, a TTP not mentioned in the question, will perform a specific DNS calculation to get a command and control port before exfiltrating data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that data is being staged locally (T1074.001-Local Data Staging) and that command and control communication is taking place (T1568.003-DNS Calculation). However, there is no mention of Machete or any specific behavior related to it in the question or the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Machete is not mentioned in the question or the related TTPs, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would perform the specific DNS calculation described in the question. Therefore, it is unlikely that Machete would perform this action.

4. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, it is more plausible that Machete will not multiply the first two octets of an IP address and add the third octet to that value to get a resulting command and control port before exfiltrating data.
