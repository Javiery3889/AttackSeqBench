 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails after employing COM object hijacking for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing (T1566.001 or T1566.002), and persistence was achieved through COM object hijacking (T1546.015). However, there is no mention of a Stage-1 downloader or any other technique that suggests the distribution of Zebrocy components after initial access and persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the distribution of Zebrocy components, but the related TTPs do not provide any evidence to suggest that this would happen after a spearphishing attack and COM object hijacking. The sequence of TTPs seems to be: Initial Access (Spearphishing) -> Persistence (COM Object Hijacking). There is no indication of a Stage-1 downloader or further distribution of Zebrocy components in the given information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the Sednit groupâ€™s operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails after using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader. Final Answer: No.
