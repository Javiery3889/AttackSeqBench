 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, after automatically exfiltrating collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware uses Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control and does not specify the use of HTTPS or custom data encoding algorithms for obfuscation. However, the Exfiltration technique (T1041) used a HTTP GET request, which is a clear text protocol, not HTTPS.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of HTTPS and custom data encoding algorithms after exfiltration. The related TTPs do not indicate the use of HTTPS or custom data encoding algorithms, and the exfiltration technique used a clear text protocol (HTTP GET). Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the malware will use HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm after exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs do not indicate the use of HTTPS or custom data encoding algorithms, and the exfiltration technique used a clear text protocol (HTTP GET).
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
