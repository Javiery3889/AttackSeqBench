 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only after gathering data from network shared drives.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Korplug malware collects data from local systems and removable media (T1025-Data from Removable Media, T1005-Data from Local System). This suggests that Korplug malware may collect data from these sources before moving on to other actions, such as data exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a specific sequence of events: data collection, then data exfiltration via a custom TCP-based protocol. However, the related TTPs do not indicate that Korplug malware only performs data exfiltration after gathering data from network shared drives. In fact, the TTPs suggest that Korplug malware may collect data from various sources before deciding on the method of data exfiltration. Therefore, it is more plausible that Korplug malware would perform data collection from local systems and removable media before moving on to data exfiltration, not necessarily via a custom TCP-based protocol from network shared drives.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Korplug malware would collect data from local systems and removable media before proceeding with data exfiltration, not necessarily via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only after gathering data from network shared drives. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
