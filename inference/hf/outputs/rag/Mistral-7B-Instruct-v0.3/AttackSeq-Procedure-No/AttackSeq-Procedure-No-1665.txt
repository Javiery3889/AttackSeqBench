 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities and then perform execution using process hollowing after initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware may use techniques for Discovery (T1518.001), Defense Evasion (T1055.012), and Initial Access (T1566).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Initial Access (T1566) - The attacker gains access to the system through spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
   - Discovery (T1518.001) - After gaining initial access, the malware may engage in discovery activities to gather system information and network views to better understand the environment it is operating in.
   - Defense Evasion (T1055.012) - To evade detection, the malware may use process hollowing, which is a technique for executing malicious code within a legitimate process.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (T1566) -> Discovery (T1518.001) -> Defense Evasion (T1055.012). This sequence aligns with the question's description of the malware first gaining initial access, then engaging in discovery activities, and finally using process hollowing for execution.
