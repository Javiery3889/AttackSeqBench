 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading) and the Tactic of Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not provide a clear sequence. However, the Tactic of Initial Access (T1566.001) is typically the first step in an attack sequence, while Defense Evasion (T1036) is often used after Initial Access to avoid detection. The question suggests that the attackers first use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion, but the related TTPs do not mention this step. Therefore, it is unlikely that the attackers would first use simplified PostScript syntax for defense evasion and then exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability for initial access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not align with the answer choices provided. Therefore, the answer is "No".
