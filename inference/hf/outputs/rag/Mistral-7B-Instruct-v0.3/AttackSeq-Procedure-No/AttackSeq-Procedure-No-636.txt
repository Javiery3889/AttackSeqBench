 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers loaded a plist file using the launchctl command before malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent, Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1569.001-Launchctl, and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise. However, none of these TTPs directly relate to the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a website.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the loading of a plist file using the launchctl command, which is a technique related to Tactic: Execution (T1569.001). However, the question does not mention any privilege escalation or initial access activities, which are more closely associated with T1543.001 and T1189 respectively. The question also does not mention any exploitation of CVE-2019-13720, which is related to Tactic: Initial Access (T1189).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks about the loading of a plist file using the launchctl command before the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a website. The related TTPs do not suggest that this sequence of events is likely. The attack sequence described in the question seems to start with the Drive-by Compromise (T1189) of a website, followed by the insertion of malicious JavaScript code, and then the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720). The loading of a plist file using the launchctl command does not seem to fit into this sequence. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
