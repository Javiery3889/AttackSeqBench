 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks if SparrowDoor, after executing commands and communicating with a C&C server, is likely to have exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Initial Access and the Technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application. This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access to a target system.

3. The technique T1059.003-Windows Command Shell, which is part of the Execution tactic, is about executing commands using the Windows Command Shell. This technique is often used after Initial Access has been achieved, not necessarily as the initial method of gaining access.

4. Given that SparrowDoor is a tool often used for remote code execution, and the question specifically asks about Initial Access, it is more likely that SparrowDoor would have exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain Initial Access, as suggested by the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application TTP. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
