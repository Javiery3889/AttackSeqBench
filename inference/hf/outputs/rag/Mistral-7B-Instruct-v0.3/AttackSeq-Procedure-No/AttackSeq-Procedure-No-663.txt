 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the threat actors will evade defenses using a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader before leveraging the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting CVE-2019-0604, which is a known vulnerability in Remote Desktop Services. The TTPs also suggest that PowerShell (T1059.001) was used in the execution phase. However, there is no mention of Defense Evasion (T1218) or Mimikatz (T1003) in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not indicate the use of Mimikatz or a .NET loader for defense evasion before using the AntSword webshell for system and user discovery. Therefore, it is unlikely that the sequence of TTPs described in the question will occur.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the threat actors will evade defenses using a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader before leveraging the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting CVE-2019-0604 and PowerShell was used in the execution phase, but there is no mention of Defense Evasion (T1218) or Mimikatz (T1003).
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the sequence of TTPs described in the question will occur. Final Answer: No.
