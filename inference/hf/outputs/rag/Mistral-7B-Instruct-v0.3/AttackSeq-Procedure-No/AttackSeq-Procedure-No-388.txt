 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon after executing malicious code by exploiting the AtomBombing technique.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs involve Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1036-Masquerading and T1564.009-Resource Forking. These TTPs are used to hide malicious activities and disguise malware as benign files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about disguising the executable's icon, which aligns with the T1036-Masquerading technique. However, the question specifically mentions the use of a resource fork, which is a feature of macOS files that allows additional data to be stored with the file. This is related to T1564.009-Resource Forking. Since the question asks about disguising the icon of an executable on macOS, using a resource fork to present a different icon (e.g., a JPEG or text file icon) would be a plausible sequence of TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: After executing malicious code by exploiting the AtomBombing technique, threat actors may use a resource fork (T1564.009-Resource Forking) to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon (T1036-Masquerading) rather than the executable's icon assigned by the operating system. Final Answer: Yes.
