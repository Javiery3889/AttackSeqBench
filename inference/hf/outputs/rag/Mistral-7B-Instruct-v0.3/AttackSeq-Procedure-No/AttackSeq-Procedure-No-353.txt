 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase after the downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: T1059.001 refers to the use of PowerShell for PowerShell-based scripts. However, this technique does not inherently involve downloading a Windows executable or a decoy document.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the execution phase, and the related TTP (T1059.001) does not suggest the download of a Windows executable or a decoy document. Therefore, it is less likely that these actions will occur in the sequence described.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTP, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is B: No. The PowerShell scripts are likely to perform actions related to T1059.001 (PowerShell-based scripts), but not necessarily download a Windows executable or a decoy document during the execution phase.
