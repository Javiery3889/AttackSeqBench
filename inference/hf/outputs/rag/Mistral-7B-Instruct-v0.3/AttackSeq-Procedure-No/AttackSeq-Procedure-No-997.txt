 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware after infecting a target with Plexor malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery tactic is relevant, specifically techniques T1518.001, T1497.002, and T1083. These techniques involve security software discovery, user activity-based checks, and file and directory discovery, respectively.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that Longhorn's tools are espionage-focused malware. Espionage malware often involves gathering information about the target system to better understand its defenses and navigate undetected. The related TTPs support this, as they all involve discovery techniques.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: After infecting a target with Plexor malware, it is likely that Longhorn's tools (the espionage-focused malware) will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. This is because these discovery techniques are essential for an attacker to understand the target system and operate undetected. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
