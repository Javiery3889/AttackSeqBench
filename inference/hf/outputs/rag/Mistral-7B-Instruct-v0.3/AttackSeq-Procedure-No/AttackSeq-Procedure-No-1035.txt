 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after APT10 has logged into the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic: Initial Access (T1078.002 - Domain Accounts) and the Tactic: Credential Access (T1003.003 - NTDS). This suggests that the attacker may use domain accounts for initial access and then attempt to access the NTDS database for credential theft.
3. Mimikatz is a tool often used for Tactic: Credential Access (T1003) to extract credentials from memory.
4. Once the attacker has obtained the credentials, they can use them to access the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002 - Domain Accounts).
5. After accessing the domain controller, the attacker can deploy Trochilus (a known malware associated with APT10) and copy the NTDS.DIT database file (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1070.001 - Initial Access to Restart).
6. Therefore, it is likely that APT10 will use Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.
