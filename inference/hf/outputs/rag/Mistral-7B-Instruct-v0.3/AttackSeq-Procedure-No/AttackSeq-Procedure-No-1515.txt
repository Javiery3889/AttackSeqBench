 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel after shutting down the victim's computer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker's primary objective is to disrupt the system (Impact) and shut it down (T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot). There is no mention of data exfiltration (Exfiltration) in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exfiltration, but the related TTPs do not suggest any exfiltration activity. Therefore, it is unlikely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel after shutting down the victim's computer.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the backdoor will exfiltrate data after shutting down the victim's computer.
   - The related TTPs do not indicate any exfiltration activity.
