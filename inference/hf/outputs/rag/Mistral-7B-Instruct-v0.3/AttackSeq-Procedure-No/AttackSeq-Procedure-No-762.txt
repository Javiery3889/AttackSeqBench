 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Charming Kitten group will intercept private keys using a trojanized ssh-add function after utilizing phishing attempts to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is interested in Credential Access tactics, specifically T1552.004-Private Keys and T1556-Modify Authentication Process. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is focused on gaining access to private keys and modifying the authentication process, which aligns with the trojanized ssh-add function mentioned in the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Given the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the Charming Kitten group would continue their credential harvesting by intercepting private keys using a trojanized ssh-add function, as this aligns with the Credential Access tactics they have already employed (phishing for credentials). Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
