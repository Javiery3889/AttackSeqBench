 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that BlueBravo will gather victim system information before employing defense evasion techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that BlueBravo may use System Information Discovery (T1082) to gather victim system information, and Defense Evasion techniques such as DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs suggested by the question is: System Information Discovery (T1082) -> Defense Evasion (T1574.001). However, the related TTPs suggest a different sequence: Defense Evasion (T1574.001) -> System Information Discovery (T1082).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: It is more likely that an attacker would first employ defense evasion techniques to avoid detection, and then gather system information to better understand the target environment. Therefore, the answer is No, BlueBravo will not gather victim system information only before employing defense evasion techniques. Instead, they may gather system information after employing defense evasion techniques.
