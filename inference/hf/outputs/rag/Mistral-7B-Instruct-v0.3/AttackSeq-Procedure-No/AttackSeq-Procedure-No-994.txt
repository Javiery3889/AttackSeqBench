 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in Exfiltration activities, specifically T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. However, there is no mention of a specific time interval for data exfiltration in the question or the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide evidence that the malware exfiltrates data every 10 minutes. The related TTPs only suggest that the malware is capable of exfiltration, but they do not specify the frequency of this activity. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware does not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the malware exfiltrates data every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the malware is capable of exfiltration, but they do not specify the frequency of this activity.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not likely that the malware exfiltrates data every 10 minutes.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
