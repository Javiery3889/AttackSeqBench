 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) only after proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is focusing on Defense Evasion techniques, specifically T1036.005 (Match Legitimate Name or Location), T1553.006 (Code Signing Policy Modification), and T1112 (Modify Registry). However, there is no mention of T1547 (Kernel-Level Rootkit) or T1553.007 (DKOM) in the question or related TTPs, which are directly related to deploying a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the deployment of a backdoor and the creation of a service in the registry, but it does not mention any system information discovery or screen capture functionalities. The related TTPs do not suggest that these functionalities are a prerequisite for deploying a kernel rootkit. Therefore, it is not likely that Deep Panda would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit after proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit after system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that these functionalities are a prerequisite for deploying a kernel rootkit.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Deep Panda would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit after proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
