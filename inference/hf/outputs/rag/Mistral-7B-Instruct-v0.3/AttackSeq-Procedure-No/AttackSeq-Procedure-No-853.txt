 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Dexphot, after using fileless techniques for defense evasion, is likely to use process hollowing during the execution stage.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that process hollowing (T1055.012) is a technique used for both Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after defense evasion, so we focus on the Defense Evasion TTP.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after defense evasion, and the related TTPs show that process hollowing can be used for defense evasion (T1055.012). Therefore, it is plausible that Dexphot, after using fileless techniques for defense evasion, would use process hollowing to further evade detection and obfuscate its activities during the execution stage.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that Dexphot would use process hollowing after using fileless techniques for defense evasion. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
