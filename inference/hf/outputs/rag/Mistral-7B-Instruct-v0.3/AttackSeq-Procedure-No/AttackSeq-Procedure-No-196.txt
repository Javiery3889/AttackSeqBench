 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the primary focus of the attack is on credential access, specifically through keylogging (T1056.001). This technique involves capturing keystrokes to steal credentials. However, the TTPs also mention T1056-Input Capture, which is a more general technique for capturing input from the user, including mouse movements.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the attacker's primary goal is to capture credentials, they would initially focus on keylogging. However, capturing mouse movements can provide additional information that could be useful for further exploitation, such as identifying patterns in user behavior or navigating to sensitive areas within compromised systems. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware could also utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided information, it is likely that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will utilize tools to capture mouse movements (Answer: Yes). This is because capturing mouse movements could provide additional information that could be useful for further exploitation, even though the primary focus is on credential access.
