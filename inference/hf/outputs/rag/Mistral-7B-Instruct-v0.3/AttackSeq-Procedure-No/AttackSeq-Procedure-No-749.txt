 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant, which has already used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration, would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic: Command and Control and Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding were used, which suggests that the implant may use standard encoding methods for communication with the control server. Additionally, the Tactic: Defense Evasion and Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information were mentioned, which implies that the implant may use obfuscation techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the implant has already used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration, it is plausible that it would continue to use these techniques for communication with the control server. The use of HTTP POST requests is not explicitly stated in the question or related TTPs, but it is a common method for data transmission in a command and control context. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the implant would use HTTP POST requests, given the context provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The Rising Sun implant has already used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration, which suggests that it may use these techniques for communication with the control server. Given the context provided, it is plausible that the implant would use HTTP POST requests for data transmission. Therefore, it is likely that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. Final Answer: Yes.
