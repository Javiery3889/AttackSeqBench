 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Russian-speaking cybercriminals will explore the financial systems of the targeted organizations using remote administration tools in the discovery phase, after causing multi-million dollar losses and transferring or withdrawing money during the impact phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery tactic (T1018) involves remote system discovery, while the Impact tactic (T1657) involves financial theft.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Discovery phase, but the related TTPs provided do not indicate the use of remote administration tools in the Discovery phase. Instead, they show the use of remote system discovery in the Discovery phase and financial theft in the Impact phase. Since the question asks about the Discovery phase, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "No". The cybercriminals have already caused financial losses and withdrawn money during the Impact phase, and it is less likely that they would go back to the Discovery phase to explore the financial systems using remote administration tools.
