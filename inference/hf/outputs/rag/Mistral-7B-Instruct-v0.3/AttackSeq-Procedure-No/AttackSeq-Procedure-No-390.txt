 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use a VBA script after using AtomBombing for malicious code injection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1221) and Technique: T1059.005 (Visual Basic). These TTPs are related to evading detection by using templates for malicious code injection and using Visual Basic scripts, respectively. However, they do not directly indicate the use of VBA scripts in the context of AtomBombing.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of VBA scripts after AtomBombing. The related TTPs do not provide evidence that VBA scripts are used in this sequence. AtomBombing is a technique for code injection into legitimate programs, and VBA scripts are typically used for macros in Microsoft Office applications, such as Word or Excel. While there could be scenarios where both techniques are used in an attack, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events after AtomBombing, and the related TTPs do not suggest that a VBA script would be used immediately after AtomBombing.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if threat actors will use a VBA script after AtomBombing.
   - The related TTPs do not provide evidence that VBA scripts are used in this sequence.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that they will use a VBA script as part of their strategy after AtomBombing.
   - Final Answer: No.
