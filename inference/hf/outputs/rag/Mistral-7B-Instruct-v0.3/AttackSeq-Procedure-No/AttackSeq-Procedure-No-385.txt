 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: APT15 deployed backdoors and bypassed command prompt policy settings for execution. The question asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Initial Access (T1078.002-Domain Accounts), Credential Access (T1552.004-Private Keys), and Credential Access (T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate. The related TTPs suggest that the attack involves credential access, specifically private keys (T1552.004) and Windows Credential Manager (T1555.004), which are techniques often used by Mimikatz. The initial access tactic (T1078.002) could be related to the deployment of backdoors, but it does not directly answer the question about Mimikatz and VPN certificates. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access: T1078.002-Domain Accounts (deployment of backdoors)
   - Credential Access: T1552.004-Private Keys (Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials)
   - Credential Access: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager (Mimikatz to steal a VPN certificate)

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access: APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS, which allowed them to gain access to the network.
   - Credential Access: To escalate their privileges, APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and access the Windows Credential Manager to steal a VPN certificate. This allowed them to move laterally within the network and access it remotely.

Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
