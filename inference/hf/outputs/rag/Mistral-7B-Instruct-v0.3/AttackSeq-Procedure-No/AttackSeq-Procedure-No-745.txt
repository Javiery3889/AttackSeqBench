 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Crimson RAT will be downloaded from a specified IP address before the malicious macro code within the XLS document executes to first drop a Crimson RAT downloader.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves a spear phishing campaign (T1566.001) with a malicious file (T1204.002), and the use of defense evasion techniques such as template injection (T1221). However, there is no mention of downloading the Crimson RAT from a specific IP address before the malicious macro code executes.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs do not suggest that the Crimson RAT is downloaded before the malicious macro code executes. The malicious macro code is likely to execute first, as it is the initial step in the attack sequence (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment), and then the downloader for the Crimson RAT might be dropped. Therefore, it is more plausible that the malicious macro code executes before the Crimson RAT is downloaded.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malicious macro code within the XLS document executes before the Crimson RAT is downloaded from the specified IP address. Therefore, the answer is "No".
