 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactic of Discovery is involved, specifically the technique T1082-System Information Discovery, which is about gathering system information. This suggests that the backdoor may indeed gather system information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode, which is a technique often used for establishing a connection between the attacker and the victim. However, this alone does not necessarily imply that the backdoor will or will not gather system information. The related TTPs, specifically T1082-System Information Discovery, suggest that the backdoor is likely to gather system information.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
