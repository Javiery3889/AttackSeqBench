 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group will conduct discovery activities such as file and directory discovery only after utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials during credential access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Lazarus group is known to use T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay for credential access, but there is no mention of file and directory discovery being dependent on this credential access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence where credential access is a prerequisite for discovery. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The Lazarus group could perform discovery activities before or after credential access, but there is no evidence to suggest that they always wait for credential access before conducting discovery.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided information, it is not plausible to assume that the Lazarus group will conduct discovery activities only after utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials during credential access. Therefore, the answer is "No".
