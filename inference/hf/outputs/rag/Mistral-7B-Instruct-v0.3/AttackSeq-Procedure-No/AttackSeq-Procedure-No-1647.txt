 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware gains initial access through a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro. This aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-Phishing.

2. The question then asks if the malware will establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours before the VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe'. This is a sequence of events that can be associated with Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task.

3. The question also mentions that the malware uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. This is a technique related to Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-Phishing, as 'mshta.exe' is a scripting host that can be used to execute malicious scripts, and downloading and executing a dropper is a common method for delivering malware.

4. Given that the question asks about establishing persistence after initial access, and the related TTPs include T1053.005-Scheduled Task, it is likely that the malware will create a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' before the VBA macro, ensuring its persistence on the system. This sequence of events aligns best with answer choice A: Yes.
