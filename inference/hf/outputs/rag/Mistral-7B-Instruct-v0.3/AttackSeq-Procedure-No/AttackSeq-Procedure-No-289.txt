 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Elfin (a known threat actor) will bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands after deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Credential Access (Tactic) and techniques like Keylogging (T1056.001) and Credentials In Files (T1552.001). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in obtaining credentials, not bypassing logging.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about bypassing logging, but the related TTPs do not suggest any TTPs related to logging bypass. Therefore, it is less likely that Elfin will bypass logging using PowerShell commands after deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Elfin will bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in obtaining credentials, not bypassing logging.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that Elfin will bypass logging using PowerShell commands after deploying DarkComet with a credential dumping tool.
   - Final Answer: No.
