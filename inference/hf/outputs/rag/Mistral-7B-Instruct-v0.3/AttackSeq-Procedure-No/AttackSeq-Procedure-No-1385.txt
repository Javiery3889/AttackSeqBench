 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: FIN13 is known to use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for initial access, which allows them to establish a local HTTP server for command execution. The question asks if they are likely to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware after establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols) and the Technique of T1505.003-Web Shell, which is a method used for maintaining persistence. However, there is no mention of exploiting external servers to deploy web shells or custom malware for initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after FIN13 establishes a local HTTP server with BLUEAGAVE. The related TTPs suggest that FIN13 might use web shells (T1505.003) for persistence, but they do not indicate that they will exploit external servers for deploying web shells or custom malware after initial access. The sequence of TTPs seems more likely to be: Initial Access (T1071.001-Web Protocols) -> Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell) rather than Initial Access (T1071.001-Web Protocols) -> Initial Access (exploiting external servers) -> Persistence (T1505.003-Web Shell).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. The related TTPs do not indicate that this is a likely sequence of events. Therefore, the answer is No.
