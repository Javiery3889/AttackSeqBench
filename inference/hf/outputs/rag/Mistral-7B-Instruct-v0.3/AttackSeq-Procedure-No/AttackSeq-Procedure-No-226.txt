 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question starts with a detected suspicious email containing a Word document with a macro dropper designed to execute a JavaScript payload. This aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Macro-based Delivery.

2. The next step is the attacker using CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker. This is a Defense Evasion technique (T1218.003-CMSTP) that is listed among the related TTPs.

3. After bypassing AppLocker, the attacker launches a malicious script. Since the initial payload was JavaScript, it's likely that this script is also JavaScript, which continues the Execution tactic (T1059).

4. The final step is the downloader dropping a file from a specified URL and executing it in the system's temporary directory. This is another Execution technique (T1059.001-File Downloader) that is not explicitly mentioned in the question but is related to the final action of the attack sequence. However, since the question asks if it's likely that the attacker used CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker and launch a malicious script before the final JavaScript downloader, the question does not require the final step to be included in the answer.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the related TTPs, it's likely that the attacker used CMSTP.exe to bypass AppLocker and launch a malicious script before the final JavaScript downloader.
