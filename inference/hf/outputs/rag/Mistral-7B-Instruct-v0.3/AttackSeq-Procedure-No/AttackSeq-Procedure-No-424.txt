 Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question is asking if it's likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, following initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- The related TTPs suggest that the attack sequence involves Initial Access (Tactic) and Spearphishing Attachment (Technique). This indicates that the attacker has gained access to the system through a phishing email with an attached malicious file.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks about the execution of a COM object, system information gathering, and downloading Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- COM object execution (T1055) is often used by malware to perform actions on the system, so it's plausible that a COM object could be used after initial access.
- System information gathering (T1082) is a common tactic used by malware to learn more about the compromised system, so it's also plausible that this would occur after initial access.
- Downloading malware (T1098) is a common tactic used by malware to install additional components or updates. In this case, the malware in question is Ursnif and GandCrab, which are known to be distributed together.
- The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is: Initial Access (T1566.001) -> COM object execution (T1055) -> System information gathering (T1082) -> Downloading malware (T1098) with the malware being Ursnif and GandCrab.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it's likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, following initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
- Based on the related TTPs, it's plausible that a COM object could be used to perform actions on the system (T1055), gather system information (T1082), and download additional malware (T1098).
- The malware in question, Ursnif and GandCrab, are often distributed together, so it's likely that they would be downloaded in the same sequence.
- Final Answer: Yes (Answer Choice A).
