 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the use of PDQ Deploy by the GreyEnergy group after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate the use of Discovery (T1018) and Lateral Movement (T1570) techniques, but there is no mention of Software Deployment Tools (T1072) or PDQ Deploy specifically.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of PDQ Deploy, but the related TTPs do not indicate the use of this tool. The GreyEnergy group is known to use tools like Cobalt Strike, PowerShell, and PsExec for lateral movement and payload deployment, not PDQ Deploy.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a computer and mapping the network, would likely use lateral movement techniques like T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) to move across the network. However, the question asks about the use of PDQ Deploy, which is not a tool typically associated with the GreyEnergy group's TTPs. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No, the GreyEnergy group will not use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
