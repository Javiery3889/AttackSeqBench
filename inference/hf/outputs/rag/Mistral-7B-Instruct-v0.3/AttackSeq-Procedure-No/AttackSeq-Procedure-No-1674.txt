 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would use Kerberos ticket attacks for lateral movement before conducting reconnaissance of the card processing service, given that they have already compromised the bank's Enterprise Admin account and leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network for privilege escalation.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have the capability to perform lateral movement using Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) and Kerberoasting (T1558.003) techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after privilege escalation and account compromise. The attackers, having gained high-level access, would likely use their privileges to move laterally within the network to access other systems. The Pass the Ticket technique allows an attacker to impersonate another user without needing their credentials, making it a suitable method for lateral movement. Kerberoasting, on the other hand, is a technique used to extract NTLM hashes from Kerberos tickets, which can be used for further attacks. However, it is not typically used for lateral movement but rather for credential harvesting. In this case, the attackers have already compromised the Enterprise Admin account, so they would not need to use Kerberoasting for credential access. Instead, they would likely use Pass the Ticket for lateral movement before conducting reconnaissance of the card processing service.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers have compromised the Enterprise Admin account and leveraged control weaknesses for privilege escalation.
   - To move laterally within the network, they would likely use the Pass the Ticket technique (T1550.003) to impersonate other users without needing their credentials.
   - Kerberoasting (T1558.003) is a technique used for credential harvesting, and since the attackers already have the Enterprise Admin account, they would not need to use Kerberoasting for credential access at this stage.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers would use Kerberos ticket attacks (Pass the Ticket) for lateral movement before conducting reconnaissance of the card processing service.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
