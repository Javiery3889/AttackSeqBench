 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that ProjectM actors are involved in reconnaissance activities, specifically determining physical locations (T1591.001) and searching open websites/domains (T1593). Additionally, they have been identified as developing resources, such as domains (T1583.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after reconnaissance. The TTPs related to the question suggest that ProjectM actors first conduct reconnaissance to identify targets (T1591.001 and T1593), and then develop resources, such as phishing sites (T1583.001). Collecting location information from visitors to these phishing sites (T1087.001) would be a logical next step before executing malware like Crimson and Peppy (T1055).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
   - The related TTPs suggest that ProjectM actors first conduct reconnaissance to identify targets and then develop resources, such as phishing sites.
   - Collecting location information from visitors to these phishing sites would be a logical next step before executing malware like Crimson and Peppy.
   - Therefore, it is likely that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
