 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing reconnaissance (T1596.005-Scan Databases) and discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery) activities. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is looking for information or resources on the network. The technique T1530-Data from Cloud Storage is not directly related to the question but could be used in a broader context for further reconnaissance.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of Shodan and Censys, which are tools used for discovery (T1046) of publicly available resources. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the attacker would use these tools to discover more resources in the medical networks, as they are commonly used for this purpose.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
