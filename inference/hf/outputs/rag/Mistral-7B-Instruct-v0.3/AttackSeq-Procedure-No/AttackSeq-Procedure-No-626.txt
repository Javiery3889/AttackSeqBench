 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling (T1572) for Command and Control, and that data exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041) is a possibility. However, there is no mention of exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols (T1048.003).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exfiltration over HTTPS, SMTPS, or a non-C2 protocol. The related TTPs suggest that the CostaRicto Campaign has established a C2 channel and may exfiltrate data over this channel, but there is no indication that they would use HTTPS, SMTPS, or a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration. Therefore, it is less likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has established a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The related TTPs suggest that data exfiltration over the C2 channel is a possibility (T1041), but there is no indication that they would use HTTPS, SMTPS, or a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
