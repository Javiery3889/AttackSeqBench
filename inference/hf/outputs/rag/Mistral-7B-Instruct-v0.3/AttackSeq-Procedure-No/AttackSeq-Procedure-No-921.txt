 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search for sensitive documents only before lateral movement via compromised systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that Gamaredon uses techniques for Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment), Defense Evasion (T1221-Template Injection), and Lateral Movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content). However, there is no mention of a specific TTP related to searching for sensitive documents before lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific action (searching for sensitive documents) that is not directly related to the TTPs provided. The TTPs provided suggest that Gamaredon's malware is capable of Initial Access, Defense Evasion, and Lateral Movement, but they do not necessarily imply that it will search for sensitive documents before lateral movement.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided question and related TTPs, it is not likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search for sensitive documents only before lateral movement via compromised systems. The malware may perform other actions such as Initial Access, Defense Evasion, and Lateral Movement, but the question specifically asks about searching for sensitive documents, which is not directly implied by the provided TTPs. Therefore, the answer is "No".
