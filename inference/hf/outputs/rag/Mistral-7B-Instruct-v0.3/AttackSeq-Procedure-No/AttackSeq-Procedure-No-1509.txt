 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials only after compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Carbanak group has been known to use Domain Accounts for Initial Access, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation. However, the TTPs do not directly mention the use of Cobalt Strike beacon for mapping the internal network or collecting administrative-level credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific sequence of events: compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials, using them to compromise additional endpoints, and then using Cobalt Strike beacon for mapping and credential collection. The related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they focus on the use of Domain Accounts but do not mention Cobalt Strike beacon.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that the Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials only after compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
