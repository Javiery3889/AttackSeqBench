 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors after using active discovery methods for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the adversaries have already used phishing (T1566) for initial access into the targeted network. However, they have also used active discovery methods (T1589) and phishing for information gathering (T1598) as part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the adversaries have already used phishing for initial access, it is unlikely that they would initiate another phishing campaign against electricity distributors immediately after. Instead, they would likely use the access they have already gained to perform further reconnaissance (T1589 and T1598) to identify potential targets within the network before launching any additional attacks.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that the adversaries would not initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors immediately after using active discovery methods for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Instead, they would likely use the access they have already gained to perform further reconnaissance before launching any additional attacks. Therefore, the answer is "No".
