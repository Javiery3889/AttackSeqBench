 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra (a known threat actor) will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, after they have developed Bankshot implants for full control and file wiping.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques for Execution (T1203) and Initial Access (T1566.001). T1203 is related to exploitation, which aligns with the use of a malicious Word document to exploit CVE-2018-4878. T1566.001 is related to spear phishing attachments, which aligns with the method of delivering the malicious Word document.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the development of Bankshot implants, which is a tactic under Resource Development. However, the question does not mention any other tactics or techniques that would contradict the use of spear phishing emails and exploitation for initial access. Therefore, the sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is:
   - Initial Access (T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment)
   - Execution (T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution)

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, followed by the use of Bankshot implants for further control and file wiping. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
