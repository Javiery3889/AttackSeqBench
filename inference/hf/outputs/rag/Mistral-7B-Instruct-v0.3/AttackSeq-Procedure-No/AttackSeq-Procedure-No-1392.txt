 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 (a known advanced persistent threat group) will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 is likely to perform Discovery (T1016, T1083) and Credential Access (T1555.006) activities.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP T1555.006 specifically mentions Cloud Secrets Management Stores, which includes AWS Secrets Manager. Retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager is a form of Credential Access. The TTP T1083 refers to File and Directory Discovery, which could include gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. However, T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) is not directly related to the enumeration of network and host configurations using native OS binaries.
4. Conclusion: Given that FIN13 is known to perform Credential Access and Discovery activities, it is likely that they would first retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager (Credential Access) and then gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance (Discovery). Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
