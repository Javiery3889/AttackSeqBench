 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries manipulate memory and processes to evade detection after transmitting data over HTTP/HTTPS.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the adversaries are using Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) and Web Protocols (Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols) for communication. However, there is no mention of Defense Evasion techniques like Process Injection (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055) in the question or related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the adversaries manipulating memory and processes to evade detection using functions like 'ZwProtectVirtualMemory' and 'ZwMapViewOfSection'. The related TTPs only indicate the use of web protocols for command and control, which does not necessarily imply the use of these specific defense evasion techniques.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the adversaries manipulate memory and processes to evade detection using functions like 'ZwProtectVirtualMemory' and 'ZwMapViewOfSection' only after transmitting data over HTTP/HTTPS. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
