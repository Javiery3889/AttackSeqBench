 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the IEXPL0RE RAT, after communicating with the C2 server, will record keystrokes and exfiltrate data such as passwords.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the focus is on Exfiltration (Tactic) and the technique used is T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves sending stolen data back to the attacker's C2 server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the collection of keystrokes and passwords, which are types of data that could be exfiltrated. The IEXPL0RE RAT is a known RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that is capable of keylogging and data theft. Given that it has already communicated with the C2 server, it is likely that it will perform its collection activities, including recording keystrokes and exfiltrating data such as passwords.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1086 - PowerShell: The IEXPL0RE RAT may have been installed using PowerShell.
   - T1055 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: The RAT communicates with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods.
   - T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: After receiving instructions, the RAT records keystrokes and exfiltrates data such as passwords.
