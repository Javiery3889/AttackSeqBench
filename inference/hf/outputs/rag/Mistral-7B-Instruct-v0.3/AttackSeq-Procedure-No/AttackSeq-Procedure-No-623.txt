 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to use tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning after employing PowerShell injection techniques.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery, which suggests that network service scanning is a part of the CostaRicto Campaign's tactics. However, there is no mention of pscan or nmap, which are specific tools for network service scanning.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after PowerShell injection. The TTPs do not suggest that CostaRicto Campaign uses pscan or nmap after PowerShell injection. Instead, the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection is related to the PowerShell injection technique mentioned in the question. The SombRAT backdoor is used for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, which are part of the Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1086. However, there is no indication that network service scanning with pscan or nmap is part of the sequence after PowerShell injection.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the CostaRicto Campaign uses tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning after employing PowerShell injection techniques and before using the SombRAT backdoor for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. Therefore, the answer is "No".
