 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Initial Access tactics and the Spearphishing Attachment technique. However, they do not mention the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 or any other FortiOS-specific vulnerabilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) in FortiOS devices. The related TTPs do not provide any indication that this vulnerability is being used in the attack sequence. The Spearphishing Attachment technique is used for initial access, but it does not necessarily imply the use of a specific exploit like CVE-2018-13379.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
