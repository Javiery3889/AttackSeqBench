 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware was initially delivered via a phishing email and downloaded using VBScript. The Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.003-Cron suggests that the malware may use the cron utility for persistence, but it does not necessarily mean that it will use the cron utility for further execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the malware's behavior for further execution, not persistence. The TTPs related to the malware's execution (T1204.002-Malicious File) suggest that it was initially downloaded and opened as a .doc file, which is more likely to be executed using PowerShell or another scripting language common in Microsoft environments, rather than the cron utility, which is typically used in Unix/Linux systems.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware will use PowerShell or another scripting language for further execution, not the cron utility. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
