 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: T1059.001 is the technique "PowerShell" which is used to execute scripts on a system. This technique does not inherently involve Telnet or njRAT.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the execution of a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1) after an obfuscated batch script. However, the related TTPs do not suggest a sequence of events that would lead to Telnet communication instead of njRAT. The use of PowerShell does not necessarily imply the use of Telnet or a change from njRAT to Telnet for command and control.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is not likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
