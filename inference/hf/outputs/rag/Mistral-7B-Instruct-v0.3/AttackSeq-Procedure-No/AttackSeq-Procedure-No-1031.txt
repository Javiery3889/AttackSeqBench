 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information after using tools for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Discovery (T1018-Remote System Discovery) and Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the network and its resources.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. After achieving lateral movement within the network, it is common for attackers to perform Discovery (T1018) to gather information about the network and its resources, which includes Active Directory and other network details. The use of tools like ADFind and port scanning falls under this Discovery TTP.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process after using tools for lateral movement. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
