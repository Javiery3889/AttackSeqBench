 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the APT28 threat actor will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after leveraging a specific sequence of TTPs, which includes using a malicious Word document to gain initial access, DDE technique, and Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands to download a file.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided do not explicitly mention the use of a malicious Word document, DDE technique, or Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands to download a file. However, they do mention the use of Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) and PowerShell (T1059.001) for execution, and the use of a batch file and registry entry for persistence (implied by the question).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific sequence of TTPs, but the related TTPs do not align with that sequence. The question includes TTPs that are not present in the related TTPs, such as the use of a malicious Word document and DDE technique. Therefore, it is unlikely that the APT28 threat actor will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after the specified sequence of TTPs.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". The APT28 threat actor is not likely to create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after leveraging the specified sequence of TTPs, which includes using a malicious Word document to gain initial access, DDE technique, and Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands to download a file.
