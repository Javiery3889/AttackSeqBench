 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the likelihood of Stuxnet using FTP protocol for C2 communication after exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on lateral movement (T1210) and exploitation of remote services (T1071.002). Stuxnet is known to use several methods for C2 communication, but FTP is not one of them.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Stuxnet is a highly sophisticated malware known for its use of several C2 methods, including IRCD, SMB, and HTTP. However, it does not typically use FTP for C2 communication. The question asks about the likelihood of this happening, and given the known behavior of Stuxnet, it is unlikely that it would use FTP for C2 communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - Stuxnet is known to use several C2 methods, but FTP is not one of them.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Stuxnet will use FTP protocol for C2 communication to send system information and receive commands or updates after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
