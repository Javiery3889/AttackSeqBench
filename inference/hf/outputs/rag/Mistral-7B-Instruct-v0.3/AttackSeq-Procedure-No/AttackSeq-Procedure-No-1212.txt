 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Turla, after running malware in memory, will change the default program association in the registry and use a modified PowerShell profile for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Turla is known to use techniques for Persistence (T1546) and specifically mentions changing default file associations (T1546.001) and using PowerShell profiles (T1546.013).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Turla's actions after running malware in memory, which is part of the execution phase. The related TTPs suggest that Turla is likely to establish persistence on the compromised system, which aligns with changing the default file association and using a PowerShell profile. Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the question and the related TTPs is "Yes".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Turla will change the default program association and use a modified PowerShell profile for persistence after running malware in memory.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Turla is known to use techniques for Persistence (T1546) and specifically mentions changing default file associations (T1546.001) and using PowerShell profiles (T1546.013).
   - Given that Turla is known to use these techniques for persistence, it is likely that they will change the default program association and use a modified PowerShell profile for persistence after running malware in memory.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
