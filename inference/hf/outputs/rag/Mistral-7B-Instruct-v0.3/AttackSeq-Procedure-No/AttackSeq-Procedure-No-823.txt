 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if TG-3279 will gain initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' after compromising infrastructure by cloning domain registration information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing reconnaissance (T1596 and T1595) and potentially using valid accounts (T1078) for initial access. However, there is no mention of cloning domain registration information or exploiting targets with 's' and 'rdp_crk' as part of the initial access phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the attacker first compromises infrastructure (cloning domain registration information) and then gains initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk'. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence. Instead, they suggest that the attacker might perform reconnaissance and potentially use valid accounts for initial access, but there is no indication of cloning domain registration information or exploiting targets with 's' and 'rdp_crk' as part of the initial access phase.

Therefore, it is unlikely that TG-3279 will gain initial access using tools like 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets only after compromising infrastructure by cloning domain registration information.
