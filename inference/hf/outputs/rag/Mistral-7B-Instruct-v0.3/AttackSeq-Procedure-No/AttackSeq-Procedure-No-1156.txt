 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing their passwords, given that they have collected victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are related to reconnaissance (gathering information), resource development (creating accounts), and impact (disabling services or data). However, there is no TTP related to stopping specific services before changing passwords.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs provided do not suggest that the attackers will stop specific services before changing the passwords. The TTPs indicate that the attackers are gathering credentials (T1589.001) and creating email accounts (T1586.002), which are typically used for further communication or to send phishing emails. The TTP T1489 (Service Stop) is related to impact, but it does not necessarily imply that the attackers will stop services before changing passwords.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided question and related TTPs, it is not likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing their passwords. Therefore, the answer is "No".
