 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if SkinnyBoy sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request only before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that SkinnyBoy is performing Discovery activities (T1082 and T1083) and Exfiltration (T1041). However, T1041 does not specify the use of an HTTP POST request or the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding during the initial exfiltration phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a specific sequence of events: discovery, exfiltration, and then encoding. However, the related TTPs do not indicate that the exfiltration step necessarily involves an HTTP POST request or the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding. Therefore, it is more likely that the discovery and exfiltration steps occur first, and the encoding step may follow later.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that SkinnyBoy sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request only before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding. This sequence of TTPs does not align with the information provided in the question and related TTPs.
