 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group, after using compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement on the network, collected information about users, network settings, and processes using utilities like net user and tasklist.exe for discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery tactics, specifically T1087.001-Local Account and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the system, including user accounts and processes.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question and the related TTPs both point towards the collection of information about the system, which includes users, network settings, and processes. The utilities net user and tasklist.exe are commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, it is plausible that the Lazarus Group would use these utilities for discovery after lateral movement.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Lazarus Group collected information about users, network settings, and processes using utilities like net user and tasklist.exe for discovery. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
