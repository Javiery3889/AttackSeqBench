 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FIN13 (a known threat group) is likely to gather information on services after moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells, and if they do so only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 is known to use Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1556-Modify Authentication Process, and Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory. These TTPs suggest that FIN13 is interested in obtaining credentials, not necessarily gathering information on services.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 first moves laterally, then gathers service information, and finally obtains credentials. However, the related TTPs indicate that FIN13 primarily focuses on credential access, not service discovery. Therefore, it is less likely that FIN13 would gather service information after obtaining credentials.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that FIN13 would first obtain credentials and then move laterally, rather than gathering service information after obtaining credentials. Therefore, the answer is "No".
