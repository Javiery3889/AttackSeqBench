 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Lazarus group, after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, is likely to collect data from removable media devices before exfiltrating it through a covert channel.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Collection (T1025) focusing on Data from Removable Media. However, there is no mention of the Tactic of Exfiltration (T1041) or any specific technique related to a custom tunneling tool.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs only mention the Collection tactic. The Exfiltration tactic and the use of a custom tunneling tool are not mentioned in the question or the related TTPs. Therefore, it is less likely that the Lazarus group would collect data from removable media devices and then exfiltrate it through a custom tunneling tool after lateral movement.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include collecting data from removable media devices before exfiltrating it through a custom tunneling tool. Therefore, the answer is "No".
