 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Shuckworm is likely to deploy software like GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Shuckworm uses Web Protocols (T1071.001) for Command and Control, and it also uses Protocol Tunneling (T1572). This suggests that Shuckworm may use tunneling techniques to hide its communication, which aligns with the use of the GOGETTER tunneler.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after HTTP requests to C&C servers. The use of HTTP requests (T1071.001) is consistent with the initial communication phase. The use of GOGETTER tunneler and Yamux TLS-based C2 channel (implied by the question) is a form of Protocol Tunneling (T1572), which is a related TTP. This sequence would allow Shuckworm to maintain a secure and hidden communication channel for further commands and payloads.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events after HTTP requests to C&C servers.
   - Shuckworm uses HTTP requests (T1071.001) for initial communication.
   - The related TTPs suggest that Shuckworm may use tunneling techniques (T1572).
   - The question also mentions the use of GOGETTER tunneler and Yamux TLS-based C2 channel, which is a form of tunneling.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Shuckworm would deploy software like GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
