 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that lightSpy malware, after performing exfiltration and updates via its main control module, will target data collection from various sources such as hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in exfiltration (T1041) and data collection (T1213). T1213 specifically mentions data from information repositories, which could include the types of data mentioned in the question (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about data collection after exfiltration, which aligns with T1213 (Data from Information Repositories). The types of data mentioned in the question (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data) are all types of data that could be found in information repositories. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for exfiltrating data and updates via the main control module.
   - T1213 (Data from Information Repositories) for collecting data from various sources such as hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if lightSpy malware, after performing exfiltration and updates via its main control module, will target data collection from various sources.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in exfiltration (T1041) and data collection (T1213).
   - T1213 specifically mentions data from information repositories, which could include the types of data mentioned in the question (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data).
   - Therefore, it is likely that lightSpy malware will first perform data collection by targeting the mentioned data sources.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
