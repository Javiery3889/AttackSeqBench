 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase, given that information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data were collected during the Discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are all Discovery techniques, which involve gathering information about the target system or network. There are no Command and Control techniques mentioned, and FTP (T1071.002) is a Command and Control technique that involves file transfer.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since the question is asking about the Command and Control phase and the related TTPs do not suggest any Command and Control activities, it is unlikely that the malware will initiate download via FTP at this stage. The collection of information during the Discovery phase does not necessarily imply that a specific Command and Control technique like FTP will be used.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the Command and Control phase, but the related TTPs only involve Discovery techniques.
   - FTP (T1071.002) is a Command and Control technique, and it is not likely to be used immediately after the Discovery phase, especially without any indication in the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, the malware is not likely to initiate download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase. Final Answer: B: No.
