 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel before the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Command and Control (T1573) and Exfiltration (T1041). However, the TTP T1573.002 specifically mentions the use of Asymmetric Cryptography, which typically refers to the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the related TTPs suggest the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication before any data exfiltration, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel before these secure communication methods are established.

Therefore, the answer is No. The SombRAT backdoor is not likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel before the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
