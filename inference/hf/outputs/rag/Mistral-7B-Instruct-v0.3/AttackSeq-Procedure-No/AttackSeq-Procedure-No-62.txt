 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Grandoreiro to enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, after creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic being discussed is Persistence (T1547) and the Technique used is T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. However, there is no mention of Discovery (T1087) or Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580) in the question or related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Since the question does not provide any information about Grandoreiro enumerating AWS infrastructure, and the related TTPs do not suggest this activity, it is unlikely that Grandoreiro would enumerate AWS infrastructure before communicating with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Grandoreiro is likely to enumerate AWS infrastructure after creating a .LNK file for persistence.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that Grandoreiro performs Discovery or Cloud Infrastructure Discovery.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Grandoreiro would enumerate AWS infrastructure before communicating with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK.
   - Final Answer: No.
