 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development after using fake social media personas and stealing data from social media mobile apps.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using social media accounts for resource development (T1585.001 and T1586.001), and also for reconnaissance (T1593.001). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the victims, which is a common precursor to target development.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". Given the TTPs provided, it is more likely that the attacker would proceed to the next step in the attack chain, which is target development. This would involve accessing external victim-owned websites to gather more information about the targets. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

In summary, the attacker has already used social media accounts for resource development and reconnaissance, and it is likely that they will continue to the next step in the attack chain, which is target development, by accessing external victim-owned websites.
