 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the tactics of Exfiltration and the techniques T1029 (Scheduled Transfer) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that FamousSparrow uses a scheduled transfer method for exfiltration, which aligns with Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer. Additionally, the question states that the data transfer is done over the C2 channel, which is similar to Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. The question also mentions that FamousSparrow communicates with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and employs multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control. While these TTPs are not explicitly mentioned in the answer choices, they are consistent with the behavior of a threat actor that uses scheduled transfers and exfiltrates data over the C2 channel. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that FamousSparrow would also exfiltrate data every 10 minutes using this method.
4. Conclusion: Based on the question and related TTPs, it is most plausible that FamousSparrow does exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
