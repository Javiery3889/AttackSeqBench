 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker's focus is on data destruction (Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction) and defense evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers, which suggests that the attacker is in a reconnaissance or command-and-control phase. The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are data destruction tools, and their deployment would typically occur later in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has achieved their objectives and is preparing to cover their tracks or escalate their attack. Therefore, it is less likely that Agrius would deploy these tools before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker's focus is on data destruction and defense evasion.
   - The 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 servers suggests that the attacker is in a reconnaissance or command-and-control phase.
   - Deploying 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' malware would typically occur later in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has achieved their objectives and is preparing to cover their tracks or escalate their attack.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that Agrius would deploy these tools before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
   - Final Answer: No.
