 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Reconnaissance tactic and the Credentials technique (T1589.001). This technique is used to gather user credentials, which is a common method for maintaining access to a compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, which is often exploited for initial access. After gaining initial access, it is more likely for the attackers to harvest user credentials to maintain access rather than relying on phishing domains, especially if they have already gained a foothold in the network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. Given the related TTPs and the context of the question, it is more likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials (Answer A) as it aligns better with the attack sequence described in the question. The attackers have already gained initial access, so they would likely use this opportunity to gather credentials for further access and movement within the network, rather than relying on phishing domains.
