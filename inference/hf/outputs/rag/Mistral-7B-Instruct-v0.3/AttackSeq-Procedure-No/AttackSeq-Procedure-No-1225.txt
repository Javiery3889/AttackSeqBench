 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if T9000 is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1123-Audio Capture (Collection tactic), T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (Privilege Escalation and Persistence tactics). However, there is no mention of T1547.001 being used for injecting a specific DLL into explorer.exe.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about T9000 establishing persistence, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about T9000 injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe. Therefore, it is unlikely that T9000 would perform this action.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about T9000 establishing persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - The related TTPs do not provide any information about T9000 injecting a specific DLL into explorer.exe.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that T9000 would perform this action, and the answer is B: No.
