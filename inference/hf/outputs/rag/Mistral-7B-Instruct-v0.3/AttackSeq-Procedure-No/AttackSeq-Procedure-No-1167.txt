 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance after spear-phishing campaigns and hosting watering hole sites.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains, which is a reconnaissance technique. This suggests that the actors may have performed reconnaissance after the initial access phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - Initial Access: T1189-Drive-by Compromise (delivering payloads through spear-phishing campaigns and watering hole sites)
   - Reconnaissance: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains (identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains)

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
