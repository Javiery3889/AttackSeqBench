 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT42 will conduct reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) through spear-phishing (T1598.001) and surveillance operations only after utilizing virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques (Tactic: Defense Evasion).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT42 has already performed Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access) through Phishing (T1566) and Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) through Credential Harvesting (T1589.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if APT42 will conduct reconnaissance after using virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques. However, the related TTPs show that APT42 has already performed Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) before the Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access). Therefore, it is not necessary for them to conduct reconnaissance again after using virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that APT42 will conduct reconnaissance through spear-phishing and surveillance operations only after utilizing virtualization or sandbox evasion techniques for defense evasion. The answer is "No".
