 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the actors have gathered network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems.
2. The related TTPs mention Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory, which is a method used to extract credentials from the memory of a system, often using tools like Mimikatz.
3. The question also mentions Impacket's atexec tool, which is a technique used for executing commands on remote systems, often as part of lateral movement. However, it's not directly related to credential dumping.
4. Webshells, mentioned in the question, are often used for maintaining persistence and lateral movement within a network.
5. Given the sequence of events described in the question (gathering network information, credential dumping, using a tool for remote command execution, and using webshells for lateral movement), it's plausible that the actors first dumped credentials with a Mimikatz variant, then used Impacket's atexec tool for remote command execution, and finally used webshells for lateral movement.
6. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
