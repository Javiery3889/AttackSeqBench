 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attacker has gained initial access through phishing attacks and fake news organizations. This is not directly related to log clearing or obfuscation techniques.
2. The related TTPs provided mention Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information and T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs. These TTPs suggest that the attacker may attempt to evade detection by obfuscating files and clearing system logs.
3. T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is a technique used to make files or information unreadable to analysis tools, making it difficult to understand the purpose of the file or the actions it performs.
4. T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs is a technique used to remove evidence of an attacker's presence or actions from system logs.
5. Packrat is known for employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses (as per the question). These techniques align with the Defense Evasion tactics mentioned in the related TTPs.
6. Clearing logs before employing obfuscation techniques makes sense as it reduces the chances of the attacker's actions being traced back to them.
7. Therefore, it is likely that Packrat will clear logs from /var/logs and /Library/logs during execution before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.
