 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the INOCNATION campaign gains initial access and executes a malicious DLL payload with anti-behavioral analysis techniques. This suggests that the attackers are trying to avoid detection at this stage.
2. The related TTPs list Defense Evasion as a tactic, specifically T1622-Debugger Evasion. This technique is used to evade detection by debuggers, which aligns with the anti-behavioral analysis techniques mentioned in the question.
3. The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use Debugger Evasion tactics before establishing command and control. Given the initial access and malicious DLL execution, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would want to ensure their presence remains hidden before establishing a connection.
4. The question also mentions that the command and control could be established through encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections with additional XOR encoding. This is not directly related to Debugger Evasion but is a common tactic for maintaining communication while hiding the content of the data being transmitted. However, it is not uncommon for attackers to use multiple tactics in a single attack sequence, so it is plausible that Debugger Evasion would occur before this step.
5. Therefore, based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that the INOCNATION campaign will use Debugger Evasion tactics, such as the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function or checking system flags and CPU registers, before establishing command and control through encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections with additional XOR encoding.
