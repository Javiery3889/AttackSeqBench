 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques related to Exfiltration, specifically T1567.002 (Exfiltration to Cloud Storage), T1020 (Automated Exfiltration), and T1567 (Exfiltration Over Web Service).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where data is first exfiltrated over Google Drive, then GoLang-based file recon plugins are used to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases. However, the related TTPs do not indicate a specific order of these techniques.

   - T1567.002 (Exfiltration to Cloud Storage) and T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) do not necessarily imply the use of a specific method for initial exfiltration. They could be used at any point during the exfiltration process.

   - T1567.002 (Exfiltration to Cloud Storage) suggests that the data is exfiltrated to a cloud storage service, but it does not specify Google Drive.

   - T1567 (Exfiltration Over Web Service) suggests that the data is exfiltrated over a web service, but it does not specify the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins.

   - GoLang-based file recon plugins (not a listed TTP) are typically used for reconnaissance or post-exploitation activities, such as discovering and exfiltrating sensitive files, rather than for the initial exfiltration of data.

Given this analysis, it is more likely that the attacker would first use techniques related to Exfiltration (T1567.002, T1020, or T1567) to exfiltrate data, and then use GoLang-based file recon plugins for further data collection or exfiltration, not necessarily in the sequence suggested in the question. Therefore, the answer is No.
