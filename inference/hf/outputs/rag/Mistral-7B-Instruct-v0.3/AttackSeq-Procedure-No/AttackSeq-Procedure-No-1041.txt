 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if POWERSHOWER (a technique used for system information gathering) will enter a communications loop with the C2 server only before collecting system information on the infected machine.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that POWERSHOWER is used for system information discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery) and exfiltration of data over the C2 channel (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests that POWERSHOWER will only communicate with the C2 server before collecting system information, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence. Instead, the TTPs suggest that POWERSHOWER is used for system information discovery first, followed by exfiltration of the collected data over the C2 channel. Therefore, it is more likely that POWERSHOWER will communicate with the C2 server after collecting system information, not before.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". POWERSHOWER is not likely to enter a communications loop with the C2 server only before collecting system information on the infected machine. Instead, it is more likely to communicate with the C2 server after collecting system information.
