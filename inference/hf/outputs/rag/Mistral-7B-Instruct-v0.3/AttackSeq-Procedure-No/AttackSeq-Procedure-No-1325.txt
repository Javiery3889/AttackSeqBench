 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely for Sayad malware to capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in data collection (T1560) and screen capture (T1113). However, there is no indication that the screen capture (T1113) is dependent on the discovery (T1087) of system and application details (T1085).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence where discovery is a prerequisite for screen capture. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The TTPs suggest that both discovery and screen capture are part of the data collection process, but there is no indication that one must occur before the other.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if it is likely for Sayad malware to capture screenshots after performing discovery. The related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they indicate that both discovery and screen capture are part of the data collection process but do not suggest a specific order. Therefore, it is not likely that Sayad malware would capture screenshots only after performing discovery. Final Answer: B: No.
