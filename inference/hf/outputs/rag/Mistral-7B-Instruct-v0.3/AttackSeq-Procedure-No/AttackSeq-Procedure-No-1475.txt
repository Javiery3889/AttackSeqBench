 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Seaduke, after communicating with the C&C server, will perform certain actions.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves data collection (T1560) and exfiltration (T1041).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Retrieving detailed bot/system information (T1086) and updating configurations (T1088) are likely to occur during the initial communication phase with the C&C server.
   - Uploading/downloading files (T1077) could be part of the communication process, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the question.
   - Securely deleting itself (T1070) is not a common behavior for botnets like Seaduke, as they typically maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Archiving collected data (T1560) and exfiltrating data via legitimate cloud services (T1041) are the actions that align best with the attack sequence described in the question, as they are both part of the related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Seaduke will utilize its payload to archive collected data and exfiltrate it via legitimate cloud services.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves data collection and exfiltration.
   - Based on this information, it is likely that Seaduke will utilize its payload to archive collected data and exfiltrate it via legitimate cloud services.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
