 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the actors will move laterally to other systems on the network by executing commands through Impacket's atexec tool and performing OS credential dumping using Mimikatz after achieving defense evasion with Dumpert.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory and Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping. These TTPs suggest that the attackers are interested in obtaining credentials, but they do not necessarily imply that the attackers will move laterally or use Impacket's atexec tool.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a specific sequence of TTPs: Defense Evasion (Dumpert) -> Lateral Movement (Impacket's atexec) -> Credential Access (Mimikatz). However, the related TTPs do not indicate that the attackers will use Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. Instead, they focus on credential access techniques. Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers will move laterally to other systems on the network by executing commands through Impacket's atexec tool only before performing OS credential dumping using Mimikatz.

4. Conclusion: Final Answer: No. The sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with the attack sequence that would be most plausible based on the provided related TTPs. The attackers are more likely to focus on credential access techniques, such as T1003.001-LSASS Memory or T1003-OS Credential Dumping, rather than using Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement.
