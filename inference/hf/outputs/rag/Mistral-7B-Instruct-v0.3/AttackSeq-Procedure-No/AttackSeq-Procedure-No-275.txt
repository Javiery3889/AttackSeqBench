 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages. The TTPs related to this question include T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) and T1571 (Non-Standard Port).

2. T1041 is the technique used for exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the initial data exfiltration described in the question.

3. After exfiltrating data, the attacker may want to communicate with the C&C server to receive further instructions or report the success of the data exfiltration. This communication is typically done using a specific protocol, which could be non-standard (T1571) to evade detection.

4. The question also mentions that the communication might occur over non-standard ports. This is a common technique used to avoid detection by network security systems that are configured to monitor standard ports.

5. The question further specifies that the attacker might collect metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives before communicating with the C&C server. While this is not explicitly stated in the related TTPs, it is a common practice for an attacker to gather as much information as possible before communicating with the C&C server.

6. Therefore, it is plausible that after performing data exfiltration, Korplug would communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports only after collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in answer choice A.
