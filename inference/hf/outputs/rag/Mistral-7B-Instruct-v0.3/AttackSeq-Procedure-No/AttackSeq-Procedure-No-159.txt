 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance after identifying systems of interest and using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the target environment. Specifically, T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1046-Network Service Discovery are techniques under this tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involves identifying systems of interest, launching remote command execution scripts, and staging data in multi-part archives. This sequence is similar to the initial stages of an attack, where an attacker would gather information about the target environment to plan further actions. The related TTPs, T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1046-Network Service Discovery, are techniques used for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the next logical step after the initial stages of an attack.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
