 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about Dexphot's potential actions after using SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for defense evasion.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Persistence and the Technique of Scheduled Task (T1053.005).
3. The Tactic of Persistence is about maintaining access to a compromised system over time, and the Technique of Scheduled Task involves creating scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a later time.
4. The question asks if Dexphot is likely to ensure persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks. The use of Scheduled Task aligns with this description, as it allows for the execution of malicious code at a later time, ensuring persistence on the compromised system.
5. The Technique of Signed Binary Proxy Execution (T1053.005) is also mentioned in the related TTPs, but it involves using a legitimate binary to proxy the execution of malicious code. While this technique could be used for persistence, it does not necessarily have to be the first step after defense evasion.
6. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is more plausible that Dexphot would first ensure persistence through the use of Scheduled Tasks before employing other techniques like Signed Binary Proxy Execution.
