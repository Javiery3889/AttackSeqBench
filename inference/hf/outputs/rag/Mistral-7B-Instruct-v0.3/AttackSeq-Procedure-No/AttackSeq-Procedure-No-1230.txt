 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group, after establishing command and control communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), engaged in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the tactics of Exfiltration and Impact, with the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel for exfiltration and T1657-Financial Theft for the Impact tactic. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is exfiltrating data and potentially stealing funds, but they do not necessarily indicate that the attacker will encrypt the exfiltrated data.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about double-extortion ransomware, which involves both exfiltration and encryption of data. While the related TTPs indicate exfiltration, they do not provide evidence of encryption. Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the question and the provided TTPs is "No".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware after establishing command and control communication.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is exfiltrating data but do not indicate encryption.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware, as they have only exfiltrated data but not encrypted it.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
