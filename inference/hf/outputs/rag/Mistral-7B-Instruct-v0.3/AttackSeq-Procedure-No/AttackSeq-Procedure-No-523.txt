 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file, which is a common method for initial access (T1192 - Exploit Public-Facing Application). This initial access allows the attacker to execute code on the target system.
2. The question then states that a PowerShell script (fmx.ps1) will be executed. This aligns with the T1059.001 technique, which involves the use of PowerShell for command and scripting attack.
3. The question further describes the download of a zip file containing components for the malware payload. This is a common technique for attackers to download additional tools or stages of the malware (T1106 - Download Malware).
4. The question also mentions the decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'. This is a form of obfuscation (T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) to evade detection.
5. Given the sequence of events described in the question, it is likely that the attacker will first download the zip file containing the malware components, then decode and execute the base64 encoded script from 'sdmc.jpg'. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is A: Yes.
