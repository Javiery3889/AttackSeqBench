 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access. The question specifically mentions the 'Agrius' threat actor and the use of CVE-2018-13379, a vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Gateway.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Initial Access (T1190) and Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001). However, there is no mention of 'pass the ticket' or 'IPsec Helper' backdoor in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about Agrius using 'pass the ticket' for lateral movement or 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. The question only mentions the initial access via exploiting a public-facing application. Therefore, it is unlikely that Agrius would use 'pass the ticket' for lateral movement or 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP immediately after initial access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access: Agrius exploits a public-facing application (T1190) to gain access to the system.
   - Lateral Movement: After initial access, Agrius might use techniques like 'pass the ticket' for lateral movement, but this is not mentioned in the question or related TTPs.
   - Command and Control: It is possible that Agrius will establish communication with C2 servers at a later stage (T1071.001), but this is not the immediate action after initial access.
   - 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP: There is no information in the question or related TTPs that suggests Agrius uses 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

   Final Answer: B: No, Agrius is not likely to use pass the ticket for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.
