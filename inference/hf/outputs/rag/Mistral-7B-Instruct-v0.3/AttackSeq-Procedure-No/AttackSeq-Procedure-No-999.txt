 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Longhorn, a malware built for espionage, is likely to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the question is about the Discovery phase, specifically T1082 - System Information Discovery. However, the question also mentions defense evasion tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation, which are typically associated with the Command and Control (C2) and Defense Evasion phases, not Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where Longhorn first engages in exfiltration and system fingerprinting (Collection phase), then performs system information discovery (Discovery phase), and finally employs defense evasion tactics (C2 and Defense Evasion phases). However, the sequence proposed in the answer choices does not align with this suggested sequence. The answer choices do not propose the use of defense evasion tactics before system information discovery, which contradicts the question's context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if Longhorn is likely to perform system information discovery after employing defense evasion tactics. However, the sequence proposed in the answer choices does not align with the suggested sequence in the question. Therefore, the answer is B: No. Longhorn is not likely to use its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion.
