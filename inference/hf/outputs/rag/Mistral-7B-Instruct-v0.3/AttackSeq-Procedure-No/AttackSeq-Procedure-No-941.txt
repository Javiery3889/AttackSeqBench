 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SLUB malware will collect system information and capture screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server under the Discovery phase, after it has already exfiltrated the same data during the Exfiltration phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using the T1041 technique for exfiltration and the T1113 technique for screen capture. However, these TTPs are associated with the Exfiltration and Collection tactics, respectively, not the Discovery tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Discovery phase, but the TTPs provided are related to the Exfiltration and Collection phases. Since the malware has already performed these actions during the Exfiltration phase, it is unlikely that it will repeat these actions during the Discovery phase.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided question and related TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware will not collect system information and capture screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server under the Discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is "No".
