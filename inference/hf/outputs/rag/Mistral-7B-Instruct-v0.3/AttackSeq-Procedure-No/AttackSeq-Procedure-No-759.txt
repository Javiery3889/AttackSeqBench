 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the use of images in phishing emails after the attackers have verified victims' credentials and prompted for the 2-step verification code.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have initially accessed the victims through spearphishing links (T1566.002), developed email accounts (T1586.002), and conducted reconnaissance using spearphishing links (T1598.003). However, there is no indication that they have used images in phishing emails as a technique to evade security systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific action (using images in phishing emails) that is not mentioned in the related TTPs. The most plausible sequence of TTPs would not include the use of images in phishing emails at this stage, as the attackers have already gained access to the victims' accounts and are focusing on verifying their credentials and bypassing 2-step verification.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is B: No, the attackers will not use images instead of text in phishing emails at this stage of the attack sequence.
