 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication after a screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic being used is Collection (T1113-Screen Capture) and there is no mention of File Transfer Protocols (T1071.002) or any other C2 communication techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about C2 communication, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about C2 communication methods. However, the absence of T1071.002 (File Transfer Protocols) in the related TTPs suggests that it is less likely that FTP will be used for C2 communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Since the question asks about the use of FTP for C2 communication and the related TTPs do not indicate the use of FTP, it is more plausible that FTP will not be used. Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
