 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Tuyul malware will download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems, given that it has already exploited CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence (T1053) is involved, specifically the Technique T1053.003-Cron. This technique involves the use of cron jobs for maintaining persistence on a compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access. The TTPs related to the question suggest that the next logical step would be to establish persistence, which is exactly what the T1053.003-Cron technique does. Since the question mentions the downloading of a bash script named 'cron' for maintaining persistence, this aligns with the TTPs provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Tuyul malware will download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence (T1053) is involved, specifically the Technique T1053.003-Cron, which involves the use of cron jobs for maintaining persistence on a compromised system.
   - Given that the question mentions the downloading of a bash script named 'cron' for maintaining persistence, this aligns with the TTPs provided. Therefore, it is likely that the Tuyul malware will download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
