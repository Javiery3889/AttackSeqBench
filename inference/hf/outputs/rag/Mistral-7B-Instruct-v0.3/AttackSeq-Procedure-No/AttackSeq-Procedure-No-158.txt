 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by APT10 after initial access via spear phishing. The sequence in question is Wi-Fi Discovery, Brute-Force, and Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery (Discovery Tactic) and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access Tactic). These TTPs do not directly relate to Brute-Force or Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question (Wi-Fi Discovery, Brute-Force, and Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure for lateral movement) does not align with the Initial Access Tactic (Spearphishing Attachment) and the Discovery Tactic (Wi-Fi Discovery) provided in the related TTPs. APT10 is known for using spear phishing for initial access, but there is no evidence to suggest they perform a brute-force attack on Wi-Fi networks or leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement immediately after Wi-Fi Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by APT10 after initial access via spear phishing.
   - The related TTPs provided are T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery (Discovery Tactic) and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access Tactic).
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question (Wi-Fi Discovery, Brute-Force, and Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure for lateral movement) does not align with the Initial Access Tactic (Spearphishing Attachment) and the Discovery Tactic (Wi-Fi Discovery) provided in the related TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that APT10 would perform a brute-force attack on Wi-Fi networks or leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement immediately after Wi-Fi Discovery.
   - Final Answer: No.
