 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the Dropping Elephant backdoor evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack sequence involves Credential Access (T1555.003) to steal Google Chrome credentials and Execution (T1059.001) using PowerShell.
3. The Tactic of Defense Evasion (T1140) is also mentioned, which suggests that the attacker may use techniques to evade detection, such as decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts.
4. Given that the attack sequence involves stealing credentials and executing PowerShell scripts, it is plausible that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
5. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
