 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if PyFlash, after communicating with its hardcoded C&C server and using encryption, is likely to gather system information such as systeminfo, tasklist, and arp.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Discovery, specifically System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016) and System Information Discovery (T1082). These TTPs involve gathering information about the target system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that PyFlash is using encryption, which is a common technique for Command and Control (T1071). However, the question does not provide information about any other TTPs that would suggest an attacker is performing actions other than Discovery. Therefore, it is likely that PyFlash will gather system information as part of the Discovery phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question describes PyFlash communicating with its C&C server and using encryption, which are common TTPs for Command and Control. However, the related TTPs indicate that the attack is focused on Discovery. Since the question does not provide any information suggesting otherwise, it is likely that PyFlash will gather system information such as systeminfo, tasklist, and arp through the PyFlash backdoor as part of the Discovery phase. Final Answer: Yes.
