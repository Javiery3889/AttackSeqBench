 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks if it is likely that Blind Eagle, after initial access, will use a backdoor to store its configuration and ensure persistence through system startup.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1547) and the Technique of using Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001).
3. The Tactic of Persistence is about maintaining access to a compromised system over time, which aligns with the question's persistence requirement.
4. The Technique of using Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is a method for ensuring persistence by placing a script or executable in the Startup folder, which will run during system startup.
5. The question mentions the use of a VBScript in the Startup folder, which is consistent with the T1547.001 technique.
6. The question also mentions the use of a backdoor for defense evasion, but this is not directly related to the persistence technique mentioned in the TTPs. However, it is possible that the backdoor could be used for configuration storage, which would align with the question's requirement.
7. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is likely that Blind Eagle will use a backdoor for configuration storage and place a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence, making answer choice A the most plausible.
