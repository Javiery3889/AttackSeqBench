 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate to Google servers using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2) before exfiltrating data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding. This technique refers to the use of standard encoding schemes for data exfiltration, but it does not directly indicate the use of Jabber/XMPP for C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Rising Sun implant is not known to use Google servers for C2 communication, and it does not use the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2. The technique T1132.001-Standard Encoding is related to data exfiltration, not C2 communication. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate to Google servers using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 before exfiltrating data.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not the one described in answer choice A. Instead, the Rising Sun implant is more likely to perform initial reconnaissance, then establish a C2 connection using a different method (not Jabber/XMPP), and finally exfiltrate data using standard encoding (T1132.001-Standard Encoding). Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
