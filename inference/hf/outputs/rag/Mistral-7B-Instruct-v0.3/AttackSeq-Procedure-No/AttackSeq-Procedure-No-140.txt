 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an attack group would send spearphishing emails after attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack group is using spearphishing techniques (T1566.001 and T1566.002) for initial access, which aligns with the question's context.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the attack group first gathers user credentials through phishing domains (reconnaissance) and then sends spearphishing emails to gain initial access into victim networks. The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1566.001 and T1566.002 are both initial access techniques that can be used after reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question suggests a sequence of events where the attack group first gathers user credentials through phishing domains (reconnaissance) and then sends spearphishing emails to gain initial access into victim networks.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack group is using spearphishing techniques (T1566.001 and T1566.002) for initial access, which aligns with the question's context.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attack group would send spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold into victim networks before securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
