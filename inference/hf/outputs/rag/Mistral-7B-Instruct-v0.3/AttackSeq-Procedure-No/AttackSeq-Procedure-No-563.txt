 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol and subverting trust controls using T1553.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Command and Control (T1071) and Defense Evasion (T1553). However, T1057 Process Discovery is not explicitly mentioned as a related TTP, suggesting it may not be part of the immediate sequence following T1071 and T1553.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs do not suggest that T1057 Process Discovery is a likely step after T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1557 Subvert Trust Controls. Therefore, it is more plausible that T1057 Process Discovery is not part of the sequence in question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After utilizing subverted trust controls to evade defenses through T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, it is likely that the threat actors leveraged compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol. However, the question asks if it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that T1057 Process Discovery is a likely step after T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls. Therefore, it is more plausible that T1057 Process Discovery is not part of the sequence in question.
   - Final Answer: No.
