 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading. The question also mentions WMI checking for installed antivirus software.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (used for exploiting CVE-2017-11882), T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) (used for discovery of security software), and T1518.001-Security Software Discovery (used for discovering antivirus software).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not specify that WMI checks for installed antivirus software after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control. Instead, it asks about the sequence of events after exploitation and backdoor execution. The TTP T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation is related to discovering security software, which can happen at any point during the attack, not necessarily after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include WMI checking for installed antivirus software after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading.
   - The related TTP T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation is related to discovering security software, which can happen at any point during the attack, not necessarily after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, WMI checking for installed antivirus software does not necessarily occur after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.
   - Final Answer: No.
