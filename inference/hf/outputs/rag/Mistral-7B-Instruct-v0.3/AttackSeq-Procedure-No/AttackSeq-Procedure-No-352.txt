 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol, given that initial access was achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API, which involves the use of native API functions. This suggests that the malware may use native API functions during its execution. Additionally, the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32 is also mentioned, which is a technique used to load DLLs using Rundll32.exe, a Windows utility for executing DLLs. However, this technique does not necessarily exclude the use of native API functions.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the execution of specific native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before establishing command and control. The related TTP T1106-Native API suggests that the malware may indeed use native API functions during its execution. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will execute these specific native Windows functions before establishing command and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
   - The related TTP T1106-Native API suggests that the malware may use native API functions during its execution.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will execute these specific native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before establishing command and control.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
