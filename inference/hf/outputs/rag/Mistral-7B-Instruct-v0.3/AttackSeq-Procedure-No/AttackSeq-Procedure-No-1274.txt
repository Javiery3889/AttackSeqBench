 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers researched software code to enable supply-chain operations as part of the Reconnaissance phase before using the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software, which involves researching software code. This TTP is typically used in the early stages of an attack, such as the Reconnaissance phase. The TTP T1059.007-JavaScript, which involves using JavaScript for execution, is used later in the attack chain.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs suggest that the attackers would first research software code (Reconnaissance) before using JavaScript for execution (Execution). Therefore, it is more plausible that the attackers researched software code as part of the Reconnaissance phase before using the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "Yes". The attackers likely researched software code to enable supply-chain operations as part of the Reconnaissance phase before using the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.
