 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FIN13, after obtaining credentials, will delay execution of core functionality and then move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 has been known to use T1556 (Modify Authentication Process) for credential access. This technique often involves methods like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials. However, there is no direct mention of FIN13 delaying execution or using WMI or custom web shells in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of TTPs, and while the related TTPs do not explicitly mention the delay in execution or the use of WMI and custom web shells, these TTPs are often seen together in an attack sequence. For instance, after gaining credentials, an attacker might delay execution to avoid detection, then move laterally using WMI and custom web shells to spread within the network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if FIN13, after obtaining credentials, will delay execution and then move laterally using WMI and custom web shells.
   - While the related TTPs do not explicitly mention the delay in execution or the use of WMI and custom web shells, these TTPs are often seen together in an attack sequence.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that FIN13, after obtaining credentials, will delay execution and then move laterally using WMI and custom web shells.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
