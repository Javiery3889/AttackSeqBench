 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before the 'versioninfo.bat' script discovers system details and collects information for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves the use of the Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) for execution and File Deletion (T1070.004) for defense evasion. However, the TTPs do not suggest a specific sequence of events.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events where the 'stopedge.bat' script deletes files before the 'versioninfo.bat' script runs. However, the related TTPs do not provide enough information to support this sequence. The T1070.004 technique (File Deletion) is typically used to remove evidence of an attacker's presence or activities, not necessarily to evade detection before another script runs.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is more likely that the 'versioninfo.bat' script would run first to discover system details and collect information, and then the 'stopedge.bat' script could be used to delete files as a part of the attacker's post-exploitation activities, not as a means to evade detection before the 'versioninfo.bat' script runs. Therefore, the answer is No.
