 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would perform a series of actions after gaining initial access through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190), and the question mentions JavaScript (T1059.007) and cmd.exe (T1059.001) in the potential sequence of TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions the use of JavaScript and cmd.exe, which aligns with the TTPs T1059.007 (JavaScript) and T1059.001 (cmd.exe) under the Execution tactic. The question also mentions standing up websites containing malicious JavaScript and infecting victims via a fake software update, which could be part of the profiling and initial infection stages before installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes initial access, execution, and potential profiling and infection of victims.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting public-facing applications.
   - The question mentions the use of JavaScript and cmd.exe, which aligns with the TTPs T1059.007 (JavaScript) and T1059.001 (cmd.exe) under the Execution tactic.
   - Based on this information, it is likely that FamousSparrow would stand up websites containing malicious JavaScript to profile potential victims or infect them via a fake software update before using cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
