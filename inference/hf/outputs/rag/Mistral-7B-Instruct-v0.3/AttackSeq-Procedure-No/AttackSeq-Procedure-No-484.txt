 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if SparrowDoor, after gaining execution through remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications and running cmd.exe commands, will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent for Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Initial Access (T1190 and T1133) and Command and Control (T1205). However, there is no mention of modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific action (modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module) that is not related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, it is unlikely that this action would occur in the sequence described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if SparrowDoor will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent for Command and Control. Based on the related TTPs, there is no indication that this action would occur in the sequence described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
