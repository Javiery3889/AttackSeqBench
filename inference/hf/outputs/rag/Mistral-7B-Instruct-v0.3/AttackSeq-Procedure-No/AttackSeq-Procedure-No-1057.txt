 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that actions to maintain persistence will be performed after the execution of a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1) and the establishment of command and control by njRAT.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution, which is a common method for attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about maintaining persistence, and the related TTP involves the use of PowerShell for execution. It is likely that the attacker, having gained initial access and control, would want to ensure continued access to the system. One common method for this is to establish persistence, which can be achieved through various means, including PowerShell scripts. In this case, the attacker has already used PowerShell, so it is plausible that they would use it again for persistence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTP, it is likely that actions to maintain persistence will be performed after the steps mentioned, making the correct answer "Yes".
