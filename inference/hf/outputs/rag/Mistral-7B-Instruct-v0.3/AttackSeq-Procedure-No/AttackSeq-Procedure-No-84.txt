 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic, after compressing files with zlib for collection during the Collection tactic.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Collection tactic (T1560.002) and the Exfiltration tactic (T1030). However, there is no mention of file division as part of the Exfiltration tactic or any related technique (T1030).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific action (file division) during the Exfiltration tactic. Since the related TTPs do not mention this action, it is unlikely that Vyveva will perform this action as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic. Since the related TTPs do not mention file division as part of the Exfiltration tactic, the answer is B: No.
