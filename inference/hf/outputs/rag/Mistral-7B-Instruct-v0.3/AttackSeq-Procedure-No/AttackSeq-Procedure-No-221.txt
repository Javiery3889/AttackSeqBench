 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if a Shellbot, after establishing C&C communication by using an IRC channel, is likely to gather information about the infected host.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactic being discussed is Discovery (T1082). However, the specific technique within this tactic that involves gathering system information is T1087 - System Network Discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not mention any network discovery or scanning, but rather specific system information such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions. The technique T1087 does not cover these specific system information gathering methods.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The Shellbot, after establishing C&C communication, is not likely to gather the specified system information about the infected host (number of processor cores, type of processor, and presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions) as these are not typical actions associated with the Discovery tactic or the T1082-System Information Discovery technique. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
