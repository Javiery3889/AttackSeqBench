 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Iranian state-backed hackers scanned specific lists of target IP addresses after gaining initial access through phishing attacks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Reconnaissance techniques (T1591-Gather Victim Org Information and T1589.002-Email Addresses), and an Initial Access technique (T1566-Phishing). These TTPs suggest that the hackers have already gained access to the system and are gathering information about the victim organization and email addresses, but there is no mention of scanning specific IP addresses.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about scanning IP addresses, but the provided TTPs do not indicate this activity. The TTPs suggest that the hackers are focusing on gathering information about the victim organization and email addresses, which aligns more with the Reconnaissance phase rather than the Initial Access or Scanning phases. Therefore, it is less likely that they scanned specific lists of target IP addresses after gaining initial access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include scanning specific lists of target IP addresses. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
