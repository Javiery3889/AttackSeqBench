 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will enumerate domain users after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery tactics, specifically T1087.002-Domain Account, T1082-System Information Discovery, and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the system, including domain accounts, system information, and user information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about enumerating domain users, which aligns with T1087.002-Domain Account. After collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software (which could be considered system information, as per T1082), it is plausible that the attacker would then proceed to enumerate domain users (T1087.002).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Grandoreiro will enumerate domain users using AdFind after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
