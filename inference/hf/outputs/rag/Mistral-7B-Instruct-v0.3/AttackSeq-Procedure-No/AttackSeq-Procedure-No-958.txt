 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will enumerate Active Directory trusts and move laterally within the network after encrypting configuration files and hiding malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery tactic is relevant, specifically T1482-Domain Trust Discovery, which involves enumerating Active Directory trusts. Additionally, T1087.002-Domain Account is also related, but it pertains to the discovery of domain account information, not lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about two distinct actions: enumerating Active Directory trusts (T1482) and moving laterally within the network (implied by the use of compromised legitimate privileged accounts). The related TTPs suggest that the Lazarus Group may indeed enumerate Active Directory trusts (T1482) before moving laterally within the network (implied by the use of compromised legitimate privileged accounts).

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Lazarus Group will enumerate Active Directory trusts (T1482) before moving laterally within the network using compromised legitimate privileged accounts. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
