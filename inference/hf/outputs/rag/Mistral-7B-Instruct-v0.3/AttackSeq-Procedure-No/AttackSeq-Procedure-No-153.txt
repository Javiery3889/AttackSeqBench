 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts, given that they have already used dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure and employed tools like Robocopy and PSCP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Collection (T1074.002-Remote Data Staging) and Tactic: Command and Control (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is collecting data remotely and using multi-stage channels for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question and related TTPs both indicate that APT10 is involved in data collection and command and control activities. Staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts aligns well with the TTPs mentioned, as it is a method of data collection (T1074.002) and could be considered a part of a multi-stage command and control channel (T1104).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given that APT10 has already used dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure and employed tools like Robocopy and PSCP, it is likely that they would use these tools to stage data for exfiltration.
   - The use of multi-part archives and compression tools is a common method for data exfiltration, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.
   - Launching these tools via remote command execution scripts is also a plausible method for APT10, as they have demonstrated the ability to execute commands remotely.
   - Therefore, the answer is Yes, it is likely that APT10 will stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.
