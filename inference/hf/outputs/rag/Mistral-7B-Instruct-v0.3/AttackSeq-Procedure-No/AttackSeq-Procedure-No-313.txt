 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of the Dragonfly group using the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally after using self-deleting code for defense evasion.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Defense Evasion (T1070) and Lateral Movement (T1021).
3. The use of self-deleting code (T1070) is a technique used to evade detection, making it less likely for the attacker to be discovered during the initial stages of the attack.
4. After successfully evading detection, it is common for attackers to move laterally within a network to gather more information and prepare for further attacks (T1021).
5. The question specifically mentions the discovery tactic, which involves gathering system information. Moving laterally to Windows systems (which are often targeted for system information gathering) would be a logical next step after evading detection and moving laterally.
6. Therefore, it is plausible that the Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems before focusing on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic.
