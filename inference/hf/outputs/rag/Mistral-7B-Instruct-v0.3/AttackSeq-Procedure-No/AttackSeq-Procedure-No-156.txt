 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT10 is likely to exfiltrate data using the MIME protocol after using dynamic-DNS domains and transferring data using Robocopy and PSCP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and the Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. However, it does not mention the MIME protocol or any other specific protocol for exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the MIME protocol, but the related TTPs do not provide any information about this protocol being used by APT10 for exfiltration. The techniques mentioned (Robocopy and PSCP) are more related to data transfer, not exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if APT10 is likely to use the MIME protocol for exfiltration after using dynamic-DNS domains and transferring data using Robocopy and PSCP. However, the related TTPs do not provide any information about APT10 using the MIME protocol for exfiltration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
