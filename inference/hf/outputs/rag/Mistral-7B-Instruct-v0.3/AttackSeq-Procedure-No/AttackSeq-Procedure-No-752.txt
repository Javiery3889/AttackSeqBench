 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Rising Sun implant is likely to perform Discovery activities (T1016) and Command and Control activities (T1104). However, there is no mention of MAC address collection (T1016.003-MAC Address Collection) in the question or the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about MAC address collection, and the related TTPs do not suggest that this activity is a part of the Rising Sun implant's discovery or command and control activities. Therefore, it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host.
   - The related TTPs do not suggest that MAC address collection is a part of the Rising Sun implant's activities.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
