 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data to remote servers via FTP.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke is involved in data exfiltration (T1020) and keylogging (T1056.001), which are collection techniques. However, there is no mention of screenshotting or clipboard stealing in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after data exfiltration. Since screenshotting and clipboard stealing are not mentioned in the related TTPs, it is less likely that CosmicDuke would use these techniques after exfiltrating data.
