 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Earth Lusca, after using tools for network machine discovery, is likely to use pass the hash for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing network discovery and share discovery. These TTPs are not directly related to pass the hash or data collection using WinRAR or megacmd.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a specific technique (T1078: Pass the Hash) for lateral movement, but the related TTPs do not suggest this technique. Instead, they indicate that the attacker is discovering networks and shares, which are part of the initial reconnaissance phase. Pass the hash is typically used in the lateral movement phase, not immediately after discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Earth Lusca will use pass the hash for lateral movement after network discovery.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing network and share discovery, which is part of the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - Pass the hash is a technique used in the lateral movement phase, not immediately after discovery. Therefore, it is unlikely that Earth Lusca will use pass the hash for lateral movement immediately after network and share discovery.
   - Final Answer: No.
