 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services) and Execution (T1610-Deploy Container). However, there is no mention of Credential Access (T1552.007-Container API) during the initial access or execution phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the detection of compromised Docker APIs during the reconnaissance phase. Since the related TTPs do not indicate any specific action related to detection during the reconnaissance phase, it is unlikely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs only after deploying malicious containers.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, the answer is "No". Adversaries are not likely to detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
