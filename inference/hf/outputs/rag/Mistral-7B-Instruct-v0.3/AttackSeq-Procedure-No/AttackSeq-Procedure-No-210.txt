 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel, given that system information discovery and screen capture capabilities have been employed.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Exfiltration (Tactic) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique). This suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system, collected data, and is now looking to send this data back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is as follows:
   - System Information Discovery and Screen Capture Capabilities (Initial Access, Discovery)
   - Communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port (Command and Control)
   - Exfiltration of data through the same C2 channel (Exfiltration)

Given this sequence, it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
