 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Charming Kitten is likely to acquire infrastructures by developing phishing sites only after leveraging them to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Charming Kitten uses spear-phishing for information gathering (T1598.001) and initial access (T1566 - Phishing). However, there is no mention of developing phishing sites for infrastructure acquisition.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs where Charming Kitten first gains initial access through spear-phishing, then develops phishing sites to acquire infrastructures. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence, as they only show Charming Kitten using spear-phishing for information gathering and initial access, but not for infrastructure acquisition.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is not likely that Charming Kitten will acquire infrastructures by developing phishing sites only after leveraging them to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.
