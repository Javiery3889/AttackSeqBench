 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if T9000, after evading detection and customizing its installation, is likely to use LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials for subsequent attacks before exfiltrating data.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Tactic: Credential Access and Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are relevant to the question. This technique is used to gather NetNTLM credentials, which aligns with the question's requirement of gathering credentials for subsequent attacks.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after evading detection. The TTPs mentioned in the question (LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay) are not directly related to exfiltrating data or using a C2 server, but they are a common sequence of TTPs used for credential theft. Since T9000 has evaded detection and customized its installation, it is likely that it would use these TTPs to gather credentials before moving on to other stages such as data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: After evading detection and customizing its installation, T9000 is likely to use LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials for subsequent attacks. This is based on the related TTPs provided and the sequence of TTPs commonly used in an attack. Therefore, the final answer is Yes.
