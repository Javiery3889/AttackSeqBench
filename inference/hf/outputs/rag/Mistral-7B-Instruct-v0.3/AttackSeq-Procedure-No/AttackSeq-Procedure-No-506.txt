 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER, a tool often associated with ShadowPad.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is being used, specifically the Technique T1543.002-Systemd Service. This technique involves creating or modifying system services to ensure the malware persists across reboots.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the configuration of Systemd for persistence, which aligns with the TTP T1543.002-Systemd Service. This technique is often used for persistence, and GOGETTER is a tool associated with ShadowPad. Therefore, it is plausible that ShadowPad would use this technique to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.
