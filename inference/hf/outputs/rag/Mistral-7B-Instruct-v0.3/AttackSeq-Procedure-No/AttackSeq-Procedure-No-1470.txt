 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that BlackEnergy 3, a malicious implant, will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Discovery (T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks) and Tactic: Execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic).

   - T1497.002 is related to the Discovery phase, where an adversary gathers information about the network and systems using user activity-based checks. This does not directly involve the use of Ruby scripts or Visual Basic for payload execution.

   - T1059.005 is related to the Execution phase, where an adversary uses Visual Basic scripts to execute payloads. This is a different scripting language than Ruby.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of Ruby scripts, but the related TTPs do not mention the use of Ruby scripts for payload execution. On the other hand, T1059.005 mentions the use of Visual Basic scripts, which is different from Ruby. Therefore, it is less likely that BlackEnergy 3, a known malware, would use Ruby scripts for payload execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:

   - The question asks if BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

   - The related TTPs do not mention the use of Ruby scripts for payload execution. Instead, T1059.005 mentions the use of Visual Basic scripts.

   - Therefore, it is less likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts for payload execution. Final Answer: B: No.
