 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke, after targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery, captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is involved in Credential Access (T1056) and Collection (T1056) activities, specifically using Web Portal Capture (T1056.003). This technique involves capturing credentials by manipulating web portals.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about capturing credentials on a specific web portal (Ivanti Connect Secure). The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke uses the same technique (T1056.003) to capture credentials from web portals. Therefore, it is plausible that CosmicDuke could capture credentials entered on the Ivanti Connect Secure login page.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke captures credentials on a specific web portal (Ivanti Connect Secure).
   - The related TTPs indicate that CosmicDuke uses the technique T1056.003 (Web Portal Capture) for Credential Access and Collection.
   - Since Ivanti Connect Secure is a web portal and CosmicDuke uses T1056.003 to capture credentials from web portals, it is likely that CosmicDuke could capture credentials entered on the Ivanti Connect Secure login page.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
