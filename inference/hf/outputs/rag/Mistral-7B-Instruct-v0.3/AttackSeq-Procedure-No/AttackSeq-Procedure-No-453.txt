 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT-TOCS, after downloading encrypted data scripts for command and control operations using PowerShell, is likely to exhibit lateral movement within the internal network.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement and the Technique of T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer. This technique involves moving an attacker's tools and resources from an initial foothold to other systems, which is a common method for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about lateral movement, and the related TTPs provide evidence that APT-TOCS might perform lateral movement. The downloaded scripts could potentially be used to transfer tools or resources to other systems within the network, which aligns with the T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer technique.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of APT-TOCS exhibiting lateral movement.
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Lateral Movement and the Technique of T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, which involves moving an attacker's tools and resources from an initial foothold to other systems.
   - Since the downloaded scripts could potentially be used to transfer tools or resources to other systems within the network, it is plausible that APT-TOCS will exhibit lateral movement.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1059.001-PowerShell (Execution) to download encrypted data scripts.
   - T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (Lateral Movement) to transfer the downloaded scripts to other systems within the network for command and control operations.
