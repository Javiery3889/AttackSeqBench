 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, after establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel, performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor used protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel (T1572-Protocol Tunneling, T1071.004-DNS). Additionally, the Discovery tactic (T1057-Process Discovery) is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a common tactic used after establishing a C2 channel to gather information about the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Discovery phase, and while the related TTPs do not explicitly mention process discovery and system information discovery, they do indicate that a C2 channel was established. Given that establishing a C2 channel is a common precursor to the Discovery phase, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor would perform process discovery and system information discovery after establishing the C2 channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The SombRAT backdoor, after establishing a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, is likely to perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase. This is a common sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, where establishing a C2 channel allows the attacker to gather information about the compromised system. Final Answer: Yes.
