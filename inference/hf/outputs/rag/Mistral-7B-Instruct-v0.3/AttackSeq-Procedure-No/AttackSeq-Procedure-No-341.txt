 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that a zero-day exploit will bypass Extended Address Space (EAF) mitigation before attempting to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protections.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is using a client-side exploitation technique (T1203) and a defense evasion technique (T1211). This suggests that the attacker is trying to execute malicious code on the victim's system and evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question specifically asks about the sequence of bypassing EAF, ASLR, and DEP. EAF mitigation is a technique used to prevent attacks like return-oriented programming (ROP) by restricting the use of certain memory regions. However, it is common for zero-day exploits to bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP, as ASLR and DEP are more commonly used and easier to bypass. By executing shellcode to make memory executable during the exploitation phase, the attacker is already manipulating the memory, which could potentially bypass EAF. Therefore, it is more plausible that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if a zero-day exploit will bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attack is using a client-side exploitation technique and a defense evasion technique, indicating that the attacker is trying to execute malicious code and evade detection.
   - It is common for zero-day exploits to bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP, as ASLR and DEP are more commonly used and easier to bypass. By executing shellcode to make memory executable during the exploitation phase, the attacker is manipulating the memory, which could potentially bypass EAF.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP.
