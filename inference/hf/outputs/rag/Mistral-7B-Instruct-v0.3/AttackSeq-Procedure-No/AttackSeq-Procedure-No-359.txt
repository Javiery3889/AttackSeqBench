 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of events after data collection, compression, and storage. The related TTPs provided indicate that the data collection and compression steps are part of the Collection tactic (T1560).
2. The data is then stored in hidden folders on external storage, which is not directly related to the Exfiltration tactic (T1041).
3. However, the question asks if the data will be exfiltrated over C2 channels after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data. This implies that the data has already been stored or exposed on the C2 infrastructure before being exfiltrated.
4. Given that the data has been stored on external storage (which is not the C2 infrastructure), it is likely that the data will be moved to the C2 infrastructure before being exfiltrated.
5. Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers will utilize the C2 infrastructure to store or expose the data before exfiltrating it over C2 channels.
6. Thus, the answer A: Yes is the most likely sequence of TTPs in this scenario.
