 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT15 is likely to use credential stuffing against victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already gained initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts). Additionally, the attacker is also known to use valid accounts to gain access (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts). This suggests that the attacker may use other methods to obtain more valid accounts, such as credential stuffing.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if APT15 is likely to use credential stuffing. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that APT15 would use credential stuffing to obtain more valid accounts, as they have already demonstrated the use of valid accounts for initial access.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that APT15 would use credential stuffing against victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
