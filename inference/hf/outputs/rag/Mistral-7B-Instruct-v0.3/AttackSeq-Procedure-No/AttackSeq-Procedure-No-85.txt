 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Vyveva's backdoor collects files from the computer only after obtaining system information.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is performing Collection (T1005) and Discovery (T1082) activities. T1005 specifically mentions data from local systems, which could include system information like computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and local IP address.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question. If the backdoor is collecting system information (T1082) before collecting files (T1005), then it is likely that it collects files only after obtaining system information.
4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor collects system information first (T1082) and then collects files (T1005). Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
