 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it's likely that a JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL only after 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Defense Evasion (T1027.006-HTML Smuggling) and Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript, T1059.005-Visual Basic). However, there's no mention of a specific sequence or connection between these TTPs and the dropping of 'nanagrams.exe' or the revealing of 'surprise.php' source code.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks for a specific sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not provide enough information to support the sequence described in answer choice A. The TTPs suggest that obfuscated VBA-Macro functions are used to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file, but they do not specify that this file is 'nanagrams.exe' or that it is dropped only after 'surprise.php' reveals its source code.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it's not likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL only before 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
