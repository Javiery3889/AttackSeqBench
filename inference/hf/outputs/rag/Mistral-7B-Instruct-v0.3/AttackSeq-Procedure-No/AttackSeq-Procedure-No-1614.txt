 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers after accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is collecting email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI (T1114.001-Local Email Collection) and email forwarding rules (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule). However, neither of these techniques directly involves the use of FTP for exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about FTP exfiltration, but the related TTPs do not indicate any FTP activity. Therefore, it is unlikely that the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks about FTP exfiltration, but the related TTPs do not indicate any FTP activity.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
