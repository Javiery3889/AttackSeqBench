 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group conducted specific attacks to map the organization's internal network, collect administrative-level credentials, and then compromise additional endpoints.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay, and Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay. This technique is used for both credential access and collection, suggesting that it could be part of the sequence of TTPs used by the Carbanak group.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Carbanak group. The related TTPs provided are techniques used for both credential access and collection, which aligns with the sequence of activities described in the question: mapping the network, collecting credentials, and then compromising additional endpoints. The Carbanak group is known to use these techniques, making it plausible that they conducted LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks before compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes". The Carbanak group likely conducted LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
