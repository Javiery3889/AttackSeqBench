 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs involve Discovery tactics, which are activities aimed at gathering information about the target network and systems. These TTPs do not directly relate to the installation of malware or establishing communication with Command-and-Control servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not specify that the Discovery TTPs must occur after the installation of the malware. In fact, Discovery TTPs are often performed before the installation of malware to gather information about the target network and systems. Therefore, it is not likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Discovery TTPs (T1018-Remote System Discovery, T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks) are typically performed before the installation of malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
   - Since the Discovery TTPs can occur before the installation of the malware, it is not likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
