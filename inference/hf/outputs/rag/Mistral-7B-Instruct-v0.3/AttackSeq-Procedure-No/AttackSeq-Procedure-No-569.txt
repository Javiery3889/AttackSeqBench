 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors would gain knowledge about systems and the internal network using Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques only after employing techniques to gain elevated permissions under the Privilege Escalation tactic.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Lateral Movement (T1210) and Discovery (T1007, T1087). These TTPs suggest that the threat actors may move laterally within the network and discover system services, but they do not necessarily imply that privilege escalation has occurred.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the Execution phase, where system services and software deployment tools were used to execute code. The related TTPs do not indicate a requirement for privilege escalation before Discovery techniques (T1007, T1087). Therefore, it is not necessary for the threat actors to gain elevated permissions before using Process Discovery (T1057) and Query Registry (T1015) techniques.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the threat actors would gain knowledge about systems and the internal network using Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques only after employing techniques to gain elevated permissions under the Privilege Escalation tactic. The answer is "No".
