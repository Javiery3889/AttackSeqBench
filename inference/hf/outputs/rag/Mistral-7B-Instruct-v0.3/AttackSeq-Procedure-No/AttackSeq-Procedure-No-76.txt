 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will extract emails from archived Outlook .pst files for transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers after gathering information about the infected computer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1087.003-Email Account, and Tactic: Collection and Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection. These TTPs suggest that the malware is gathering email-related information, but they do not directly indicate that the malware will extract emails from archived .pst files or transmit the data through encrypted emails.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are "Yes" and "No". The related TTPs do not provide enough evidence to support the answer "Yes". The malware might have the capability to extract emails from .pst files, but the question asks about the likelihood of this specific action given the information provided. Since the question does not mention any TTPs related to data transmission through encrypted emails, it is more plausible that the malware will not extract emails from archived .pst files for transmitting the data through encrypted emails to the attackers.

Therefore, the final answer is "B: No".
