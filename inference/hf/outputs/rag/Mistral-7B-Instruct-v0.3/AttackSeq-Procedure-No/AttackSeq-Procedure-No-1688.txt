 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled, given that they have persisted by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are involved in Credential Access (T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning), Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials), and Collection (T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning). ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic, often for the purpose of stealing credentials or gaining unauthorized access to systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs suggested in the question is: ARP cache poisoning (T1557.002) -> Credential Access (T1589.001) -> Uploading credentials to an external FTP server (implied). However, the related TTPs do not suggest a sequence that includes uploading credentials to an external FTP server before ARP cache poisoning.

   - ARP cache poisoning is typically used for Reconnaissance or Credential Access, not for Collection after Credential Access.
   - Uploading credentials to an external FTP server is more likely to be a part of the Collection phase, not before ARP cache poisoning.

4. Conclusion: Based on the related TTPs, it is more likely that the sequence of TTPs would be: Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials) -> Credential Access (T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning) -> Collection (T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning) -> Exfiltration (Uploading credentials to an external FTP server). Therefore, the answer is No, it is not likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled, given the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
