 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Hacking Team's spyware authors established communication with C&C servers before using VMProtect for obfuscation.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used spearphishing emails to deliver spyware and later used obfuscation (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) as a defense evasion technique. However, there is no mention of communication with C&C servers in the related TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs suggest that the obfuscation (T1027) was used after the initial access (T1566.001) was gained through spearphishing. There is no indication that communication with C&C servers occurred before the obfuscation step.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware did not establish communication with the identified C&C servers before using VMProtect for obfuscation. The obfuscation step typically comes after initial access and before maintaining persistence or communication with C&C servers. Therefore, the answer is "No".
