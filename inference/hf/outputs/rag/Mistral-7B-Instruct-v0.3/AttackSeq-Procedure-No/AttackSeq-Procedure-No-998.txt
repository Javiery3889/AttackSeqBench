 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware, after a zero-day exploit is used to infect a target with Plexor malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) and Credential Access (T1528-Steal Application Access Token), but there is no mention of Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection) or any other TTPs related to email account access or system discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after the initial infection with Plexor malware. However, the related TTPs do not suggest that Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens or perform email account access or system discovery before system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware. The sequence of TTPs suggested by the question (abuse OAuth access tokens, system fingerprinting, and discovery) does not align with the related TTPs provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware. However, the related TTPs do not suggest this sequence of events. Therefore, it is not likely that Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware. Final Answer: No.
