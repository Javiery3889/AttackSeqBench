 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Moafee and DragonOK are likely to use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques to execute their payloads, given that they have already used spear-phishing emails as the primary attack vector to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers have already used Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1566-Phishing to gain access. This suggests that they have already gained a foothold in the target environment. The Tactic: Resource Development and Technique: T1587.001-Malware are related to the development and deployment of malware, which aligns with the question's context of resource development.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. The most plausible sequence would be:
   - Initial Access (T1566-Phishing)
   - Initial Foothold (Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads)
   - Resource Development (T1587.001-Malware, specifically the development and deployment of custom-built backdoors and RATs)

Given this sequence, it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK would utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques to execute their payloads. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
