 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the threat actors have already used Mimikatz to dump credentials and employed Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash for credential access. This suggests that they have gained initial access to the system and have moved laterally using Pass-the-Hash technique. However, there is no indication that they have used AntSword webshells or Impacket atexec for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after pass-the-hash. The related TTPs do not suggest that AntSword webshells or Impacket atexec were used for lateral movement before the events in question. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would run commands to perform permission groups discovery after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec, as there is no evidence that they have used these tools for lateral movement in the first place.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the threat actors have used Mimikatz and Impacket tools for credential access and lateral movement, but there is no evidence that they have used AntSword webshells or Impacket atexec for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that they would run commands to perform permission groups discovery after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec, as there is no evidence that they have used these tools for lateral movement in the first place.
   - Final Answer: No.
