 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely to observe document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts after APT28's malicious document uses DDE via PowerShell to execute encoded commands.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking) and Tactic: Execution (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange). These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using techniques to evade detection and execute malicious code, but they do not directly indicate document hijacking or manipulation of application-specific startup scripts.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about document hijacking, but the related TTPs do not provide evidence to support this action. The Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique is used for executing malicious code, not for hijacking documents or application-specific startup scripts. Therefore, it is unlikely to observe document hijacking in this scenario.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe document hijacking after APT28's malicious document uses DDE via PowerShell to execute encoded commands.
   - The related TTPs mention Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking) and Tactic: Execution (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange), which suggest the use of techniques to evade detection and execute malicious code, but do not indicate document hijacking or manipulation of application-specific startup scripts.
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is unlikely to observe document hijacking in this scenario. Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
