 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the likelihood of ProjectM executing malicious code after evading defense measures. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Execution (T1204) which involves the use of malicious files.

2. The question also mentions the Initial Access tactic (T1566), specifically Spearphishing Attachment, which is a method of delivering malicious files to gain initial access.

3. The malicious files mentioned in the question are RTF and Excel files, which are known to be used in spearphishing attacks.

4. The question also mentions the use of Trojans (Crimson and Peppy) and RATs (DarkComet and Bozok) for execution. These are advanced techniques that are often used after initial access has been gained and a foothold established in the target system.

5. The question also mentions the exploitation of known vulnerabilities, which is a common tactic used in spearphishing attacks to deliver malicious files.

6. Given the sequence of events described in the question (evasion, initial access, delivery of malicious files, and execution of malware), it is plausible that ProjectM would execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.

7. Therefore, the answer is "Yes". ProjectM is likely to execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs after gaining initial access through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
