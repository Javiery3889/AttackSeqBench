 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Resource Development (T1584.001-Domains) and Initial Access (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise). The Resource Development TTPs are about acquiring infrastructure, which includes parking domains for future use.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs suggest that the attackers first compromise the software supply chain (T1195) to gain initial access, and then they perform Resource Development activities, including parking domains (T1584.001). Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers parked domains for future use after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
