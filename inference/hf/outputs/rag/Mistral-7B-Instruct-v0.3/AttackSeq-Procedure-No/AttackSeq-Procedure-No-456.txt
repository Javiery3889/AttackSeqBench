 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory during the attack's core step, instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell, indicates that PowerShell is being used for execution. This technique is often associated with the use of PowerShell scripts for various malicious activities, including credential harvesting.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests that after APT-TOCS gained initial access using PowerShell, they executed Shellcode scripts for remote control. However, the core step of the attack is not specified to be Shellcode script execution. Instead, the question mentions the possibility of a credential harvesting tool being used. Given the related TTP of T1059.001-PowerShell, it is more likely that PowerShell scripts would be used for this purpose to evade defenses.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory during the attack's core step. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
