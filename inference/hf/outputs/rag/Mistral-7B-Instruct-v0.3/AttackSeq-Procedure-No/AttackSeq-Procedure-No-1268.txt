 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish (T1192 - Exploitation of Remote Services), the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that Discovery is a tactic of interest, and T1526-Cloud Service Discovery and T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery are techniques under this tactic. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is interested in discovering cloud services and infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the enumeration of AWS infrastructure, which aligns with the TTPs provided, specifically T1526-Cloud Service Discovery and T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery. These TTPs indicate that the attacker would likely enumerate cloud infrastructure after gaining initial access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish, the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure.
   - The related TTPs provided indicate that Discovery is a tactic of interest, and T1526-Cloud Service Discovery and T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery are techniques under this tactic.
   - Given that the question asks about enumerating AWS infrastructure, which aligns with the TTPs provided, it is likely that the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
