 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Initial Access has been achieved through T1133-External Remote Services (phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments) and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (employees enabling macros to install BlackEnergy 3 malware).
2. The Tactic mentioned in the question is Lateral Movement, which is a common step after Initial Access to move within the network.
3. The Related TTPs list includes T1534-Internal Spearphishing, which is a technique used for Lateral Movement. This suggests that the adversaries may use similar methods for moving laterally within the network.
4. AnyDesk and PuTTy are legitimate utilities often used for Remote Access, which is a technique under the Lateral Movement tactic.
5. After maintaining remote access, it is likely that the adversaries will perform internal network reconnaissance (Tactic: Discovery) and credential harvesting (Tactic: Credential Access) to further compromise the network.

Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will use legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
