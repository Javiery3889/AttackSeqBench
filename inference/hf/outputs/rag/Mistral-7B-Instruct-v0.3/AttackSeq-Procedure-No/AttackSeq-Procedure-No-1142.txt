 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are Discovery and the techniques are Remote System Discovery and File and Directory Discovery. These TTPs focus on identifying systems and services, not necessarily on discovering file and directory listings or metadata for files on disk.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are Yes and No. The related TTPs do not suggest that file and directory listings or metadata for files on disk will be retrieved during the discovery phase. Instead, they indicate that the attacker is discovering systems and services. Therefore, the most plausible answer is No.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the tactics involved are Discovery and the techniques are Remote System Discovery and File and Directory Discovery. These TTPs focus on identifying systems and services, not necessarily on discovering file and directory listings or metadata for files on disk.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is No. The attacker, after discovering systems and services, would likely move to other tactics like Initial Access or Execution to gain access to the systems and then potentially perform File and Directory Discovery to find files and their metadata.
