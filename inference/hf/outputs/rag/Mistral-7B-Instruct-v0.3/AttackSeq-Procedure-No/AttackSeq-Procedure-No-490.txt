 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link. This technique involves sending a link within an email that, when clicked, leads to a malicious website or downloads a malicious file.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTP (T1566.002) is a method often used for initial access, which means it is typically the first step in an attack sequence. Stealing application access tokens can be considered a Discovery phase activity, as it involves gathering information about the target system. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker would first use a spear-phishing link to gain initial access and then move on to steal application access tokens.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
