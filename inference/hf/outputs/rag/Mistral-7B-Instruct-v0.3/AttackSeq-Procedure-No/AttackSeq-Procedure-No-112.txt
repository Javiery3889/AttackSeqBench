 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will perform taint shared content (T1080) and lateral movement (T1570) after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are T1080-Taint Shared Content (a technique under the Lateral Movement tactic) and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (also a technique under the Lateral Movement tactic). This suggests that the question is asking about a sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase. T1080-Taint Shared Content is a technique used to achieve lateral movement, and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is also a technique used for lateral movement. Installing additional persistence points (not mentioned in the question or related TTPs) would typically come after lateral movement, not before. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1080-Taint Shared Content followed by T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if attackers will taint shared content and perform lateral movement after the discovery phase.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the question is about a sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement.
   - T1080-Taint Shared Content is a technique used to achieve lateral movement, and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is also a technique used for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1080-Taint Shared Content followed by T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
