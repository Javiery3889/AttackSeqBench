 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot and Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery. The technique T1562.009 is related to booting a system in safe mode, which is a defense evasion tactic often used to bypass security software. T1082 is a technique used for system information discovery, which could be the next step after booting in safe mode to gather details about the victim's computer.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The technique T1562.009 (Safe Mode Boot) is a defense evasion tactic that could be used to avoid detection before performing further actions, such as T1082 (System Information Discovery). Therefore, it is plausible that Grandoreiro would restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information.
   - The related TTPs suggest that T1562.009 (Safe Mode Boot) is a defense evasion tactic often used to bypass security software, and T1082 (System Information Discovery) is a technique used to gather details about the victim's computer.
   - Given that T1562.009 (Safe Mode Boot) is a tactic used to evade detection, it is plausible that Grandoreiro would use this technique before performing T1082 (System Information Discovery).
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes, it is likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer.
