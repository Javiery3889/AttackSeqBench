 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Black Energy 2 is likely to inject a DLL into the svchost.exe process to maintain persistence only after the botnet's command-and-control center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Privilege Escalation and Technique: T1055-Process Injection, as well as Tactic: Defense Evasion and Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection. These TTPs suggest that the malware may use process injection and DLL injection for privilege escalation and defense evasion, but they do not necessarily imply that the DLL injection is conditional on HTTP communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks for a specific condition (HTTP communication) that triggers the DLL injection. None of the answer choices or related TTPs explicitly state this condition. However, the question's phrasing suggests that the DLL injection is a persistent mechanism, which is not typically conditional on each communication with the command-and-control server.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is B: No, Black Energy 2 is not likely to inject a DLL into the svchost.exe process to maintain persistence only after the botnet's command-and-control center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests. The question's phrasing and the related TTPs do not support this condition.
