 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.
2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence starts with Initial Access, specifically T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, and then mentions T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain, which is a technique for Initial Access as well.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The question describes the Higaisa APT group distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing, which aligns with T1566.002. However, this technique does not directly lead to compromising web browser updates. The T1195.002 technique, Compromise Software Supply Chain, could potentially be used to compromise web browser updates, allowing the delivery of a backdoor. Therefore, it is plausible that the Higaisa APT group could use this sequence of TTPs to achieve their goal.

In summary, the Higaisa APT group first uses T1566.002 to gain Initial Access by distributing malicious LNK files. Then, they could potentially use T1195.002 to compromise the software supply chain, including web browser updates, to deliver a backdoor. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
