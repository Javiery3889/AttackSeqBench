 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use token impersonation or theft techniques after scheduling a script for persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques for Privilege Escalation (T1134.001), Persistence (T1053.005), and Defense Evasion (T1134.001). However, the specific focus is on token impersonation or theft (T1134.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' for persistence. This action is related to the Persistence TTP (T1053.005). However, the question does not provide any information about token impersonation or theft happening before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.

4. The question does not provide any evidence that the Konni APT Group would use token impersonation or theft techniques before the scheduled script 'install.vbs' runs. Therefore, it is more likely that they would focus on their persistence and defense evasion techniques before moving on to other actions such as token impersonation or theft.

So, the answer is No, the Konni APT Group is not likely to use token impersonation or theft techniques before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.
