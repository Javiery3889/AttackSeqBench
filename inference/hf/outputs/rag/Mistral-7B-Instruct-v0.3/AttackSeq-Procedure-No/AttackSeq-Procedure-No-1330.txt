 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Sayad malware will collect the username from an infected host before communicating with its C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery. This technique involves the collection of information about the system owner or user.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTP (T1033-System Owner/User Discovery) suggests that the malware is likely to perform activities related to discovering system information, including usernames. After performing discovery activities, it is plausible for the malware to collect the username from the infected host before communicating with its C2 server.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTP, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Discovery (T1033) - System Owner/User Discovery (T1033.001) - Collect the username from the infected host.
   - Tactic: Command and Control (T1077) - Communication with C2 server (T1077.001) - Communicate with the C2 server at 107.6.182.179.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
