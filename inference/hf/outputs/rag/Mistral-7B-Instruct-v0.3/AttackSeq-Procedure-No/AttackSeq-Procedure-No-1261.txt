 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack is likely to involve the Discovery tactic (T1018) and the Initial Access tactic (T1189). The Discovery tactic is typically used to gather information about the target environment, while the Initial Access tactic is used to establish a foothold in the target system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Get-NetComputer command is a tool used for remote system discovery, which aligns with the Discovery tactic. On the other hand, the SocGholish framework is a technique for initial compromise, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.

   - If the attackers were to use the Get-NetComputer command first, it would be for discovery purposes, which is not typically the first step in an attack sequence that involves initial compromise.
   - However, if they were to use the SocGholish framework first, it would allow them to establish a foothold in the target system, making it easier to perform discovery tasks later.

   Therefore, it is more likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command for remote system discovery.

In conclusion, the answer is No. The attackers are not likely to use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.
