 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Iron Tiger malware will download additional payloads onto an infected machine using a command-and-control server after persistence is achieved via creating a new service or registry key.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Persistence (T1547.001) and the creation of a new service or registry key. This indicates that persistence has been established on the infected machine. Additionally, the Tactic of Command and Control (T1105) is mentioned, which involves the use of a command-and-control server. This suggests that the malware may download additional payloads using such a server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Tactic of Command and Control is not directly related to the creation of a new service or registry key, but it is a common tactic used by malware after establishing persistence. The Iron Tiger malware, being a malicious software, is likely to use a command-and-control server to download additional payloads for further exploitation.

4. Conclusion: Based on the given question and related TTPs, it is likely that the Iron Tiger malware will download additional payloads onto an infected machine using a command-and-control server after persistence is achieved via creating a new service or registry key. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
