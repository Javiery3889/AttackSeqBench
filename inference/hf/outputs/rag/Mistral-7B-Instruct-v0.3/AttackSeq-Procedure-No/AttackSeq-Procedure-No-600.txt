 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during Discovery after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the attack sequence involves Reconnaissance (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks), Discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery), and Execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about Discovery after initial access has been established. The related TTPs suggest that the attack sequence starts with Reconnaissance (scanning IP blocks), followed by Execution (using VBA macros to establish initial access), and then Discovery (network service discovery). Therefore, it is likely that the attack sequence will proceed with Discovery (T1046-Network Service Discovery) after initial access has been established, which aligns with the question.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during Discovery after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
