 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Emissary Panda, after scanning the network for vulnerable systems using CVE-2017-0144, uploaded various tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, after exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker's initial access tactic is T1190, which involves exploiting public-facing applications. However, CVE-2017-0144 is not a SharePoint vulnerability, but rather a Microsoft Equation Editor vulnerability. CVE-2019-0604, on the other hand, is a SharePoint vulnerability.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence where the attacker first exploits CVE-2017-0144 to scan for vulnerable systems, then exploits CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access, and finally uploads tools and backdoors. However, since CVE-2017-0144 is not a SharePoint vulnerability, it is unlikely that the attacker would use it to gain initial access to SharePoint servers. Instead, they would likely use CVE-2019-0604 for initial access, as indicated by the related TTPs.

4. Conclusion: Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, it is more plausible that Emissary Panda would first exploit CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access, then upload tools and backdoors, such as HyperBro, to perform execution. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
