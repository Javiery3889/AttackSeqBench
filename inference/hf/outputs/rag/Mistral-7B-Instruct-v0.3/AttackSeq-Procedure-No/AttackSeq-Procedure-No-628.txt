 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, after performing process discovery and system information discovery, would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic and the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication techniques under this tactic. These TTPs suggest the use of multi-stage channels and bidirectional communication for Command and Control, but they do not necessarily imply the use of blogs or WordPress.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the use of blogs and WordPress, which are not mentioned in the related TTPs. Therefore, it is not likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The question asks if the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure after performing process discovery and system information discovery. The related TTPs do not suggest the use of blogs or WordPress, so it is not likely that the backdoor would use these platforms for C2. Final Answer: B: No.
