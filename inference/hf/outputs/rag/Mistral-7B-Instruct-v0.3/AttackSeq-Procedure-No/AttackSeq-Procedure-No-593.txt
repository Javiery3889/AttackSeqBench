 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Sednit group is likely to achieve persistence through a Windows registry entry before creating processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments during execution.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the Sednit group may use techniques for Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task, T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) and Privilege Escalation (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder). However, these TTPs do not necessarily imply that they will create processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments during execution immediately after achieving persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events, and the related TTPs do not suggest that creating processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments is a likely step that would occur before achieving persistence through the Windows registry entry.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the Sednit group would first achieve persistence through the Windows registry entry (T1053.005-Scheduled Task, T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) and then create processes with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as arguments at a later stage, not necessarily immediately after the initial access. Therefore, the answer is "No".
