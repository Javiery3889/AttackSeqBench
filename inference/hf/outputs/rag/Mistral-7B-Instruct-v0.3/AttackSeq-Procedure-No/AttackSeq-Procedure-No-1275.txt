 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that threat actors sent phishing emails containing malicious attachments before conducting research on the targets to craft convincing emails.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the threat actors are using the Initial Access tactic, specifically the T1566.001 technique, which is Spearphishing Attachment. This technique involves sending a targeted email with a malicious attachment to induce the recipient to click it, thereby providing the attacker with initial access to the target system.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The related TTPs suggest that the threat actors are likely to use phishing emails with malicious attachments as a means of initial access. This aligns with the question, as sending such emails would be a logical step before conducting research on the targets to craft more convincing emails.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the threat actors sent phishing emails containing malicious attachments to desired targets before conducting research on the targets to craft convincing emails. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
