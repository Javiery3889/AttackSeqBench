 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery and system owner/user discovery after gaining initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack sequence involves Discovery tactics, specifically Domain Trust Discovery (T1482) and System Owner/User Discovery (T1033).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the related TTPs. After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to perform Discovery activities to understand the network and system environment. In this case, they would first discover domain trusts (T1482) using tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe, and then perform system owner/user discovery (T1033) by issuing commands like whoami.exe.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
- Gain Initial Access (T1078)
- Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
- Domain Trust Discovery (T1482)
- System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)
