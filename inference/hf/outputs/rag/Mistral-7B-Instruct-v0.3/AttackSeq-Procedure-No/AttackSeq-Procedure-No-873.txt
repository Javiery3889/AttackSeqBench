 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack starts with Initial Access through the exploitation of a public-facing application (T1190). However, there is no mention of privilege escalation or specific vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 in the initial access phase. Privilege escalation is mentioned as a separate tactic (T1068).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events leading to the Stager module's notification. The related TTPs suggest that the initial access is achieved through exploiting a public-facing application, but there is no indication that this initial access is followed by the specific chain of vulnerabilities mentioned in the question. The question does not mention the Stager module being involved in the initial access or privilege escalation phase.

4. The Stager module is typically used in a later stage of an attack, after the attacker has gained initial access and achieved privilege escalation. It is not typically involved in the initial access or privilege escalation process, so it would not be notified of successful exploitation of specific vulnerabilities during these stages. Therefore, the answer is "No".
