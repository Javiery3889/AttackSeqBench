 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Lazarus, a threat actor known for spear-phishing attacks, is likely to have executed the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory only after gaining initial access to the victim's network through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that Lazarus typically uses spear-phishing emails (T1566-Phishing, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) for initial access. This suggests that they would first gain access to the network through these means before moving on to other tactics, such as running a backdoor like ThreatNeedle in memory.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that Lazarus would first gain initial access through spear-phishing (as indicated by the related TTPs) and then execute the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory. The other answer choice, "No", would imply that Lazarus would execute the backdoor before gaining initial access, which is not supported by the provided information.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be:
- Initial Access: T1566-Phishing, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
- Initial Access: Execution: T1055-PowerShell
- Initial Access: Execution: T1203-Scripting
- Initial Access: Execution: T1585-PowerShell Empire
