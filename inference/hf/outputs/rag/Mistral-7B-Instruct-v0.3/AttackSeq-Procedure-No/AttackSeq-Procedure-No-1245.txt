 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if SUNSPOT, which is not mentioned in the related TTPs, will monitor running processes for MsBuild.exe after the SUNBURST backdoor is injected into the Orion source code.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1057-Process Discovery. This technique involves an attacker discovering running processes on a compromised system. However, it does not specify any connection to SUNSPOT or SUNBURST.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information that suggests SUNSPOT, a backdoor not mentioned in the related TTPs, would be involved in process discovery. The SUNBURST backdoor is injected into the Orion source code, and it is not inherently related to process discovery or monitoring. Therefore, it is unlikely that SUNSPOT would monitor running processes for MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is B: No. SUNSPOT is not likely to monitor running processes for MsBuild.exe after the SUNBURST backdoor is injected into the Orion source code.
