 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Derusbi will bind to a raw socket and initiate communication with the C2 server before gathering system information about the victim host.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery) is relevant, which suggests that the attacker is gathering system information about the victim host. However, the Tactic of Command and Control (T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) is also mentioned, which implies that communication with the C2 server is a part of the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs that aligns best with the question is one where the attacker first modifies the system's global call table to evade detection (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1566-Kernel Modification), then gathers system information about the victim host (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery), and finally initiates communication with the C2 server (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol). Binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server is a part of the Command and Control phase, not the System Information Gathering phase. Therefore, it is more likely that Derusbi will gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

In conclusion, the answer is B: No. Derusbi is not likely to bind to a raw socket and initiate communication with the C2 server before gathering system information about the victim host.
