 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s after sending emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the use of Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for resource development, which is typically used to host infrastructure for command and control (C2) servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the development of VPS infrastructure for hosting malware C2s. The related TTPs suggest that the adversary has the intention to use VPS for resource development, which aligns with the development of C2 servers. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) to gain access to the target system.
   - Command and Control (T1086-PowerShell) to execute commands on the compromised system.
   - Resource Development (T1583.003-Virtual Private Server) to set up VPS infrastructure.
   - Command and Control (T1055-C2 Beacon) to use the VPS infrastructure as a C2 server to communicate with the compromised system.
