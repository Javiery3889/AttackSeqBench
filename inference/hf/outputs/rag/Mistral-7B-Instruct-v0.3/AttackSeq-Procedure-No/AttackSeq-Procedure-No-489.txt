 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Discovery phase (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery) and Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping) are both involved. This suggests that the attacker first gains access to the system through dumped credentials (T1003) and then proceeds to gather system information (T1082) as part of the Discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker would first perform credential dumping (T1003) to gain access to the system, and then proceed to the Discovery phase (T1082). Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker would first perform credential dumping (T1003) to gain access to the system, and then proceed to the Discovery phase (T1082).
   - Therefore, based on the sequence of events suggested by the related TTPs, it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
