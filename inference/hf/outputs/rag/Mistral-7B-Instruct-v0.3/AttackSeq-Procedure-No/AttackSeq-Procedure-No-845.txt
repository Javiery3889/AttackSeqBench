 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves T1204.002 - Malicious File, which is a technique used to deliver malware through a file. However, this TTP does not inherently involve the use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture or the inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events that includes the use of base64 blobs, system architecture-specific execution, and an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The T1204.002 technique does not necessarily involve base64 blobs or system architecture-specific execution, and there is no mention of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros in the related TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
