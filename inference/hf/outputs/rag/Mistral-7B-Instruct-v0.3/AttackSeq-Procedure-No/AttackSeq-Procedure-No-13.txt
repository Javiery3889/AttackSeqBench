 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if APT42 will conduct internal reconnaissance after moving laterally using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that APT42 is using internal spearphishing (T1534-Internal Spearphishing) and email account compromise (T1586.002-Email Accounts) for their attack. However, internal reconnaissance (T1087-Network Discovery) is not explicitly mentioned as a step that follows the use of compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of events, but the related TTPs do not support this sequence. The question assumes that APT42 would first move laterally and then conduct internal reconnaissance, but the TTPs do not indicate this as a common or likely sequence of events.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided information, it is not likely that APT42 will conduct internal reconnaissance only after moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts. This sequence of events is not supported by the provided TTPs.
