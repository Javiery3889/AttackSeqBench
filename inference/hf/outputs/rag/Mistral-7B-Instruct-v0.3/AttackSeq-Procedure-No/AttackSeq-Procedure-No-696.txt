 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon, after gaining initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures, will use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Tactic of Persistence is followed by the Technique T1053.005-Scheduled Task. This technique involves the use of the Windows Task Scheduler to create a scheduled task for persistence. However, it does not necessarily mean that this is the first step after initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after initial access. The TTPs suggest that Gamaredon may use the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence, but they do not rule out the possibility that this could happen before or after other actions. However, the question specifically mentions the use of the task scheduler before achieving persistence through the registry. This sequence is plausible because scheduling a task can be a way to ensure the malware runs again after a reboot, which is a common step towards achieving persistence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that Gamaredon will use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
