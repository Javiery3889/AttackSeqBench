 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Regin, a known advanced persistent threat (APT), is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that Regin is using network sniffing (T1040) and system information discovery (T1082), which are both part of the Discovery tactic. Additionally, process discovery (T1057) is also a technique that is often associated with Regin.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Regin is known to perform extensive reconnaissance and information gathering during the discovery phase. Network sniffing (T1040) is a method used to capture and analyze network traffic, which can include information about processes and memory utilization. System information discovery (T1082) is a technique used to gather information about the target system, including details about the operating system, installed software, and running processes. Process discovery (T1057) is a technique used to identify the processes running on a system, which can help an attacker understand the system's configuration and capabilities. Scanning for deleted files (T1088.003) is also a common technique used during the discovery phase to uncover potential artifacts that may have been left behind.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is plausible that Regin would gather information on processes and memory utilization (T1057) and scan for deleted files (T1088.003) during the discovery phase. Therefore, the answer is Yes (A).
