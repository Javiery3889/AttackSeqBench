 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Duke group will log keystrokes on the victim’s machine before securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs include Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging, which is the technique of logging keystrokes. This suggests that the attacker may be interested in collecting additional information from the victim's machine.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting), credential access to an MS Exchange Server (T1078), and email extraction (T1087). After these initial steps, it is likely that the attacker would want to gather more information about the victim's machine and activities, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging.

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs provided, it is likely that the Duke group will log keystrokes on the victim’s machine before securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
