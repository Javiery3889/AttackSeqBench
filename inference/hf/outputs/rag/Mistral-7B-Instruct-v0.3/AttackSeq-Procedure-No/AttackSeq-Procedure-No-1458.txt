 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will create rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing specific words after using spearphishing emails with a PDF attachment to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the technique T1564.008 - Email Hiding Rules, which is a Defense Evasion tactic. This technique involves hiding or disguising emails to evade detection. However, it does not directly relate to creating rules to delete specific emails.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about creating rules to delete emails, which is not a typical sequence after gaining initial access through spearphishing. The TTPs related to Defense Evasion (like T1564.008) are more likely to occur after initial access to evade detection, not to delete emails.

4. Obfuscation techniques to protect sensitive information (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027) might be used after the adversary has gained access and is handling sensitive information, but creating rules to delete specific emails is not a common sequence of TTPs after initial access via spearphishing.

Therefore, the answer is "No". The adversary is not likely to create rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing specific words after using spearphishing emails with a PDF attachment to gain initial access.
