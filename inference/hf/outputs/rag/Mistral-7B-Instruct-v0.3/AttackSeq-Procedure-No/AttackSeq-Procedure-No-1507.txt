 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Resource Development (T1583.008-Malvertising), Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell), and Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, and the related TTPs suggest that the attack starts with Resource Development (Malvertising), followed by Execution (PowerShell), and then Initial Access (Drive-by Compromise). This sequence aligns with the answer choice A: Yes.

In this scenario, RIG EK (a malware family known for its use in malvertising campaigns) delivers exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites. Once the user visits the malicious page, an obfuscated PowerShell script is executed, which then fetches the malware, leading to the Initial Access of the compromised system.
