 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: APT28 is known for spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access. The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will install and execute a VBA script to drop malware like FONTCACHE.DAT before leveraging tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion), which is not directly related to installing or executing a VBA script or dropping FONTCACHE.DAT. However, it is related to techniques used to evade detection, which could be relevant later in the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after APT28 gains initial access. Installing and executing a VBA script to drop FONTCACHE.DAT is not a common TTP for APT28, and there is no evidence in the question or related TTPs to suggest this would be the next step.

4. The tools mentioned in the question (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE) are known to be used for various purposes such as command and control, data exfiltration, and lateral movement. However, they are not typically associated with installing or executing VBA scripts or dropping FONTCACHE.DAT.

Therefore, it is not likely that APT28 will install and execute a VBA script to drop malware like FONTCACHE.DAT before leveraging tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE during their operations.
