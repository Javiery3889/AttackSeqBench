 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about routing traffic over Tor and VPN servers to obfuscate activities for command and control.
2. The related TTPs provided involve techniques for Command and Control, which is the tactic used to maintain an unauthorized presence on a compromised system.
3. Technique T1090-Proxy and T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy are related to using proxies for command and control, which can include Tor and VPN servers.
4. Technique T1071.004-DNS is related to using DNS for command and control, but it does not necessarily involve the use of Tor or VPN servers for obfuscation.
5. Therefore, based on the provided related TTPs, it is more plausible that Earth Lusca would route traffic over Tor and VPN servers to obfuscate their activities for command and control, as option A suggests.
