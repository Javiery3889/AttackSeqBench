 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement after installing additional persistence points and gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already performed the Tactic of Lateral Movement (T1021) and used the Technique of Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210). This suggests that the attacker may indeed exploit remote services for lateral movement after gaining the necessary information during the discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after installing additional persistence points. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker may first gather information (Discovery phase) before moving laterally using exploitation of remote services. This aligns best with answer choice A: Yes.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase. Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
