 Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question is asking if it's likely for the Inner-Loader component of the skip-2.0 backdoor to perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server and employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service after achieving persistence through DLL hijacking.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- The related TTPs suggest that the attack involves Defense Evasion (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking), Privilege Escalation (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking), and Persistence (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking). However, there's no direct mention of process discovery or hooks in MSSQL Server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks about process discovery and hooks in MSSQL Server, which are not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. However, the question does mention that the backdoor achieves persistence through DLL hijacking, which is a technique mentioned in the related TTPs.
- It's possible that the attack could involve process discovery and hooks in MSSQL Server, but without more specific information, it's hard to definitively say whether this is the case.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks if it's likely for the Inner-Loader component to perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server and employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service.
- The related TTPs suggest that the attack involves DLL hijacking for persistence, but do not provide specific information about process discovery or hooks in MSSQL Server.
- Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not possible to definitively say whether it's likely for the Inner-Loader component to perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server and employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
