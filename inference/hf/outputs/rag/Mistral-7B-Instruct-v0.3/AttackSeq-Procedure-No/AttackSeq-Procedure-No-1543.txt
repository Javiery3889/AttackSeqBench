 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will perform discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087 - Process Discovery) after establishing command and control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1021 - Command and Control (C2) Beacon) through Process Hollowing (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1796 - DLL Side-Loading) and achieving persistence (Tactic: Persistence) by creating a RunOnce key in the registry (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the malware is using Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation) and Persistence techniques. However, they do not suggest a specific sequence of TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs where the malware first establishes command and control, then achieves persistence, and finally performs discovery. However, the sequence in the question does not align with the typical sequence of TTPs in a real-world attack. In a typical attack, the malware would first establish persistence to ensure its continued presence on the system, then perform discovery to gather information about the system, and finally establish command and control. Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware will perform discovery after achieving persistence.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is more likely that the malware will perform discovery before achieving persistence, not after. Therefore, the answer is "No".
