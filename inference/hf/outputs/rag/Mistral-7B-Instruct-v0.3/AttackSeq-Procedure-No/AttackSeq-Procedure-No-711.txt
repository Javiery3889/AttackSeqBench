 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that Gallmaker will utilize WindowsRoamingToolsTask and the reverse_tcp payload for execution only after exploiting the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to gain initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion (T1218.011-Rundll32) and Execution (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange). However, the DDE protocol is associated with the Initial Access tactic (T1078), not the Execution tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence of TTPs: Initial Access (DDE) -> Defense Evasion (Rundll32) -> Execution (reverse_tcp payload). However, the related TTPs do not support this sequence, as Rundll32 is a Defense Evasion technique, not Execution. Furthermore, the DDE protocol is not typically used for executing payloads but for data exchange, which is why it is associated with Initial Access.

4. The reverse_tcp payload is a common technique for Execution, but it is not directly related to the DDE protocol or the Gallmaker threat actor. Therefore, it is not likely that Gallmaker will utilize the reverse_tcp payload for execution only after exploiting the DDE protocol.

In conclusion, the answer is "No". Gallmaker is not likely to utilize WindowsRoamingToolsTask and the reverse_tcp payload for execution only after exploiting the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to gain initial access.
