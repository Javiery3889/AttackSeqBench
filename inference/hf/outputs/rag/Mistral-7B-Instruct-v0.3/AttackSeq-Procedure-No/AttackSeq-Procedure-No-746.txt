 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an attack on officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, which started with a spear phishing campaign, will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from a specified IP address.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access to the target system was achieved through spear phishing (T1566.001 and T1566.003). Spear phishing via service (T1566.003) often involves using social media channels to deliver malicious files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files. The related TTPs suggest that this is a likely step in the attack sequence, as T1566.003 specifically mentions the use of social media channels. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".
