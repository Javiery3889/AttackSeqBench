 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Microsoft SharePoint Online (Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002) and has already performed data compression and encryption (implied by the Exfiltration technique T1030, which often involves encrypted data transfer).

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given that the data is already compressed and encrypted, and the size is large (0x1000000 bytes), it is likely that the adversary will divide the files into smaller parts to facilitate their transfer, especially since Microsoft SharePoint Online may have size limits for uploading or downloading files. This process is often referred to as chunking or segmenting. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
