 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that an adversary, after gaining access to a victim's network through compromised remote services, will rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs provided indicate that the adversary has used techniques for Persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task and T1133-External Remote Services) and Execution (T1053.005-Scheduled Task). This suggests that the adversary has gained access, established persistence, and is looking to execute additional malicious activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of events after gaining access. The TTPs provided suggest that the adversary would first establish persistence (T1053.005-Scheduled Task or T1133-External Remote Services) to maintain access to the network, and then use a scheduled task (T1053.005-Scheduled Task) to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon. This sequence aligns best with the question, as the adversary would want to ensure they maintain access before executing further malicious activities.

4. The adversary would likely choose systems with high uptimes (like servers) to create a scheduled task, as these systems are more likely to be running continuously, ensuring the beacon is executed more frequently. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
