 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Raccoon Stealer collected system and account information, crypto wallet data, and received encrypted addresses of C&C servers after communicating with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using multi-stage channels (T1104) for Command and Control, and exfiltrating data over the C2 channel (T1041). This indicates that the attacker is likely to collect and exfiltrate data during the Execution phase, which follows the Command and Control phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions that the attacker communicates with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase, and then collects and exfiltrates data (system, account, and crypto wallet data) during the Execution phase. This sequence aligns with the TTPs provided, as the attacker uses the C2 channel (T1104) for communication and data exfiltration (T1041) during the Command and Control and Execution phases, respectively.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Raccoon Stealer collected system and account information, crypto wallet data, and received encrypted addresses of C&C servers after communicating with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using multi-stage channels (T1104) for Command and Control, and exfiltrating data over the C2 channel (T1041).
   - Based on the question and related TTPs, it is likely that Raccoon Stealer collected system and account information, crypto wallet data during the Execution phase, and then made network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
