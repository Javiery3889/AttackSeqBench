 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the XAgent component communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server to receive commands via the HTTPChannel module only after sending a hello message, following the InfoOS module gathering system information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs involve Exfiltration and Discovery tactics. T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel are Exfiltration techniques, which suggest that data collection or exfiltration activities may occur after system information is gathered. However, there is no mention of a "hello message" in these TTPs. T1082-System Information Discovery is a Discovery technique, which aligns with the InfoOS module's activity of gathering system information.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not explicitly mention a "hello message" in the sequence of TTPs. The related TTPs suggest that data exfiltration or communication with the C&C server may occur after system information is gathered, but they do not specify the order of events, such as sending a "hello message" before communication. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not necessarily include sending a "hello message" before communicating with the C&C server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the XAgent component communicates with its C&C server to receive commands via the HTTPChannel module only after sending a hello message.
   - The related TTPs suggest that data exfiltration or communication with the C&C server may occur after system information is gathered, but they do not specify the order of events, such as sending a "hello message" before communication.
   - Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the XAgent component sends a "hello message" before communicating with its C&C server.
   - Final Answer: No.
