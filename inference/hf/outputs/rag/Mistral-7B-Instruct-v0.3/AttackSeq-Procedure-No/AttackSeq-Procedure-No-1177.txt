 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FoggyWeb, a known data exfiltration technique, is likely to passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery (T1040) with Network Sniffing, Command and Control (T1071.001) with Web Protocols, and Collection (T1560) with Archive via Custom Method. These TTPs suggest that the attacker is actively monitoring network traffic, communicating with a C2 server, and collecting data using custom methods.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question suggests a sequence where FoggyWeb exfiltrates sensitive data first, then starts monitoring HTTP requests. However, the related TTPs indicate that the attacker is actively monitoring network traffic (T1040-Network Sniffing) before exfiltrating data, which contradicts the sequence proposed in the question. Therefore, it is unlikely that FoggyWeb would passively monitor HTTP requests after exfiltrating sensitive data.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the answer is "No". FoggyWeb is not likely to passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.
