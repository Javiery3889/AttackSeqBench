 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK's exploit server will use domain fronting for its command and control operations after using proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using proxy servers (T1090) and domain fronting (T1090.004) for command and control operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The use of proxy servers (T1090) is a technique to make infections harder to detect by routing traffic through intermediary servers. Domain fronting (T1090.004) is a specific method of disguising the destination of network traffic by making it appear as if it is going to another server hosted in the same Content Delivery Network (CDN). Both techniques serve the purpose of obfuscating the attacker's command and control infrastructure. Therefore, it is plausible that RIG EK's exploit server would use domain fronting after using proxy servers to further hide its command and control operations.
