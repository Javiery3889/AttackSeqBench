 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if FIN13, after using WMI for lateral movement, is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that FIN13 has been known to use T1003.001-LSASS Memory, which is a technique under the Credential Access tactic. This suggests that FIN13 is likely to gather credentials through memory dumping LSASS.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after WMI lateral movement. The most plausible sequence would be:
   - WMI lateral movement (T1020) to move across the network.
   - T1003.001-LSASS Memory to gather credentials.
   - Once credentials are obtained, FIN13 is likely to use T1056.001-Scripting to execute scripts and T1056.003-PowerShell for executing commands on the compromised system. These TTPs fall under the Tactic: Execution and Tactic: Command and Control.
   - T1086.001-PowerShell Empire for establishing a reverse shell, which is a form of T1055.001-Remote Access Tools.
   - T1087-System Information Discovery, where FIN13 can use native OS binaries and scripts to gather information on user accounts, as part of their internal reconnaissance.

4. The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is: WMI lateral movement (T1020) -> T1003.001-LSASS Memory -> T1056.001-Scripting/T1056.003-PowerShell -> T1087-System Information Discovery. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
