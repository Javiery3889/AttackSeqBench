 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques for Execution (T1203) and Defense Evasion (T1070.004). However, T1107 (File Deletion) is a Defense Evasion technique, not Execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after stealing credentials. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker might exploit a vulnerability (T1203) for client execution, but there is no indication that they would perform file deletion as a defense evasion technique before this exploitation.

4. Conclusion: Given the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction. Therefore, the answer is "No".
