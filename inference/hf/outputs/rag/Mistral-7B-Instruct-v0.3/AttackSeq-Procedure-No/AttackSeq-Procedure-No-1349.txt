 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Discovery phase, specifically focusing on the Exfiltration and Collection phases. The question does not mention RSA and AES encryption algorithms in the Exfiltration phase.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Exfiltration and Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which suggests that data is sent to a Command and Control (C&C) server. However, there is no mention of customized encoding or RSA and AES encryption algorithms in these TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the Collection phase (Tactic: Collection) or the use of RSA and AES encryption algorithms in the Exfiltration phase. The callCam app is more likely to send the collected data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase, as suggested by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it would encrypt the data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include encrypting the data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Exfiltration phase. The data is more likely to be sent to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine, as suggested by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, and potentially encrypted during the Collection phase, but the question does not provide enough information to confirm this.
