 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that DNSpionage attackers conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers before employing password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention Reconnaissance (T1589) and Initial Access (T1566.001). However, there is no mention of Surveillance or any TTPs related to Microsoft Office documents or password-protected macros.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about a sequence of events leading to the use of password-protected macros in Microsoft Office documents. The related TTPs do not provide any evidence that this sequence occurred. In fact, the TTPs mentioned (Reconnaissance and Initial Access) are typically the first steps in an attack, not the ones that follow.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is not likely that DNSpionage attackers conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers before employing password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents to evade detection. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
