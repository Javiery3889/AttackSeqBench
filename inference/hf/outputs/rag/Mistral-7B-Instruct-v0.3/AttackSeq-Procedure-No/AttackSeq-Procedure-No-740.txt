 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are using techniques for Initial Access, specifically T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1189-Drive-by Compromise. These techniques suggest that the attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly-facing applications or delivering malware through compromised websites.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the likelihood of the attackers breaching MSPs to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands. This action aligns with the Tactic of Initial Access, which is already established in the related TTPs. By breaching MSPs, the attackers can gain access to multiple clients, allowing them to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands more efficiently.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
