 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the malware determined the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security, which suggests that the malware has already established a foothold in the system (Discovery Tactic).
2. The malware then chose its installation method accordingly, indicating that it wants to persist in the system (Persistence Tactic).
3. The use of dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection (T1571.001 and T1499) is a common method for maintaining persistence and evading detection, but it is not necessarily the next step after discovering security software.
4. Collection Tactic (T1041, T1005, etc.) would typically come after Persistence, as the attacker would want to gather information about the system before moving on to other tactics.
5. Defense Evasion Tactic (T1565, T1572, etc.) is also a common tactic for maintaining persistence, but it is not specifically mentioned in the question as the next step after the malware chose its installation method.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is Discovery (T1518.001 or T1497) -> Persistence (T1077) -> Defense Evasion (T1565, T1572, etc.) -> Dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques (T1571.001 and T1499). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the malware chose its installation method, the answer is Persistence.
