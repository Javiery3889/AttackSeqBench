 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next after configuring the command-and-control infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has set up a command-and-control infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server (T1090-Proxy) and possibly used multi-hop proxies (T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy). This suggests that the attacker is establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system and potentially other systems within the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Lateral Movement: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not the final stage of the attack as described in the question. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the command-and-control infrastructure was set up, not a tactic that would follow after that.

   - B: Command and Control: This tactic involves establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system. Given that the attacker has set up a command-and-control infrastructure, it is likely that this tactic occurred next as the final stage of the attack.

   - C: Credential Access: This tactic involves obtaining, modifying, or using credentials to access resources. While it could be a preliminary step to set up the command-and-control infrastructure, it is not the final stage of the attack as described in the question.

   - D: Exfiltration: This tactic involves exfiltrating data from the compromised system. This is likely a subsequent step after the attacker has established command and control and potentially moved laterally within the network to find valuable data. However, it is not the final stage of the attack as described in the question, which asks for the tactic that occurred after the command-and-control infrastructure was set up.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Command and Control (T1090-Proxy, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy)
   - (Possibly) Tactic: Lateral Movement (T1021-Remote Desktop Protocol, T1022-Remote Access Software, etc.)
   - Tactic: Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel, T1005-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, etc.)
