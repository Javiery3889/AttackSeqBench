 Final Answer: A: Resource Development

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before cybercriminals developed and sold hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access (T1195.003) and Resource Development (T1588.001, T1587.001) tactics were involved.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access (T1195.003) is about gaining unauthorized access to a system. However, it doesn't necessarily lead to the development of hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.
   - Command and Control (T1086) is about establishing communication with compromised systems, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and doesn't directly relate to the development of hardware.
   - Exfiltration (T1041) is about stealing data from a compromised system, which is also a later stage in the attack lifecycle and doesn't directly relate to the development of hardware.
   - Resource Development (T1587.001, T1588.001) is about establishing a capability for future attacks, which includes developing malware. Malware can be used to control the skimmers once they are in the wild, but it can also be used in the development phase to ensure the skimmers are compromised and can be controlled.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the development of hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access and Resource Development tactics were involved.
   - Resource Development (T1587.001, T1588.001) is about establishing a capability for future attacks, which includes developing malware. This tactic is most likely to have occurred before the development of the hardware, as the malware could be used to ensure the skimmers are compromised and can be controlled. Therefore, the final answer is A: Resource Development.
