 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Hi-Zor RAT created a copy of itself and entrenched in the registry run key with 'regsvr32.exe'.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the tactics of Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation, and Persistence.
3. The Defense Evasion tactic is related to the technique used to hide the malware (T1218.010-Regsvr32), but it doesn't necessarily imply persistence.
4. The Privilege Escalation tactic is not directly related to the action of creating a copy of the malware and setting it to run on startup.
5. The Persistence tactic, specifically Technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder, is the most relevant as it involves setting a malware to run on system startup, which is what happened when the Hi-Zor RAT was entrenched in the registry run key with 'regsvr32.exe'.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Defense Evasion (T1218.010-Regsvr32) followed by Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
