 Final Answer: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. FastPOS's RAM scraper verified credit card information for theft and ensured cards were suitable for international use. This action falls under the Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System.
2. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the stolen data was transmitted to a hardcoded server using GET commands over unencrypted communication.
3. From the related TTPs, we see that Tactic: Exfiltration is mentioned twice, with Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel and T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol.
4. Since the stolen data is being transmitted over unencrypted communication, T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol seems to be the most relevant technique in this context.
5. T1048.003 is a sub-technique of Tactic: Exfiltration.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Collection (T1005) -> Exfiltration (T1048.003).
