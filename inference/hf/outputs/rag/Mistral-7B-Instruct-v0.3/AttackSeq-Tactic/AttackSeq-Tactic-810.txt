 Final Answer: C: Resource Development

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that LYCEUM gained access to passwords stored in RDCMan configuration files and account details from Active Directory. This indicates that the Tactic of Credential Access has been initiated.
2. The related TTPs also confirm the Credential Access tactic, with T1003.003-NTDS and T1555-Credentials from Password Stores being techniques under this tactic.
3. After gaining access to credentials, the attacker would typically use these credentials to move laterally within the network, which is a part of the Resource Development tactic. This tactic involves establishing and expanding access to resources.
4. Spearphishing operations, as mentioned in the question, are a part of the Initial Access tactic. However, since the attacker already has access to the network through the stolen credentials, it is more likely that the Resource Development tactic occurred before the spearphishing operations.
5. The Defense Evasion tactic is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. The Command and Control tactic is not relevant as it typically involves establishing a communication channel with the compromised system, which comes later in the attack sequence. The Discovery tactic is also not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
