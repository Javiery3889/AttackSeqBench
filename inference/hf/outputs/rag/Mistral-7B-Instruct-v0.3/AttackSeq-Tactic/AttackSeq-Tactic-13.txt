 Final Answer: Collection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites to distribute "Machete" malware.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic was used through spear-phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) and fake blog websites (T1189-Drive-by Compromise). This means the attackers have gained access to the target system.
3. After Initial Access, the next logical step in an attack sequence would be to collect data from the compromised system. This is indicated by the Tactic: Collection in the related TTPs.
4. The tactic Persistence is about maintaining access to a compromised system, which would typically occur after Collection, not immediately after Initial Access.
5. Reconnaissance is about gathering information about the target before an attack, not after.
6. Therefore, the most plausible answer is Collection.
