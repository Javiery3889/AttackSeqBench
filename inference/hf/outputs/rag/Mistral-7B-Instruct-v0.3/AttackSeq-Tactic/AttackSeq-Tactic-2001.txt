 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Sebdraven exploited CVE-2017_1882 to drop files, but it does not indicate any collection or initial access activities.
2. The related TTPs list two persistence techniques (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading and T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking). These techniques are used to maintain access to a compromised system after initial access has been gained.
3. Execution is a tactic that involves running a command or a script, but it does not necessarily imply persistence. In this case, the question mentions that iassvcs.exe was executed, but it does not specify whether this was done to ensure persistence.
4. Collection and Initial Access tactics are not directly related to the actions described in the question or the related TTPs.
5. Given that the question mentions the persistence techniques T1574.002 and T1574.008, and the dropped files could be used for further malicious activities, it is most likely that the attacker would want to ensure persistence on the compromised system before moving on to other tactics such as collection or execution.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (not explicitly mentioned in the question) -> Execution (iassvcs.exe was executed) -> Persistence (T1574.002 or T1574.008 was used to ensure persistence). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the drop of the files, so the final answer is Persistence.
