 Final Answer: Command and Control (B)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Trickbot gathered credentials and application information, and used psfin32 and shadnewdll modules for PoS data extraction and modification of web traffic.

2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie, T1552.001-Credentials In Files, and T1003-OS Credential Dumping are all related to Credential Access tactics. This suggests that the attacker is interested in gathering and maintaining access to the compromised system.

3. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial credential access and data extraction. The Command and Control tactic (T1071) is the next logical step, as it involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, allowing the attacker to issue commands and further execute their malicious activities.

4. The other answer choices do not seem to be the most plausible sequence of events after the initial credential access and data extraction. Collection (A) and Discovery (D) tactics could have occurred before the initial credential access, while Credential Access (C) has already been established as the initial tactic in this scenario.
