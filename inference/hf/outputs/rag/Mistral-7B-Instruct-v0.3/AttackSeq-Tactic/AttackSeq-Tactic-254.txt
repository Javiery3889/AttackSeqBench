 Final Answer: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The Syrian Malware Team developed BlackWorm RAT with advanced capabilities to disable analysis tools and bypass UAC, which falls under the Defense Evasion tactic (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control).
2. The malware then performed Privilege Escalation to gain higher access levels, as indicated by the related Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control. However, this is not the tactic that occurred after the initial development and before the malware established communication channels.
3. The malware did not need to access credentials at this stage, as it already had the necessary privileges to bypass UAC and perform Privilege Escalation. Therefore, Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access) is not the most likely tactic that occurred after the development and before the establishment of communication channels.
4. The malware did not execute commands like DDoS or download files at this stage, as these actions are part of the Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) phase. Therefore, Execution (Tactic: Execution) is not the most likely tactic that occurred after the development and before the establishment of communication channels.
5. The malware had to evade detection and analysis before it could establish communication channels, which is the purpose of the Defense Evasion tactic. Therefore, Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) is the most likely tactic that occurred after the development and before the establishment of communication channels.
