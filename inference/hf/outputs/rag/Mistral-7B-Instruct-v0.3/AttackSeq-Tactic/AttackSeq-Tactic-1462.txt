 Final Answer: B: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the threat actors executed the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic, which is the tactic used when the malware is executed on the targeted workstations.
3. However, to execute the malware, the threat actors must first gain access to the targeted workstations. This is the Initial Access tactic.
4. Enabling macros in weaponized MS Office documents is a technique under the Initial Access tactic (T1192).
5. Therefore, the Initial Access tactic is the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
