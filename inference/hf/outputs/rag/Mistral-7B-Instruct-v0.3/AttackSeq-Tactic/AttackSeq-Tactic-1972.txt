 Final Answer: Command and Control (C)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Elfin extracted credentials using DarkComet and before data was exfiltrated using the custom AutoIt FTP tool FastUploader.

2. The related TTPs provided mention the Exfiltration tactic, specifically T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol, which are techniques used for data exfiltration.

3. To exfiltrate data, an attacker needs to establish a communication channel, often through Command and Control (C2) servers. This is typically done after gaining access to the system (Credential Access or Initial Access) and maintaining persistence on the system (Persistence).

4. In this case, Elfin has already extracted credentials and gained access to the system. Therefore, it is most likely that the attacker would set up a C2 channel before exfiltrating the data, making Command and Control the most plausible tactic that occurred between the two given events.
