 Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the most likely tactic that occurred next after attackers propagated beacons to other systems within the company's network. The question mentions ADFind and port scanning, which are discovery techniques used to gather network information.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention two discovery tactics (T1018 and T1016), which align with the network information gathering mentioned in the question. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next, not the one that was initially used.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The two discovery tactics (T1018 and T1016) are used to gather information about the network and systems. After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network (Tactic: T1021-Lateral Movement) to spread the beacons to other systems. The execution (Tactic: T1055) or defense evasion (Tactic: T1027) tactics are not directly related to propagating beacons to other systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next after attackers propagated beacons to other systems within the company's network.
   - The related TTPs mention discovery tactics, but the question asks for the next tactic, not the initial one.
   - After gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning, the most logical next step would be to move laterally within the network (Tactic: T1021-Lateral Movement) to spread the beacons to other systems. Therefore, the final answer is D: Lateral Movement.
