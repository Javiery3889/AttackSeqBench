 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before APT10 achieved persistence on victim networks.
2. The related TTPs mention the technique T1053.005 (Scheduled Task) and T1053.002 (At), which are persistence techniques. This indicates that APT10 had already established persistence on the victim network.
3. To achieve persistence, an attacker must first gain access to the network, which is the Initial Access tactic (T1078).
4. The question also mentions the deployment of malware such as PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access. These are techniques under the Command and Control (T1071) tactic, which is a post-Initial Access tactic.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (T1078) followed by Command and Control (T1071) to deploy the malware, and then Persistence (T1053) to maintain access to the network.
6. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the persistence, the answer is Initial Access (D).
