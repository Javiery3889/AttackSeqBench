 Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the Darkhotel APT gained initial access.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the technique T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location, which is associated with the Reconnaissance tactic. This technique involves using legitimate services or software to gather information about a target, which aligns with the question's requirement of obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The other answer choices do not directly relate to obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts. Resource Development (A) is about building and maintaining the capabilities, infrastructure, and resources needed for an operation. Command and Control (D) is about maintaining persistence and managing the compromised system. Initial Access (C) is about the first step an attacker takes to gain access to a system, but it does not necessarily involve obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

4. Conclusion: Based on the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Reconnaissance (B) to gather information about the victims' whereabouts, followed by Initial Access (C) to gain access to the system. Therefore, the final answer is B: Reconnaissance.
