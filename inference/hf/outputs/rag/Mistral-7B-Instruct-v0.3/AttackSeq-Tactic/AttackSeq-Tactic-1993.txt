 Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The Lazarus group has already achieved persistence by registering loader-type malware for auto-execution, which falls under the Persistence tactic (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.002-At).
2. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before they harvested credentials using the Responder tool.
3. The related TTPs provided (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing and Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay) are all related to Credential Access tactics. However, these techniques are used to gain access to credentials, not to move laterally within a network.
4. The only tactic left is Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement), which is the tactic that occurs after persistence and before credential harvesting, as it allows the attacker to move within the network to reach the systems where the credentials are stored.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Persistence (T1053.002-At) -> Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement) -> Credential Access (T1040-Network Sniffing, T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay).
