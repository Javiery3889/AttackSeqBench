 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used the Explosive Trojan to spread manually across the network.
2. The Explosive Trojan (T1021.002) is a technique under the Lateral Movement tactic, which involves moving within a network from an initial foothold.
3. The attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread, indicating they are moving laterally within the network.
4. The related TTPs also support the Lateral Movement tactic, with T1021.002 being the specific technique used and T1570 being another technique under Lateral Movement (Lateral Tool Transfer).
5. There is no indication in the question or related TTPs that the attackers gained Initial Access (A) or Command and Control (C) after using the Explosive Trojan, nor is there a mention of Execution (D) as a likely next step.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1091) -> Initial Access (T1021.002) -> Lateral Movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares or T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer) -> Lateral Movement (B).
