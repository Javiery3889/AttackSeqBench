 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Earth Wendigo established a WebSocket connection to control a JavaScript backdoor and read emails from the webmail server. This action suggests that the attacker is communicating with the compromised system and executing commands, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
2. The related TTPs also indicate the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001), which is a technique often used in Command and Control activities.
3. The Execution tactic (T1059) is related to the initial compromise of a system, not the ongoing communication and control of the compromised system.
4. Lateral Movement (T1021) and Exfiltration (T1041) are tactics that typically occur after the attacker has established a foothold and gained access to the network, and they involve moving within the network and stealing data, respectively. However, in this case, the question specifically mentions reading emails from the webmail server, which is more indicative of Command and Control activities rather than Lateral Movement or Exfiltration.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access (T1078) to compromise the system
   - Command and Control (T1071) to establish a WebSocket connection and control the JavaScript backdoor
   - Command and Control (T1071) to read emails from the webmail server.

In conclusion, the most likely tactic that followed the establishment of the WebSocket connection and reading of emails is Command and Control (A: Command and Control).
