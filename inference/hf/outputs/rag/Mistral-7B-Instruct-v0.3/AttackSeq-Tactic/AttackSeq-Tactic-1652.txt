 Final Answer: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of njRAT malware and the collection of Kavach authentication databases, which indicates the use of Credential Access (Tactic) and T1555.003 (Technique) for credential harvesting.
2. SideCopy using modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing further supports the Credential Access Tactic.
3. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after these actions.
4. The Tactic: Initial Access (T1078) would have occurred before the deployment of the njRAT malware, as it is the process of gaining access to a system.
5. The Tactic: Command and Control (T1071) would be ongoing, as it is the maintenance of the connection between the attacker and the compromised system.
6. The Tactic: Impact (T1087) could potentially occur after credential harvesting, but it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data, which is the focus of the question.
7. The Tactic: Exfiltration (T1041) is the most likely answer, as it involves the theft of data from a compromised system, which would be the next logical step after credential harvesting and the collection of Kavach authentication databases.
