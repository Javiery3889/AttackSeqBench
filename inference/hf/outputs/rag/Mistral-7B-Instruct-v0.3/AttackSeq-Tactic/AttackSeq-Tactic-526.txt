 Final Answer: Tactic: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used images in phishing emails. The question also mentions that the attackers bypassed Google's security systems and included hidden tracking images in emails to monitor if targets opened them.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used phishing techniques (T1566-Phishing and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) for Initial Access. The Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link is also related, as it suggests that the attackers used a spearphishing link for reconnaissance purposes. However, it does not necessarily imply that this occurred before the phishing email with hidden tracking images was sent.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The tactic of Initial Access is the most likely to have occurred before the attackers used images in phishing emails. This is because Initial Access refers to the first step in an attack, where the attacker gains access to a system. The use of phishing emails and links is a common method for Initial Access. The other tactics (Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement) are more about maintaining access, moving within a system, or increasing privileges, which typically occur after Initial Access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used images in phishing emails.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used phishing techniques for Initial Access.
   - The tactic of Initial Access is the first step in an attack, making it the most likely to have occurred before the phishing email with hidden tracking images was sent.
   - Final Answer: Tactic: Initial Access.
