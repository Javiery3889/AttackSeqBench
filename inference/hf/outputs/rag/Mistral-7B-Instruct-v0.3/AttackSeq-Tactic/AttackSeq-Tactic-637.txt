 Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
2. The related TTPs indicate that GreyEnergy initially accessed the network through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) and spearphishing (T1566.002).
3. To strategically target specific systems like ICS control workstations, the attackers would need to gather information about their target environment. This is typically done through the Reconnaissance tactic.
4. Collection and Command and Control tactics are more related to data gathering and maintaining communication with compromised systems, respectively, which come after the initial targeting phase.
5. Resource Development is not directly related to the initial targeting of specific systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Reconnaissance (to gather information about the target environment)
- Initial Access (through spearphishing and exploiting public-facing applications)
- Command and Control (to maintain communication with compromised systems)

However, since the question asks for the tactic that informed the strategic targeting, the answer is Reconnaissance.
