 Final Answer: B: Collection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign utilized process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery through the SombRAT backdoor. These TTPs are all part of the Discovery tactic (Tactic: Discovery, Techniques: T1057-Process Discovery, T1083-File and Directory Discovery, T1140-System Time Discovery).
2. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after these Discovery TTPs.
3. The Discovery tactic is used to gather information about the target environment. Once the attacker has this information, they can move on to the next phase of the attack, which is typically the Collection tactic (Tactic: Collection).
4. The Collection tactic involves the gathering of data from the target environment for future use. In this case, the attacker archived the gathered information using a custom storage file format, which is a typical action in the Collection phase.
5. The other answer choices do not align as well with the sequence of events described in the question. Initial Access (A) refers to the first phase of an attack, where the attacker gains access to the target system. Resource Development (C) refers to the creation or acquisition of tools, infrastructure, or capabilities for future attacks. Discovery (D) is the tactic that the CostaRicto Campaign was already performing before the question's events.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Discovery (T1057, T1083, T1140) -> Collection (archiving the gathered information). The answer is B: Collection.
