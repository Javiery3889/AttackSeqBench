 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that a server of a South Korean software company has been compromised. This implies that the attacker has gained access to the system, which falls under the Initial Access tactic.
2. The attacker then distributes a trojaned update file, which is a form of Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after compromising the server, not the tactic that led to the distribution of the malicious file.
3. The question does not mention any data exfiltration (Exfiltration), so that tactic can be ruled out.
4. Privilege Escalation (A) is a tactic used to gain higher-level access to a system, but it is not the tactic that occurs immediately after initial access. It is usually employed after the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system.
5. Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred after compromising the server is Initial Access (C), as it is the first step in the attack chain and sets the stage for the distribution of the malicious file and subsequent use of the malicious payload.
