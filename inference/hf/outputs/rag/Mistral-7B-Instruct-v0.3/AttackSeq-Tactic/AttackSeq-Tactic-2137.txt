 Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that APT15 gained domain administrator credentials and used Mimikatz for privilege escalation. This action falls under the Privilege Escalation tactic (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002).
2. After gaining higher privileges, they enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor. This action is aimed at bypassing policy settings that disable command prompt execution, which is a Defense Evasion technique (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002).
3. The related TTPs also mention the bypass of User Account Control, which is a sub-technique of both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely followed the enabling of the RoyalCLI backdoor, and the action of bypassing policy settings to enable the backdoor is more closely related to Defense Evasion.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Privilege Escalation (T1548.002) -> Defense Evasion (T1548.002).
