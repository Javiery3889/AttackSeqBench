 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after reconnaissance through phishing domains and before establishing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack group conducted reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information) and that they used spearphishing links for this reconnaissance (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
3. The Initial Access tactic involves gaining unauthorized access to a system, which is a logical next step after gathering victim identity information (reconnaissance) and before establishing persistence on the victim system.
4. Credential Access, Persistence, and Reconnaissance tactics do not fit the sequence described in the question as they do not follow the order of reconnaissance, initial access, and persistence.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Reconnaissance (T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information) -> Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) -> Persistence (Tactic not specified in the question, but it would be the next logical step after Initial Access).
