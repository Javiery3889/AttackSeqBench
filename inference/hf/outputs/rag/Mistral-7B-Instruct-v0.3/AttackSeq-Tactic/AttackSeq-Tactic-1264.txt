 Final Answer: D: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have established command and control (Tactic: Command and Control) using a self-developed backdoor named 'POWSSHNET' for RDP over SSH tunneling. This is an initial step in maintaining persistence and communication with the compromised system.

2. The use of reverse proxy tools like Ngrok and FRP (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling) is employed to further secure and obfuscate the command and control channel.

3. The attackers then manually selected and compressed valuable intelligence into archives using WinRAR or 7-zip (Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.001-Archive via Utility). This step involves gathering and preparing data for exfiltration.

4. Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration) is the most plausible tactic that follows the sequence of events described in the question, as it involves the transfer of the compressed data (the valuable intelligence) from the compromised system to the attacker's control. The other tactics (Command and Control, Credential Access, Execution) do not directly follow the sequence of events described in the question.
