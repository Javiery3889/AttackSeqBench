 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker has already performed Collection (T1005) to gather system information and Exfiltration (T1041) to send stolen data over the C2 channel.
3. The Tactic: Collection and Tactic: Exfiltration have already occurred, but they do not directly facilitate communication with the C&C server.
4. The remaining tactic, Command and Control (T1053), is the most plausible answer as it involves the establishment of a C2 channel for communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
5. The technique T1113 (Screen Capture) is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server, but it could be a part of the collection process, which has already been performed.
6. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: Command and Control.
