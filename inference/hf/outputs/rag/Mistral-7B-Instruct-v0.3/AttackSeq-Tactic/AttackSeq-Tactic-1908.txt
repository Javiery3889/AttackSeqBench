 Final Answer: D: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when malicious scripts were injected into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
2. The related TTPs mention Tactic: Collection (T1185-Browser Session Hijacking) and Tactic: Impact (T1657-Financial Theft). However, Tactic: Collection is more related to the initial gathering of data, while Tactic: Impact is about the effect of the attack (financial theft in this case).
3. Tactic: Resource Development (T1608.004-Drive-by Target) is not directly related to the injection of malicious scripts or the exfiltration of data.
4. The TTP T1185-Browser Session Hijacking is related to the interception of data, but it is more about hijacking active sessions rather than injecting malicious scripts.
5. Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before funneling stolen customer data is Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Data Staged). This tactic is about stealing data and moving it out of the compromised system, which aligns with the injection of malicious scripts to intercept transactional data.
