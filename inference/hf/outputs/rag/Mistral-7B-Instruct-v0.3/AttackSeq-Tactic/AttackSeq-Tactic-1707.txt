 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that a phishing email delivered a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro, which is an initial step in an attack chain. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this initial access.
2. The related TTPs include techniques for Initial Access (T1566.001 and T1566.002), which align with the phishing email delivery. But the question asks for a tactic that occurred after the initial access.
3. The only remaining tactic in the answer choices is Execution (T1059), and the related TTPs do not specify any other tactic that should have occurred before the use of 'mshta.exe' tool.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566.001 or T1566.002) -> Execution (T1059.005). The malware using 'mshta.exe' tool to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL would then be part of the Execution phase.
