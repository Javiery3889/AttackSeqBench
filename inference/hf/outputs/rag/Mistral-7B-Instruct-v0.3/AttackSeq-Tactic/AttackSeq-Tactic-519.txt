 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the Rising Sun implant established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests, which aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols.
2. The question also mentions that the implant is sending encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers, which is a common activity in the Command and Control phase of an attack.
3. The Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is related but involves moving data out of the compromised system, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question as the next step after establishing communication.
4. The Tactic: Resource Development is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
5. The Tactic: Execution is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question, as it typically refers to the initial execution of malware or exploits, which has already occurred in this scenario (the Rising Sun implant has already been established).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
1. Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078)
2. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001)
3. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-Data from Lived Off the Land) (This could be the step where the implant starts sending data to the control servers)
4. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols) (This is the step where the implant establishes communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests)
5. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.003-C2 Beacon) (This could be the step where the implant sends encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers)
6. Potential next steps could include Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) or Persistence (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053-File and Directory Modifications).
