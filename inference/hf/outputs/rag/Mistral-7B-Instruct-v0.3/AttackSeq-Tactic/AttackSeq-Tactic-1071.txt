 Final Answer: B: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the next tactic after exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
2. The related TTPs mention the tactics of Privilege Escalation and Persistence.
3. The technique T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is not directly related to Resource Development or Exfiltration.
4. The technique T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder is a method used for achieving persistence on a compromised system.
5. Therefore, adding a Run registry key to achieve a foothold is more likely to be part of the Persistence tactic rather than Resource Development, Exfiltration, or Privilege Escalation.
