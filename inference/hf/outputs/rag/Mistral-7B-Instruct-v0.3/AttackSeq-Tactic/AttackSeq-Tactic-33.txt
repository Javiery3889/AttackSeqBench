 Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access tactic was used, specifically T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment. This technique is often used after some form of reconnaissance to identify potential targets and their vulnerabilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the Initial Access tactic. Given that Reconnaissance is the tactic that typically precedes Initial Access, it is the most plausible answer.

4. Conclusion: The final answer is B: Reconnaissance. This is because the adversary would have likely conducted reconnaissance to gather information about the target systems and their potential vulnerabilities before sending the phishing emails with the malicious Word documents.
