 Final Answer: D: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the creation of a PE file and setting up a scheduled task for its operation, which aligns with Technique T1053.005 - Scheduled Task.
2. This technique is related to the Tactic of Execution and Persistence. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to ensure the malware remains active.
3. The Tactic of Execution is about running code, but it doesn't necessarily ensure the malware remains active over time.
4. The Tactic of Resource Development is about building resources for future operations, which doesn't directly ensure the malware remains active.
5. The Tactic of Command and Control is about maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised system, but it doesn't ensure the malware remains active.
6. The Tactic of Persistence is about maintaining access to a compromised system, and setting up a scheduled task to run the malware every minute is a common method to achieve persistence.
7. Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred to ensure the malware remains active is Persistence (D).
