 Final Answer: A: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to maintain the Meterpreter session on the compromised system.
2. The Meterpreter session is a persistent backdoor that allows the attacker to maintain access to the compromised system.
3. The attacker has already achieved Initial Access (through the Metasploit shellcode) and Privilege Escalation (using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll) but the question asks for a tactic that maintains the session, not establishes it.
4. Exfiltration is not related to maintaining a session, it is about transferring data out of the compromised system.
5. Privilege Escalation is about gaining higher privileges, not maintaining a session.
6. The related TTP T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location is a Defense Evasion technique, which could be used to hide the Meterpreter session, but it does not maintain the session.
7. The related TTP T1055-Process Injection and T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation are techniques used for Privilege Escalation, not for maintaining a session.
8. The only remaining tactic is Persistence, which is about maintaining access to the compromised system, specifically by creating a mechanism that allows the attacker to regain access even if the initial entry point is removed or blocked.
9. Since the Meterpreter session is a persistent backdoor, the attacker would likely use a Persistence technique to maintain the session on the compromised system.
