 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question describes Derusbi, a malware known for its data exfiltration capabilities.
2. The question mentions that Derusbi gathers host information and transfers it back via network beacons. This is a typical behavior of Command and Control (C2) communication, where the malware sends data back to the attacker's server.
3. The question then states that Derusbi binds to a random source port and communicates with the preconfigured destination port 443. This is a common technique used in C2 communication to evade detection, as it uses a non-standard port (random source port) to connect to a standard port (destination port 443) often used for secure web traffic (HTTPS).
4. The related TTPs list includes the Tactic: Command and Control, which further supports the conclusion that the most likely tactic after Derusbi gathers host information and communicates via network beacons is Command and Control.
5. The other answer choices (Collection, Privilege Escalation, Discovery) do not align as well with the given scenario, as they do not involve the described C2 communication behavior.
