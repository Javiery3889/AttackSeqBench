 Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the delivery of Gh0st RAT via email, which is an Execution (T1055) technique. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely involved embedding a functional game to avoid detection. The Execution tactic does not directly involve this action.

2. The question also mentions the establishment of command-and-control infrastructure, which is a Command and Control (T1056) tactic. However, this tactic is performed after the initial compromise and does not involve embedding a game to avoid detection.

3. The question also mentions the use of a multi-stage channel (T1104), which is a Command and Control tactic. However, this tactic is also performed after the initial compromise and does not involve embedding a game to avoid detection.

4. The question also mentions the use of domains for command-and-control (T1105), which is a Command and Control tactic. However, this tactic is also performed after the initial compromise and does not involve embedding a game to avoid detection.

5. The question asks for the tactic that most likely involved embedding a functional game to avoid detection. The only tactic that could potentially fit this description is Defense Evasion (T1027), which involves techniques to hide the presence of an adversary or their activities. Embedding a functional game like Tetris to avoid detection is a common technique under T1027.001 - Obfuscated Files or Information.

6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Execution (T1055) to deliver the malware, followed by Defense Evasion (T1027) to embed a functional game to avoid detection, and then Command and Control (T1056) to establish the command-and-control infrastructure.
