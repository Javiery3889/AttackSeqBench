 Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Stuxnet used rootkit functionality for hiding its presence (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit).
2. Stuxnet also used stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers for evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing).
3. The question mentions the exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services).
4. The sequence of TTPs suggests that Stuxnet first employed defense evasion techniques to hide its presence and use legitimate-looking code, then exploited vulnerabilities to move laterally across the networked systems.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion (T1014-Rootkit, T1553.002-Code Signing) followed by Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services).
6. Execution (Tactic: Execution) and Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) are not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
