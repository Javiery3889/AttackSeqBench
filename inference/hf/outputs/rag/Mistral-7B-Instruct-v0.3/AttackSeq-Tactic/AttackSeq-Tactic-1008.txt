 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the 'Persistence' module group planted a plugin in popular applications to regain access to the target machine.
2. The related TTPs all fall under the 'Persistence' tactic, which is about maintaining access to a compromised system. However, the question asks for a tactic that occurred before the persistence stage.
3. The 'Initial Access' tactic is about gaining the first foothold into a system. Once the initial access is gained, the attacker can then move laterally and establish persistence on the system.
4. The techniques mentioned in the related TTPs (T1547.006, T1574.001, T1547) are all persistence techniques, which means they are used after the initial access has been gained.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access -> Establishing a foothold -> Maintaining Persistence (as described in the question).
6. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the persistence stage, the answer is D: Initial Access.
