 Final Answer: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Deep Panda employed the Fire Chili rootkit. The rootkit is a Defense Evasion technique (T1564.001) used to hide malicious artifacts, files, processes, and network connections.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention two Defense Evasion techniques (T1564.001 and T1014). However, the question asks for a tactic that occurred before the use of the rootkit, not a specific technique.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The tactic of Discovery (T1086) is used to gather information about the target environment before performing any other actions. This tactic could be used to discover the best way to hide malicious artifacts, files, processes, and network connections, which leads to the use of Defense Evasion techniques like T1564.001 and T1014. Lateral Movement (T1021) and Resource Development (T1105) are less likely to occur before Defense Evasion, as they involve moving within a network or developing resources for future attacks, respectively. Discovery is the most logical tactic to occur before Defense Evasion in this context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Deep Panda employed the Fire Chili rootkit.
   - The related TTPs mention two Defense Evasion techniques (T1564.001 and T1014), but the question asks for a tactic that occurred before the use of the rootkit.
   - The tactic of Discovery (T1086) is used to gather information about the target environment before performing any other actions, making it the most logical tactic to occur before Defense Evasion.
   - Final Answer: Discovery (T1086)
