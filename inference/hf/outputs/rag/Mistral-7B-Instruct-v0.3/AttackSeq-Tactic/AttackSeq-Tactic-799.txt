 Final Answer: B: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious self-extracting RAR files to achieve initial access but before they established command-and-control with infrastructure hosted on DynDNS services.

2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the Initial Access tactic was used through spear phishing emails (T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). This means the attackers have gained access to the system.

3. The next logical step in an attack sequence would be the Execution tactic (T1059), where the malware or script downloaded through the spear phishing email is executed on the compromised system.

4. Command and Control (T1071) would typically be established after the Execution phase, where the attackers set up a connection to the compromised system to maintain persistence and further control the system.

5. Defense Evasion (T1564) could occur at any stage of the attack, but it is less likely to happen before the attackers have established a foothold in the system (Initial Access and Execution).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566-Phishing) -> Execution (T1059) -> Command and Control (T1071). Since we are asked to find the tactic that most likely occurred after Initial Access but before Command and Control, the answer is B: Execution.
