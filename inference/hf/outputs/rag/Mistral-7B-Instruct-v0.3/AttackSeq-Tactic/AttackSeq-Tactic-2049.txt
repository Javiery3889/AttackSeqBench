 Final Answer: Command and Control (C)

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the iOS malware was already installed on compromised systems. This suggests that the initial infection and execution (Tactic: Execution) has occurred.
2. The malware then started gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data (Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System).
3. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the data gathering stage.
4. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal) and System Information Discovery (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery).
5. Defense Evasion is typically used to hide the malware's presence or activities, making it harder for security solutions to detect it. This could be a necessary step before the malware starts its data gathering activities to avoid detection.
6. System Information Discovery is about gathering information about the system to better understand the environment and prepare for further actions. This could also be a necessary step before the data gathering stage to identify the best data sources and methods.
7. Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that involves establishing a connection between the attacker and the compromised system. This is often necessary for the malware to receive further instructions or to send the gathered data back to the attacker.
8. Therefore, the most plausible answer is Command and Control (C), as it is a logical step between the initial infection and the data gathering stage, and it aligns with the related TTPs of Defense Evasion and System Information Discovery.
