 Final Answer: A: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the activation of a backdoor, which is a technique used to maintain unauthorized access to a system.
2. The backdoor is maintained by keeping a process running in both Linux user and kernel modes, which suggests a persistent presence on the system.
3. The related TTPs mention the tactic of Persistence and the technique T1547, which is about starting executables at boot or logon. This technique is often used to ensure the backdoor remains on the system even after a reboot.
4. The tactic of Execution (B) is about running executables, but it doesn't necessarily imply hiding processes, files, and network connections.
5. The tactic of Lateral Movement (C) is about moving within a network, which doesn't seem to be related to hiding processes, files, and network connections on a single system.
6. The tactic of Privilege Escalation (D) is about gaining higher levels of access, but it doesn't necessarily involve hiding processes, files, and network connections.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Activation of Backdoor (Tactic: Execution) followed by Persistence (Tactic: Persistence) to ensure the backdoor remains on the system. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to hide processes, files, and network connections, and the tactic of Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit) would be more likely to achieve this, but it is not mentioned in the question's answer choices. So, the closest answer from the given choices is A: Persistence.
