 Final Answer: Execution (T1059)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the next tactic after obfuscation techniques were used in a VBA-Macro to download and execute a JavaScript payload.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the tactics of Defense Evasion (T1140) and Execution (T1059) were involved.
3. The technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is related to Defense Evasion, which was used to hinder analysis of the VBA-Macro.
4. The technique T1059.007-JavaScript and T1059.005-Visual Basic are both Execution techniques, but T1059.007 is more relevant as it specifically mentions JavaScript, which was the payload in this case.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Defense Evasion (T1140) to obfuscate the VBA-Macro, followed by Execution (T1059) to download and execute the JavaScript payload.
