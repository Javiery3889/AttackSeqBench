 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The MSIL/Crimson downloader has successfully downloaded the full RAT (Remote Access Trojan). This indicates that the Execution tactic (D) has occurred, as the malware is now present on the system and ready to execute.
2. The question asks for the tactic that most likely follows the execution of the RAT.
3. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic (T1071.001-Web Protocols, T1571-Non-Standard Port, T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol), which are techniques used for communication between the RAT and its servers.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Execution (D) followed by Command and Control (C), as the RAT needs to communicate with its servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Exfiltration (B) and Persistence (A) are not directly related to the communication of the RAT with its servers after it has been executed.
