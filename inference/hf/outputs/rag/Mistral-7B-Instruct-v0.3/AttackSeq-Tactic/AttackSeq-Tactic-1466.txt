 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the BlackEnergy 3 malware was installed after a successful social engineering attack (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) and before the adversaries used the malware for credential harvesting and lateral movement (T1534-Lateral Movement).
2. The Tactic: Lateral Movement and Tactic: Reconnaissance are mentioned, but they are not the initial communication between the malware and an external server.
3. The Tactic: Initial Access is the first step in an attack, and it has been fulfilled with the successful installation of the BlackEnergy 3 malware. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.
4. The Tactic: Collection could be a possibility, but it is more related to data gathering rather than communication.
5. The Tactic: Command and Control is the most likely answer as it involves the communication between the adversary and the compromised system, which is necessary for the malware to receive further instructions and perform actions such as credential harvesting and lateral movement.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) -> Command and Control (for communication between the malware and the external server) -> Lateral Movement (T1534) -> Reconnaissance (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service) -> Collection (for data gathering). However, the question asks for the tactic that facilitated communication, so the final answer is A: Command and Control.
