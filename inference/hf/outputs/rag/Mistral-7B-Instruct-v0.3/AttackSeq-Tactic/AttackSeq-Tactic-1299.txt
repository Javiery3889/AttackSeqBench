 Final Answer: C: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before OceanLotus harvested credentials.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used techniques related to Credential Access (T1003) to harvest credentials. However, it's unlikely that Credential Access would have occurred before itself, as it requires the attacker to already have some form of access to the system.
3. The technique T1003.001-LSASS Memory Dump is a method used to obtain credentials, but it requires initial access to the system.
4. T1003-OS Credential Dumping is another method of Credential Access, but it also requires initial access to the system.
5. The tactic Discovery (T1016) is about gathering information about the network and systems to find potential targets and vulnerabilities. This tactic would be a logical step before attempting to harvest credentials, as it would help the attacker identify systems to target.
6. The tactic Lateral Movement (T1021) is about moving within a network after initial access has been gained. It's not a tactic that would typically occur before Credential Access, as it relies on having credentials to move laterally.
7. Privilege Escalation (T1078) is about gaining higher levels of access within a system. It's not a tactic that would typically occur before Credential Access, as it relies on having initial access to the system.
8. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Discovery (T1016) to find the target system, followed by Credential Access (T1003) to obtain the credentials, and then Lateral Movement (T1021) to move within the network using those credentials. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before Credential Access, so the answer is Discovery (T1016).
