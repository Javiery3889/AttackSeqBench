 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that OceanLotus employed DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion techniques and used encrypted data within hta scripts. This indicates that they have already bypassed the system's defenses and gained access to the compromised computer (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002).

2. The next step in the attack sequence would be to establish communication with the command and control (C2) server, which is what the question refers to as "enabling adversary control of the compromised computer". This is the Tactic: Command and Control (T1071).

3. The answer choices do not include Initial Access (D: Initial Access), as the question assumes that the initial access has already been achieved. Impact (B: Impact) is not directly related to establishing C2 communication. Therefore, the most plausible answer is Command and Control (C: Command and Control).
