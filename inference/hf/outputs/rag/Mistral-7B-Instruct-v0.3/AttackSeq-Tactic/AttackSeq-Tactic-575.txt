 Final Answer: Before the wiper module overwrote the MBR and rendered the system unusable, the most likely tactic that occurred was Impact (T1485-Data Destruction). This is because the Disttrack dropper's wiper module is designed for data destruction, which falls under the Impact tactic. The other tactics (Lateral Movement, Discovery, Command and Control) do not directly involve data destruction or overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a system.
