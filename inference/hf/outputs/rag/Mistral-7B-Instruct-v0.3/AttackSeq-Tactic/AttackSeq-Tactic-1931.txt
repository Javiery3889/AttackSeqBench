 Final Answer: B: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Machete utilized standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers, which is a common method for Command and Control (T1071). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely followed, not the tactic that was initially used.

2. The question also mentions the implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration. This is a technique associated with the Exfiltration tactic (T1041).

3. The related TTPs provided also support the Exfiltration tactic, as they mention Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) and Fallback Channels (T1008), which are techniques often used in the Exfiltration tactic.

4. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely followed the initial communication, and the related TTPs and the question itself point towards Exfiltration, the most plausible answer is B: Exfiltration.
