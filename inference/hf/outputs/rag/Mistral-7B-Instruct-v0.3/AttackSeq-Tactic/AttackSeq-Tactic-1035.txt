 Final Answer: Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before establishing command and control connections to Chinese botnets.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189) and that command and control was established using web protocols (T1071.001). Persistence was also established, but it is not the tactic we are looking for as it is the current state, not the previous one. Credential Access and Impact are not directly related to the given TTPs.

3. Compare and Evaluate: Given the related TTPs, the Initial Access tactic (T1189) is the most likely tactic to have occurred before establishing command and control connections (T1071.001). This is because initial access is the first step in an attack chain, and it is followed by maintaining persistence and then command and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before establishing command and control connections to Chinese botnets.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189) and that command and control was established using web protocols (T1071.001).
   - Given that initial access is the first step in an attack chain, it is the most likely tactic to have occurred before establishing command and control connections.
   - Final Answer: Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
