 Final Answer: B: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the threat actor used spear-phishing emails to compromise victims in CIS countries.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through phishing (T1566) and spear-phishing link (T1566.002).
3. Once the Initial Access is gained, the next logical step in an attack sequence would be to obtain credentials for further access and movement within the compromised system. This is the Credential Access tactic (T1078, T1087, etc.).
4. Execution (A) and Resource Development (C) are not directly related to the compromise of victims through spear-phishing emails. Initial Access (D) is the tactic used to gain access to the system, which has already been achieved according to the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Credential Access.
