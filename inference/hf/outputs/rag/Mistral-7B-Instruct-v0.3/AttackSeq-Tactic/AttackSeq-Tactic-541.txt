 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server and used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used a command and control (C2) tactic and specifically employed web protocols (T1071.001) and symmetric cryptography (T1573.001).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Command and Control (A) is the tactic that involves establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system. Using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests (T1573.001) is a technique under the Command and Control tactic.
   - Exfiltration (B) is the tactic of transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker. While it could follow Command and Control, it doesn't necessarily have to occur immediately after the initial communication is established.
   - Discovery (C) is the tactic of gathering information about the compromised system. This tactic is more about gathering information rather than establishing communication or transferring data.
   - Collection (D) is the tactic of gathering data from the compromised system. Similar to Discovery, this tactic is more about gathering information rather than establishing communication or transferring data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server, which is a Command and Control (C2) tactic (T1071.001).
   - To secure this communication, the agent used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests (T1573.001).
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after these events, it is logical to assume that the attacker would continue to use the Command and Control tactic to issue further commands or receive data from the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Command and Control.
