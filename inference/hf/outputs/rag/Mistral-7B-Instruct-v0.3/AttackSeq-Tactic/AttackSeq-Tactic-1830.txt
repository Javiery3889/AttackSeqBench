 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic (T1203) as the technique used for client execution, which aligns with the exploitation of the vulnerability in the question. This suggests that the malware was executed on the compromised system.
3. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial access, not the execution of the malware.
4. The Initial Access tactic (T1566) was used to gain entry into the target systems, but it is not the tactic that would follow after the initial access has been achieved.
5. The Persistence tactic (T1078) is about maintaining access to the system, which would come after the initial execution of the malware, but before any lateral movement.
6. The Execution tactic (T1203) is about executing code on the compromised system, which has already been covered in the related TTPs.
7. The remaining tactic is Lateral Movement (T1021), which involves moving within a network to spread the attack or gain access to other systems. This tactic would likely follow the execution of the malware on the initial compromised system, as the malware could then be used to move laterally within the network.
8. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Lateral Movement.
