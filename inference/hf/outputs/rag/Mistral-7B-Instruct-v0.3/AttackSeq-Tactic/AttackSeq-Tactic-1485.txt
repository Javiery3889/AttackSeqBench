 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the malware communicating with its C2 server after gathering network information for lateral movement.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic, which involves the establishment of a connection between the attacker and the compromised system.
3. The technique T1071.001 refers to the use of Web Protocols for Command and Control communication.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Gathering Network Information (Lateral Movement) -> Communication with C2 Server (Command and Control).
5. Since the communication with the C2 server is happening using the HTTP protocol, as indicated in the related TTP T1071.001, the answer is C: Command and Control.
