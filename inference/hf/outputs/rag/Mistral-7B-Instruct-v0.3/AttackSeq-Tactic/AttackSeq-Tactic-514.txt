 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the reconnaissance activities have identified English-speaking targets, but the shellcode within Word macros executing the Rising Sun implant payload has not occurred yet.
2. The related TTPs list the Execution tactic, which includes the technique T1204.002 (Use of Malicious File) and T1059.005 (PowerShell Empire). These techniques are related to the execution of malicious files or scripts.
3. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after reconnaissance but before the execution of the Rising Sun implant payload.
4. The Initial Access tactic (T1078) is the most likely answer as it involves gaining access to a system, which would be a necessary step before executing any malicious files or implants.
5. The other tactics (Execution, Exfiltration, Command and Control) are more related to actions that occur after the initial access and the execution of the malware.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Reconnaissance -> Initial Access (T1078) -> Execution (T1204.002 or T1059.005).
