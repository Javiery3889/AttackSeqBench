 Final Answer: Collection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor probed files in specified directories during the Discovery phase. This indicates that they are gathering information about the target environment.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic and the specific technique T1071.001-Web Protocols, which suggests that communication with the C&C server over HTTPS is part of the Command and Control activities. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the Discovery phase but before the Command and Control activities.
3. The Collection tactic involves the gathering of data from a target or the environment. This could include probing files and directories, as mentioned in the question, but it also includes other methods of data collection.
4. The Execution tactic involves the running of code on the target system, which is not mentioned as happening between the Discovery phase and the Command and Control activities.
5. Resource Development is a tactic that involves creating or acquiring resources for future operations, such as building infrastructure or acquiring credentials. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) -> Collection (gathering more data, possibly including the execution of scripts or tools to collect specific data) -> Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
