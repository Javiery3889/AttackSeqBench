 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the Sednit group gained initial access via a spearphishing email campaign. This aligns with the Tactic: Initial Access and Techniques T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
2. The question then asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before they established persistence using COM object hijacking.
3. Since the initial access has been established, the next logical step would be to execute the malware or payload delivered through the spearphishing email. This is the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution).
4. After executing the malware, the attacker would then perform Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation) or Persistence (Tactic: Persistence) to maintain their presence in the system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before Persistence, so we can rule out Privilege Escalation and Persistence at this stage.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566) -> Execution (T1105). After executing the malware, the attacker would then perform Privilege Escalation or Persistence to maintain their presence in the system.
