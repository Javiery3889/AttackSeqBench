 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of credential-stealing modules, which is a part of the Credential Access tactic (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing).
2. The related TTPs mention the Discovery tactic (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery).
3. The Discovery tactic is used to gather information about the target environment, such as identifying running processes and memory utilization.
4. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.
5. Given the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and the related TTPs, it is most plausible that the Discovery tactic occurred after the Credential Access tactic, as the attacker would need the stolen credentials to access the system and then discover processes and memory utilization.
6. Therefore, the final answer is B: Discovery.
