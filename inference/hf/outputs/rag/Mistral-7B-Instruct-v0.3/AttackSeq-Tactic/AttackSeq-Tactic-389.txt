 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when the scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers.
2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic (T1059.005) which refers to the use of VBA macros within malicious Word documents. This indicates that the initial execution of the attack has occurred.
3. However, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the execution of the VBA macros.
4. The Command and Control (C2) tactic (T1071) is the most likely answer as it involves the establishment of a connection between the compromised system and an external server for further communication and control.
5. The Impact tactic (T1068) is typically used after the attacker has gained control of the system and is looking to cause damage or exfiltrate data. The Impact tactic does not directly involve communication with external servers.
6. The Initial Access tactic (T1078) is the first step in an attack chain, where the attacker gains access to a system. In this case, the initial access has already been achieved through the execution of VBA macros.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Initial Access (T1078) - Execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents
- Command and Control (T1071) - Communication with external servers after the execution of VBA macros.
