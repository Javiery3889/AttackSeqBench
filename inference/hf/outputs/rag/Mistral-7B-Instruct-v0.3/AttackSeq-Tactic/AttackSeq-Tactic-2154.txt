 Final Answer: Privilege Escalation

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that APT41 moved laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems. This indicates that they have already gained Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access) to the network and have moved laterally (Tactic: Lateral Movement).
2. The question does not mention any data collection activities (Tactic: Collection) at this point.
3. The question does not suggest that APT41 is attempting to gain Initial Access again (Tactic: Initial Access) after moving laterally.
4. The question mentions manipulating virtual currencies or attempting to deploy ransomware, which are activities that typically require higher privileges (Tactic: Privilege Escalation).
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access) -> Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement) -> Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation) -> Impact (Tactic: Impact). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after lateral movement and before impact, the answer is Privilege Escalation.
