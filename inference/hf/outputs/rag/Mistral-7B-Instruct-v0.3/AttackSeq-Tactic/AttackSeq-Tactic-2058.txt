 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that includes operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval from its C&C server.
2. Analyzing the related TTPs, we see that the Tactic: Command and Control is mentioned, and one of its techniques, T1071.001-Web Protocols, uses web protocols for command and control.
3. Among the answer choices, only Command and Control (C) includes the use of HTTP for communication and command retrieval, which aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique.
4. Lateral Movement (A) does not involve HTTP communication or command retrieval from a C&C server.
5. Discovery (B) is about gathering information about the target environment, but it does not necessarily involve HTTP communication or command retrieval.
6. Impact (D) is about causing damage or disrupting the target system, which does not seem to be the case in this scenario as Grandoreiro is collecting information, not causing damage.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Discovery (B): Grandoreiro collects victim information.
2. Command and Control (C): Grandoreiro communicates and retrieves commands over HTTP from its C&C server.
