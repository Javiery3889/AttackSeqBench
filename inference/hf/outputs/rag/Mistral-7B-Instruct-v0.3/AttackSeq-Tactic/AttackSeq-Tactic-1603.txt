 Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents (T1566-Phishing and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
3. After gaining initial access, the attackers would typically perform Reconnaissance to gather information about the victim's system before moving on to other tactics such as Execution, Command and Control, or lateral movement.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566-Phishing) -> Reconnaissance -> Gathering information using an undocumented Word feature.
5. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the gathering of information, the answer is A: Reconnaissance.
