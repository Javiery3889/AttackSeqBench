 Final Answer: C: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the Sednit group scanned for specific file extensions, which is a collection technique (T1119-Automated Collection).
2. The related TTPs mention two collection techniques (T1005-Data from Local System and T1119-Automated Collection) and one credential access technique (T1003-OS Credential Dumping).
3. The question states that the Sednit group used dumpers on victim machines to retrieve credential-related databases, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic (T1003-OS Credential Dumping).
4. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the collection techniques, it is reasonable to assume that the credential access was performed before the collection of data from the local system and automated collection.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) -> Collection (T1005-Data from Local System) -> Collection (T1119-Automated Collection).
