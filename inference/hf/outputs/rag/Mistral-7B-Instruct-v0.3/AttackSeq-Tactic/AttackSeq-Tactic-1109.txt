 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attacker compromised the Afghan Government's CDN server through a strategic web compromise. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic (T1189-Drive-by Compromise). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely followed the modification of the Javascript file, not the initial access.

2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic (T1059.007-JavaScript), which involves the use of scripts for execution. This is directly related to the modification of the Javascript file jquery-1.4.2.min.js to serve malicious code.

3. The Command and Control tactic (T1090.004-Domain Fronting) is not directly related to the modification of the Javascript file, but rather a method used for communication between the attacker and compromised system.

4. Lateral Movement (T1021) and Defense Evasion (T1027) tactics are not mentioned in the question or related TTPs, so they are less likely to be the answer.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) -> Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript).
