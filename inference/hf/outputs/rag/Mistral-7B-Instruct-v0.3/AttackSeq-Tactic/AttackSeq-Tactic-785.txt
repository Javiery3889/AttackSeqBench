 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the Lazarus Group delivered malicious documents containing job offers that activated macros on victims' home computers. This action is typically associated with the Initial Access tactic (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1192-Phishing: Email Attachment), but it does not specify the execution of the malware at this point.
2. The question then mentions the execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher. This action is associated with the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204-Command and Scripting Interpreter).
3. The tactic of Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access) involves stealing, dumping, or reusing credentials, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
4. Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement) is a tactic that involves moving within a network to spread the attack, but it is not mentioned in the sequence of TTPs in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1192) -> Execution (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002) -> [Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement) if applicable, but not specified in the question].
