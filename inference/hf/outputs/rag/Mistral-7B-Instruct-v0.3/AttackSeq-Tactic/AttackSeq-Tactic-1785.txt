 Final Answer: A: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the initial payload was dropped and executed after a Word document exploit (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
2. The next step in the attack sequence is to achieve the Execution tactic (T1059), which involves running the malicious code.
3. The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of events described in the question. Discovery (B) is about gathering information about the target environment, Resource Development (C) is about creating tools, resources, and infrastructure, and Initial Access (D) is about gaining access to a system, which has already been achieved through the exploit.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (Delivery of malicious Word document) -> Execution (Execution of the malicious code).
