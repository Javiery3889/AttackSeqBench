 Final Answer: C: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the exploitation of Microsoft Word vulnerabilities in RTF documents to drop 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder for persistence. This action aligns with the Persistence tactic (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
2. The question does not provide any information about the malware evading detection or developing resources at this stage.
3. The question also mentions the malware downloading and decrypting the next stage of the infection chain from the server at 95.179.242[.]6, which is an action that typically occurs after persistence has been established.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Tactic: Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) -> Tactic: Command and Control (T1071) (downloading and decrypting the next stage of the infection chain). The question does not provide enough information to definitively say what tactic would occur after Command and Control, but it is not Defense Evasion (T1221-Template Injection) or Resource Development (T1137.006-Add-ins) as those tactics do not seem to be directly related to the actions described in the question.
