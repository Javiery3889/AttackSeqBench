 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file. This indicates that the Initial Access tactic (T1078) has already been achieved, as the attackers have gained access to the server.

2. The question does not provide any information about the attackers evading detection or developing resources at this stage.

3. After gaining initial access, a common next step in an attack sequence is to establish Command and Control (T1053) to maintain persistence and further execute commands on the compromised system. This is the most plausible sequence of TTPs given the information provided in the question.

4. The Defense Evasion tactic (T1027) and Resource Development tactic (T1078) are not the most likely choices as they do not follow the sequence of events described in the question. The Initial Access tactic (T1078) has already been achieved, and there is no indication of the need for resource development or defense evasion at this stage.
