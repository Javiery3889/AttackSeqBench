 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the delivery of malicious RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8570.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the tactics involved are Execution, specifically Technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and T1204.002-Malicious File.
3. The delivery of malicious RTF documents (T1192-Spearphishing Attachment) is a method to achieve Initial Access (T1078) or Execution, depending on the success of the exploit. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the successful exploitation, the most plausible answer is Execution.
4. The answer choices provided are A: Collection, B: Impact, C: Execution, and D: Initial Access. Given the reasoning above, the most appropriate answer is C: Execution.
