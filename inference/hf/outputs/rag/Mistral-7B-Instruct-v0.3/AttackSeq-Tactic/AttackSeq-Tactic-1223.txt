 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already used the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes (T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials) and prepared collected intellectual property for exfiltration.
2. After dumping the credentials, the attackers need a way to maintain communication with the compromised systems to receive commands and retrieve binary code.
3. The Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System, does not directly relate to maintaining communication with a server.
4. The Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping, is related to the initial credential access but does not describe the ongoing communication between the compromised systems and the attacker's server.
5. The Tactic: Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that describes the ongoing communication between the compromised systems and a remote server.
6. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: Command and Control.
