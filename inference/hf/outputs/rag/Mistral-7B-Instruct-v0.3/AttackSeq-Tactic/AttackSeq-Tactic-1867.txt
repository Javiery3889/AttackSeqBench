 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor established communication with its C2 server.
2. The related TTPs provided include Command and Control (T1071.001), Discovery (T1049), and Exfiltration (T1041).
3. The Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.001) is related to the establishment of communication between the backdoor and the C2 server, which aligns with the question.
4. The Tactic: Discovery (T1049) is about gathering information about the network, which is not directly related to the action that would follow the communication establishment.
5. The Tactic: Exfiltration (T1041) is about stealing data and sending it out of the compromised system. However, it is not necessarily the next step after establishing communication, as the attacker might first issue commands to the compromised system (Command and Control).
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Establishing Communication (T1071.001) -> Command and Control (Tactic). This is followed by potential further actions such as Discovery, Lateral Movement, or Exfiltration, depending on the attacker's objectives. However, the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after the communication establishment, so the answer is Command and Control (Tactic A).
