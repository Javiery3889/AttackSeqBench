 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that a PowerShell script executed a .NET DLL file containing the malicious payload, which falls under the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell).
2. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the PowerShell execution but before the malware employed the InstallUtil.exe technique.
3. The related TTPs mention the Defense Evasion tactic (Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.004-InstallUtil.exe), but it is not the tactic that occurred after the PowerShell execution in the given sequence.
4. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the PowerShell execution is the Execution tactic, as it is the next logical step in the sequence after the malicious payload was executed. The Defense Evasion tactic (T1218.004-InstallUtil.exe) would be employed later to bypass detection mechanisms, as stated in the question.
