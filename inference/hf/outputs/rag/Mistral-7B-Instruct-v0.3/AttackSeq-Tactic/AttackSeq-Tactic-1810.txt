 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers have collected credentials and prepared them for transmission every hour. This aligns with the Tactic: Collection (T1589.001-Credentials) from the related TTPs.
2. The attackers then established a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server. This action is a part of the Tactic: Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration), but it requires a Command and Control (C2) channel to be established first.
3. The Tactic: Resource Development is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
4. The Tactic: Reconnaissance is also not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it is more about gathering information about the target before an attack, not during or after the attack.
5. The Tactic: Command and Control (T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols) is the most plausible answer as it involves the use of File Transfer Protocols (FTP) to exfiltrate data, which is what the attackers did in this case. Establishing a C2 channel is a prerequisite for data exfiltration, making this the most logical choice.
