 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the malware communicated with its C&C servers.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) and Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration) tactics. However, the question specifies that the malware communicated with its C&C servers, which suggests the Command and Control tactic is more relevant in this context.
3. The Exfiltration tactic (T1048.002) is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server, but rather the transfer of data from the compromised system to an unauthorized location.
4. The Lateral Movement tactic (T1021) is about moving within a network, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
5. The Discovery tactic (T1086) is about gathering information about the target environment, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server either.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1071.001 (Command and Control) followed by another Command and Control-related TTP, such as T1071.002 (Ingress Tool Transfer) or T1071.003 (External Remote Services), depending on the specific actions taken after the initial communication. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the communication, so the answer is D: Command and Control.
