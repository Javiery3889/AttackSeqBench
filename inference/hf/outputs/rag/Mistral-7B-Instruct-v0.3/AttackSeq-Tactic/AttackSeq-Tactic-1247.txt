 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the establishment of command and control communication.
2. The related TTPs provided indicate that the attacker used Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to gain access to the system, and then Defense Evasion (T1218.005-Mshta) to execute the embedded HTA script within the '.lnk' files.
3. Command and Control (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer) is the tactic that occurs after Initial Access, as it involves establishing communication with the C2 domains.
4. Exfiltration (T1041) and Execution (T1059) are not relevant to the sequence of events described in the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) -> Defense Evasion (T1218.005-Mshta) -> Command and Control (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer).
