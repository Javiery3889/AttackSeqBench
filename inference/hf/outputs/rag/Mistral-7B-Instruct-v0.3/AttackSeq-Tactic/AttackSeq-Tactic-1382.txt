 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after TeamTNT downloaded and executed a coin miner payload but before they tracked infected hosts using iplogger.org.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used Command and Control tactics, specifically T1102-Web Service and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer. These techniques are often used for maintaining persistence, receiving commands, and transferring additional tools.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Execution - This tactic refers to the initial execution of a payload, which has already occurred according to the question.
   - B: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which is not directly related to tracking infected hosts or transferring tools.
   - D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data, which is not mentioned as a step between the execution of the coin miner and tracking infected hosts.
   - C: Command and Control - This tactic is related to maintaining persistence, receiving commands, and transferring additional tools, which could include the transfer of a tool for tracking infected hosts (as mentioned in the question).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question states that TeamTNT downloaded and executed a coin miner payload. This indicates that the Execution tactic has occurred.
   - The question then asks for the next tactic that most likely occurred before they tracked infected hosts using iplogger.org.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used Command and Control tactics, which could include the transfer of a tool for tracking infected hosts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Execution (A) followed by Command and Control (C) before Discovery (B) or Exfiltration (D).
