 Final Answer: B: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Iron Tiger gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the Initial Access tactic was used to compromise the servers, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this initial access.
3. The Initial Access tactic is about gaining access to a system, not about what happens after that access has been gained.
4. The Defense Evasion tactic is about making an attacker's presence or activities on a compromised system less visible to the victim, which doesn't necessarily follow after initial access and exfiltration.
5. The Resource Development tactic is about building and maintaining capabilities, tools, infrastructure, and resources for future attacks, which also doesn't seem to be a logical next step after initial access and exfiltration.
6. The Exfiltration tactic is about stealing data from a compromised system, which could be a logical next step after gaining initial access to the system and compromising its servers.
7. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Exfiltration.
