 Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. After compromising domain administrator passwords and gaining access to all active domain accounts, the attackers have gained a high level of access within the network.
2. The Tactic: Initial Access and Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts are related to the initial compromise of the network, so they are not the next step in the attack sequence.
3. Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts) is not the most likely next step because the attackers already have high-level privileges.
4. Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration) is a common final step in an attack, but it typically occurs after the attackers have moved laterally within the network to gather data and establish a foothold.
5. Execution (Tactic: Execution) is a broad tactic that includes various techniques for running malicious code, but it is not directly related to moving within the network after gaining high-level access.
6. Lateral Movement (Tactic: Lateral Movement) is the most likely next step after gaining high-level access, as it allows the attackers to move within the network to gather more information, establish a foothold, and potentially prepare for exfiltration or other malicious activities.
7. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Compromise Domain Administrator Passwords (Initial Access) -> Gain Access to All Active Domain Accounts (Initial Access) -> Lateral Movement (Lateral Movement) -> Employ Metasploit for System Reconnaissance and Progressing Through Other Networks (Execution).
