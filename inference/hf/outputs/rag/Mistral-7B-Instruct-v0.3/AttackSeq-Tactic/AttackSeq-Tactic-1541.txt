 Final Answer: B: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attackers collected and prepared valuable documents, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection techniques T1213.001-Confluence and T1005-Data from Local System.
2. The attackers have already gained access to the system, as they were able to collect documents, which suggests that the Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access) has already occurred.
3. The attackers have also performed reconnaissance, as they have gathered information about internal applications and procedures, which aligns with the Tactic: Reconnaissance technique T1589.001-Credentials. However, this is not the final step in the attack sequence.
4. The Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) tactic is typically used to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems, not for exfiltrating data.
5. The final step in this attack sequence is the exfiltration of the collected data, which aligns with the Tactic: Exfiltration. This is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided in the question and the related TTPs.
