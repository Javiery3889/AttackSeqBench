 Final Answer: Exfiltration

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the components have not yet uploaded collected data and credentials to the FTP server. This implies that the data has been collected but not yet exfiltrated.
2. The related TTPs mention the Exfiltration tactic and the Automated Exfiltration technique, which involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an unauthorized location.
3. The Collection tactic (T1005) is related to the initial data gathering, which in this case, has already occurred as the personal files, keylogging, and clipboard content have been collected.
4. Lateral Movement (T1021) and Command and Control (T1053) tactics are typically used for moving within a network or establishing communication channels, which have not been mentioned as occurring after the data collection but before the exfiltration in the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Collection (T1005) -> Exfiltration (T1020).
