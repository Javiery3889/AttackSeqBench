 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the sequence of events after the PRB-Backdoor began communicating with hxxp://outl00k[.]net.
2. The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) and Web Protocols (T1071.001) technique, which suggests that the PRB-Backdoor is communicating with a Command and Control server.
3. The Execution (Tactic: Execution) and Malicious File (T1204.002) technique are related to the initial delivery of the backdoor payload, which occurred before the communication with the Command and Control server.
4. The Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) and Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140) technique are related to the obfuscation methods used for the macro scripts, which also occurred before the communication with the Command and Control server.
5. Privilege Escalation (Tactic: Privilege Escalation) is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Defense Evasion (obfuscation of macro scripts), Execution (delivery of backdoor payload), and Command and Control (communication with Command and Control server). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the PRB-Backdoor began communicating with the Command and Control server, so the final answer is Command and Control (B).
