 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the attackers have performed discovery tasks, specifically downloading GitHub snippets for command parsing and retrieving the username and computer name. These actions are typically associated with the Discovery tactic (Tactic: Discovery, Techniques: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, T1033-System Owner/User Discovery).
2. After discovering the network and system details, the next logical step for an attacker would be to move laterally within the network to gain access to other systems or escalate privileges. This is the Lateral Movement tactic (Tactic: Lateral Movement).
3. Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) is a tactic used to avoid detection by security solutions, which doesn't seem to follow the sequence of events mentioned in the question.
4. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) is a tactic used to maintain communication between the attacker and compromised systems, but it doesn't necessarily follow the sequence of events mentioned in the question, as the attacker has not yet established a command and control channel.
5. Collection (Tactic: Collection) is a tactic used to gather data from the compromised system, but it doesn't seem to follow the sequence of events mentioned in the question, as the attacker has not yet started collecting data after the discovery phase.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the SLUB backdoor was used for discovery tasks would be Discovery -> Lateral Movement.
