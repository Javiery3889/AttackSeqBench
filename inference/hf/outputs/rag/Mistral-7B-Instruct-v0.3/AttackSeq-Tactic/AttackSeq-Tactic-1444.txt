 Final Answer: A: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the preparation of compromised web servers to host malicious scripts, which is a part of the Initial Access tactic as it involves gaining unauthorized access to a system.
2. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation, and Persistence tactics. However, these tactics are often subsequent steps in an attack sequence, not the initial access.
3. The Execution tactic is about executing commands or scripts on a compromised system, but it doesn't involve the preparation of compromised servers or DLL hijacking, which are mentioned in the question.
4. The Discovery tactic is about gathering information about the target environment, which doesn't seem to be related to the actions mentioned in the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Initial Access, as it aligns best with the sequence of events described in the question.
