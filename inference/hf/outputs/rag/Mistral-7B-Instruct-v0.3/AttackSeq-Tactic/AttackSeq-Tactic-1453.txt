 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: SkinnyBoy collects base64 encoded data from systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories using the CryptBinaryToStringA API. The question asks for the most likely tactic that occurred to transfer this data to the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding, Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System, and Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Command and Control (A) is about maintaining persistence, initial access, or communication with the compromised system. While it's true that C2 communication is often used for exfiltration, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred to transfer the data, not the tactic used for communication.
   - Privilege Escalation (B) is about gaining higher levels of access on a compromised system. There's no indication in the question that SkinnyBoy is trying to escalate privileges.
   - Impact (D) is about causing damage or disrupting the normal functioning of a system. There's no indication in the question that SkinnyBoy is causing any impact.
   - Exfiltration (C) is about stealing data from a compromised system. The question mentions that SkinnyBoy collects data and wants to transfer it to the C2 server, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred to transfer the data collected by SkinnyBoy to the C2 server.
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - Since the question mentions that SkinnyBoy collects data and wants to transfer it to the C2 server, and the related TTPs suggest that exfiltration over C2 is a likely technique, the most plausible answer is C: Exfiltration.
