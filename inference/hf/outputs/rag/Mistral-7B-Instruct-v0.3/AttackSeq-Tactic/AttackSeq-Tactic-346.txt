 Final Answer: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Trickbot connected to a Command and Control (C2) server to download and execute the payload. This action is associated with the Command and Control (C) tactic (Answer Choice C). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this event.

2. The question then states that Trickbot deleted files with specific extensions on removable and network drives and replaced them with a copy of the malware. This action is not directly related to Initial Access (A), Impact (B), or Command and Control (C).

3. The related TTPs mention the Tactic of Defense Evasion and the Technique of T1070.004-File Deletion, which aligns with the action of Trickbot deleting and replacing files.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Command and Control (C2 connection and payload execution)
   - Defense Evasion (file deletion and replacement)

5. So, the final answer is Defense Evasion (D).
