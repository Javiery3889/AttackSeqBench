 Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of a GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts, which aligns with Technique T1059.001 - PowerShell.
2. The related TTPs include Defense Evasion tactics, which suggests that the attacker is trying to avoid detection by security measures.
3. The obfuscation of the PowerShell scripts (T1027.010 - Command Obfuscation) is a technique used for Defense Evasion.
4. After deploying the backdoor, the attacker would likely want to ensure it remains undetected, making Defense Evasion the most plausible tactic to occur next in the attack sequence.
5. The other answer choices do not align as well with the given information. Impact (B) would typically occur later in the attack sequence, after the attacker has gained access to sensitive data or systems. Collection (C) could potentially follow Defense Evasion, but it is not the most likely tactic to occur immediately after the deployment of a backdoor. Command and Control (D) is a tactic that would likely be used to communicate with the compromised system, but it is not necessarily a tactic that would occur after Defense Evasion.
