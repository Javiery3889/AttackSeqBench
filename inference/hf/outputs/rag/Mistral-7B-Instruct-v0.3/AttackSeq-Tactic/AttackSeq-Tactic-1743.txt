 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Command and Control (C&C) was performed using steganography, and the related TTPs mention the use of steganography in the Command and Control tactic (T1001.002). However, this TTP is used to hide C&C data, not to establish the C&C channel itself.
2. The question also mentions the use of steganography in the Defense Evasion tactic (T1027.003), but this TTP is used to hide malicious activity from detection, not to transfer data.
3. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable the attackers to transfer the stolen data. Since steganography was used to hide data, the most logical next step would be to exfiltrate (transfer) the stolen data.
4. The Exfiltration tactic (T1041) is the tactic that involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker's system or an intermediate system. The related TTPs do not mention any other tactic that would be more likely to follow the use of steganography for data hiding and transfer.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Command and Control (T1001) using steganography (T1001.002) to establish a covert C&C channel, followed by Exfiltration (T1041) to transfer the stolen data using the established C&C channel.
