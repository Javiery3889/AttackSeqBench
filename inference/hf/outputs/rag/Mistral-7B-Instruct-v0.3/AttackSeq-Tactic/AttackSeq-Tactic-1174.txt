 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after APT28 scanned IPs and identified vulnerable systems, but before spear phishing emails were used.
2. The related TTPs mention Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses) and Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
3. Reconnaissance is about gathering information about the target, which is what APT28 did by scanning IPs and identifying vulnerable systems.
4. Initial Access is about gaining unauthorized access to a system, which is a logical step after identifying vulnerable systems and before sending spear phishing emails to exploit those systems.
5. Impact and Credential Access are not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Reconnaissance (T1589.002-Email Addresses) -> Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). Since Initial Access is the tactic that most likely occurred after Reconnaissance and before spear phishing emails, the final answer is Initial Access.
