 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attacker gained initial access through high-profile ad networks, which aligns with the Technique T1583.001-Domains (Use of Domain Fronting) and T1583.008-Malvertising (Use of Malvertising for Initial Access).
2. The question then mentions the use of 'domain shadowing' with stolen registration credentials to configure malicious subdomains for filtering and redirection. This action is part of the Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domain Shadowing (Use of Stolen Registration Credentials to Register Domains).
3. The Tactic: Resource Development is about establishing a presence in the target environment, which is a prerequisite for further actions like Defense Evasion, Collection, or Execution. However, the specific technique of domain shadowing is most closely related to the Initial Access tactic, as it involves gaining control over a domain to facilitate further activities.
4. Collection and Execution tactics do not directly involve the creation of malicious subdomains, while Defense Evasion is about hiding the presence of the attacker, which is a later stage in the attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (T1583.001-Domains and T1583.008-Malvertising) followed by Resource Development (T1584.001-Domain Shadowing).
