 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Earth Lusca acquired credentials using Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit, which falls under the Tactic: Credential Access (T1589.001-Credentials). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred when the group scanned the compromised network environment.

2. The related TTPs provided mention Tactic: Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool) and Tactic: Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials). While T1588.002-Tool is related to the use of tools for resource development, it does not directly answer the question about the tactic that occurred when scanning the network.

3. Tactic: Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials) is related to the initial credential acquisition, but it also includes the use of tools to gather information about the target network. The related TTP T1589.001-Credentials mentions the use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan, which are mentioned in the question.

4. Tactic: Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) is not directly related to the tactic that occurred when scanning the network. Resource Development (T1588.002-Tool) and Credential Access (T1589.001-Credentials) are more related to the initial compromise, while Discovery (T1087) involves the use of tools to gather information about the target network, which aligns best with the question. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Credential Access (T1589.001-Credentials) -> Discovery (T1087).
