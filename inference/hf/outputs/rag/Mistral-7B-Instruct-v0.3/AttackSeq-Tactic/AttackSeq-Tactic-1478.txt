 Final Answer: Command and Control (D)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the Duke group securely communicated with their command-and-control server.
2. The related TTPs provided are related to the Command and Control tactic, specifically the use of standard encoding (T1132.001) and encrypted channels (T1573).
3. The use of secure communication methods like layered encryption and encoding is typically used for Command and Control, as it allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised systems.
4. After establishing a secure communication channel, the next logical step would be to issue commands to the compromised systems, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.
5. The other tactics (Collection, Exfiltration, Lateral Movement) are not directly related to the secure communication established in the question.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding (used for secure communication)
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel (used for secure communication)
   - Tactic: Command and Control (issuing commands to compromised systems)
