 Final Answer: B: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the threat actor gained entry via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that downloaded base64-encoded CAB files through embedded scripts. This sequence of TTPs falls under the Initial Access tactic (T1192).

2. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access. The related TTPs provided (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link and T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) are both Initial Access techniques, which means the threat actor has already gained access to the system.

3. The remaining tactics are Execution (T1053), Impact (T1087), and Exfiltration (T1041). Among these, Execution (T1053) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that would follow the Initial Access. This is because once the threat actor has gained access, they would typically execute the malware or scripts they've downloaded, which is the Execution phase.

4. Impact (T1087) and Exfiltration (T1041) are tactics that would typically occur later in the attack chain, after the threat actor has established a foothold and executed their malware or scripts. Therefore, Execution (T1053) is the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial access.
