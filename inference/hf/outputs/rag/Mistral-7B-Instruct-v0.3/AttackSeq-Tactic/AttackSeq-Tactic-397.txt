 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that MuddyWater utilized tools and techniques for obscuring their activities, specifically PS2EXE compilation and Invoke-Obfuscation. These techniques are often used for Defense Evasion (T1027) and Execution (T1059), but they do not directly involve communication with compromised systems.
2. The question then states that communication with compromised systems through domains such as arbiogaz.com and bangortalk.org.uk occurred. This is a clear indication of Command and Control (T1071) activity.
3. The related TTPs mention Credential Access (T1003) and DNS (T1071), both of which are relevant to Command and Control. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred next, and the sequence of events suggests that Command and Control would be the most likely tactic to follow the initial obfuscation techniques.
4. Resource Development (T1108) is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question. Credential Access (T1003) could potentially be a part of the attack sequence, but it is not the tactic that occurred next in this case.
