 Final Answer: A: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability.
2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic (T1203) for Client Execution, which aligns with the initial access through exploitation.
3. The Discovery tactic (T1082) is related to system information gathering, but it is not the next logical step after initial access.
4. Resource Development (C) and Defense Evasion (D) are not directly related to the initial access phase.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (A) -> Execution (T1203) -> Discovery (T1082) -> Defense Evasion (D) -> Resource Development (C). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after initial access but before system information gathering, the answer is A: Initial Access.
