 Final Answer: A: Persistence

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks by deploying web shells and custom malware.
2. The related TTPs mention the tactic of Persistence, specifically the technique T1505.003-Web Shell, which is a method used to maintain access to a compromised system.
3. The tactic of Initial Access (T1133-External Remote Services) was used to initially gain access to the victim network, but it does not necessarily follow the tactic of Persistence, as the attacker would need to establish a means to re-access the compromised system after the initial access is lost.
4. The tactic of Execution (T1059) involves the running of malicious code, which is already covered in the initial compromise by FIN13's deployment of web shells and custom malware.
5. The tactic of Discovery (T1086) is about gathering information about the network, which is typically an early stage in an attack and does not follow the sequence of events described in the question.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (T1133) -> Execution (T1059) -> Persistence (T1505.003). Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial compromise, the answer is A: Persistence.
