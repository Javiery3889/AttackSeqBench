 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the initial reconnaissance and before the malicious macro was injected into the memory of Word.
2. From the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker used a malicious file (T1204.002) for execution, which aligns with the Execution tactic.
3. The Initial Access tactic (T1566.001) was used earlier in the attack sequence, as the question mentions the spearphishing attachment, which is a method used for Initial Access.
4. The Impact tactic (A) and Reconnaissance tactic (C) are not the most likely choices because they do not directly follow the actions described in the question.
5. The Execution tactic (D) is the most plausible choice because it involves the use of a malicious file, which is what the attacker will use to execute the Sharpshooter downloader in the memory of Word.
