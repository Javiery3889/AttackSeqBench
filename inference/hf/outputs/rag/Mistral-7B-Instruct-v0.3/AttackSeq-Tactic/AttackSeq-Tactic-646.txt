 Final Answer: C: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email (Initial Access) and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.

2. Analyzing the Related TTPs, we see that the Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, and Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading are all related to DLL side-loading.

3. The DLL side-loading technique can be used for various purposes such as Privilege Escalation, Persistence, and Defense Evasion. However, it is most likely used after the Initial Access (delivering Gh0st RAT via email) and before Lateral Movement, as it is a technique used to execute malicious code with higher privileges or to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

4. Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL is the Execution tactic, as it encompasses the execution of the malicious code (Gh0st RAT) with the help of DLL side-loading, which could also lead to Persistence or Privilege Escalation in the future.
