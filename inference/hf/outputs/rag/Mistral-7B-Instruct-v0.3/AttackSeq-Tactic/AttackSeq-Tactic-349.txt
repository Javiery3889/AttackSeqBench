 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of a modular backdoor (lightSpy) to gain control over the iOS device, which aligns with the Tactic: Execution.
2. The related TTPs mention the Initial Access tactic, which typically refers to the first step in an attack, but in this case, the initial access has already been achieved through the execution of the backdoor.
3. The related TTPs also mention the Defense Evasion tactic, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the execution of the backdoor. Defense Evasion tactics are usually employed to hide the presence of the malware after it has been executed, not during the execution process.
4. The related TTPs mention the Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories, which is a Defense Evasion technique, but it is not the tactic that occurred immediately after the execution of the backdoor.
5. The question also mentions the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection, which is a part of the Execution tactic (Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript). Exploiting a vulnerability to maintain control over a system is a common part of the Execution phase.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript) -> Defense Evasion (T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories) -> Maintaining Access (exploitation of CVE-2019-8605). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred immediately after the execution of the backdoor, so the answer is Execution (T1059.007-JavaScript).
