 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading.
2. The related TTPs mention the tactics of Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion, but these tactics typically occur after Initial Access has been established.
3. The Tactic: Initial Access is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an attacker gains access to a system. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including deploying a dropper executable via DLL sideloading.
4. The TTP T1080-Taint Shared Content and T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading are techniques used in the Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion tactics, respectively. These techniques are used to move within a network and evade detection, which suggests that the attacker has already gained Initial Access.
5. The other answer choices (Exfiltration and Execution) are not likely to occur before Initial Access, as Exfiltration involves moving data out of a system, and Execution involves running malware, both of which require Initial Access.
