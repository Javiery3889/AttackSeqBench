 Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Konni APT used obfuscated scripts to manage the deletion of evidence, such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'. This action falls under the Defense Evasion tactic (T1070) and the specific technique T1070.004 - File Deletion.

2. The question then asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this action. The related TTPs do not provide any information about Discovery (T1086) or Impact (T1088) tactics, which would not typically follow the deletion of evidence.

3. The remaining tactic is Lateral Movement (T1021), which involves an attacker moving from one compromised system to another within a network. This tactic often follows the deletion of evidence to cover the attacker's tracks and prepare for further actions, such as Discovery or Impact.

4. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details. The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details is a Discovery technique (T1086.001), which typically occurs after Lateral Movement when the attacker has moved to another system and wants to gather more information about it.

5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Defense Evasion (T1070) -> Lateral Movement (T1021) -> Discovery (T1086). Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after Defense Evasion and before Discovery, the answer is Lateral Movement (T1021).
