 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.
2. The related TTPs mention the use of a lure document with a malicious macro (T1192) and PowerShell commands (T1059).
3. The sequence of TTPs can be inferred as follows:
   - Initial Access (T1078) - The attacker gains access to the system through a lure document with a malicious macro (T1192).
   - Execution (T1059) - The attacker executes PowerShell commands upon gaining access to the system.
   - Post-Exploitation (T1061) - The attacker then employs obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload, which is a technique often used for maintaining persistence or command and control (C2) within the system.
4. However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the Post-Exploitation stage, the answer is the Initial Access tactic (T1078). The Execution tactic (T1059) is a part of the Initial Access stage as well, but it is not the tactic that occurred before the Post-Exploitation stage in this sequence.
