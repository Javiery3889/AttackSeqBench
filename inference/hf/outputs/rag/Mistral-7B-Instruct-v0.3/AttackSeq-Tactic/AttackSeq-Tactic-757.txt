 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Emissary Panda performed reconnaissance to facilitate their exploitation of Microsoft SharePoint.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the Initial Access was achieved through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190), and the Lateral Movement tactic was used for exploitation of remote services (T1210).
3. After successfully exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144), Emissary Panda would have gained access to the system. However, to move within the network and potentially escalate privileges, they would need to use the Lateral Movement tactic.
4. Privilege Escalation (A) is a tactic used to gain higher-level access within a system, but it typically follows the Lateral Movement tactic, not the other way around. Execution (C) is the tactic used to run a command or script on a compromised system, which is not directly related to moving within the network. Initial Access (D) is the tactic used to gain the first foothold into a system, which has already been achieved through the exploitation of the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1190) -> Reconnaissance (T1087) -> Lateral Movement (T1210).
