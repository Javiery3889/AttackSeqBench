 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers executed a malicious DLL using legitimate program executables to launch a backdoor binary blob.
2. The related TTPs provided include Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading, which is a method used to maintain access to a compromised system.
3. Tactic: Initial Access refers to the first step in an attack where an attacker gains access to a system. Tactic: Execution refers to the act of running code on a target system, which has already occurred in the question. Tactic: Defense Evasion is a method used to avoid detection, and Tactic: Lateral Movement refers to the spread of an attack from one system to another within a network.
4. Given that the attackers have already executed the malicious DLL and launched a backdoor, it is most likely that they would want to persist on the system to maintain access for future activities. Therefore, the most plausible answer is Tactic: Persistence.
