 Final Answer: Lateral Movement (Tactic: T1021)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after initial access and before persistence.
2. Initial Access (Tactic: T1078) is the first step in the attack chain, which has already been achieved through the exploitation of a Microsoft Office 2013 vulnerability.
3. Command and Control (Tactic: T1053) and Discovery (Tactic: T1086) are tactics that can occur at various stages of the attack, but they do not necessarily follow the initial access and persistence steps in this context.
4. Execution (Tactic: T1059) is the tactic that involves the execution of the malware after initial access, but it does not specify the lateral movement within the network, which is indicated by the related TTP T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
5. Persistence (Tactic: T1098) is the tactic that occurs after the malware has achieved its objectives and wants to maintain its presence in the network, which is represented by the related TTP T1543.003-Windows Service. However, persistence has not been mentioned as the tactic that occurred after the initial access and before persistence in the question.
6. Lateral Movement (Tactic: T1021) is the tactic that describes the malware's propagation within the network, which is indicated by the related TTP T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services. This tactic occurs after the initial access and before persistence, making it the most plausible answer.
