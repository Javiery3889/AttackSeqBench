 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Tickusb infected systems via USB flash drives but before it evaded detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot.

2. From the related TTPs, we can see that Tickusb uses the T1091 technique for Initial Access and Lateral Movement, which means it infects systems through removable media. However, the question asks for a tactic that occurs after the initial access.

3. The Tactic: Execution is the next logical step after Initial Access, as it involves the malware running on the infected system.

4. The Tactic: Discovery, Privilege Escalation, and Exfiltration are not directly related to the execution of the malware on the infected system, making them less likely to occur before evasion techniques.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1091) -> Execution (T1056) -> Lateral Movement (T1021) -> Evasion (T1036). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred between the initial infection and the evasion, the answer is Execution (T1056).
