 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access but before the establishment of persistence.
2. The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
3. The related TTPs mention the Persistence tactic and the Shortcut Modification technique (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification).
4. The Powersing implant established persistence through a Windows startup folder shortcut, which is a form of shortcut modification (T1547.009).
5. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access but before the establishment of persistence, the only remaining tactic is Persistence.
6. The related TTP of Shortcut Modification (T1547.009) is a technique under the Persistence tactic, making it the most plausible sequence of TTPs.
7. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access but before the establishment of persistence through a Windows startup folder shortcut is Persistence.
