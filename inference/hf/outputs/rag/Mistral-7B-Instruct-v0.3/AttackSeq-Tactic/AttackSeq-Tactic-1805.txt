 Final Answer: C: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the execution of scripts and batch files, which aligns with the Tactic: Execution.
2. The TTPs provided include T1059.001-PowerShell, which is a technique under the Execution tactic that involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.
3. The attack sequence described in the question starts with Initial Access, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial access. So, Initial Access (B) is not the correct answer.
4. The question also mentions registry modifications, which aligns with the Tactic: Persistence. However, the TTPs provided do not include any Persistence techniques that involve script or batch file execution before registry modifications.
5. The Tactic: Impact is not related to the execution of scripts or batch files or registry modifications, so it can be ruled out.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (B) -> Execution (C) -> Persistence (D), but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the execution of scripts and batch files, which is the Execution (C) tactic.
