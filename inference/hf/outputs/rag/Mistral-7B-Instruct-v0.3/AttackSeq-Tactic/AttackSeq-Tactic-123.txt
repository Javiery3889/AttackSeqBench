 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. After Surtr malware performed actions such as listing file directories, executing remote commands, and logging keystrokes, it connected to '3-a.net' on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which involves the use of multiple stages in a command and control (C2) channel.
3. The Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery, is related to the initial actions of the malware, but it does not directly involve connecting to a C2 server and downloading a stage two component.
4. The Tactic: Initial Access, while important for the initial infection, does not typically involve C2 communication or downloading additional components after the initial infection.
5. The Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging, is related to the actions of logging keystrokes, but it does not directly involve connecting to a C2 server or downloading additional components.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (for the initial infection), Collection (for logging keystrokes), and Command and Control (for connecting to the C2 server and downloading a stage two component). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred as it connected to the internet, the answer is D: Command and Control.
