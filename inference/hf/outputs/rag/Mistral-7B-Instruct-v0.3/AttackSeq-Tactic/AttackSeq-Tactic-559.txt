 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that QuasarRAT has been created a scheduled task using a .NET wrapper DLL to maintain persistence. This action falls under the Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task. However, this technique is about establishing persistence on the compromised system, not about the malware beaconing over an encrypted connection.

2. The question also mentions that the malware is beaconing over an encrypted connection to the threat actor's domain. This action is related to the Tactic: Command and Control.

3. The Tactic: Command and Control involves the malware communicating with the threat actor's infrastructure, which includes beaconing over an encrypted connection.

4. Since the question asks about the most likely tactic when the malware began beaconing over an encrypted connection, the most plausible answer is D: Command and Control. The other tactics mentioned in the answer choices (Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access) do not directly relate to the malware beaconing over an encrypted connection.
