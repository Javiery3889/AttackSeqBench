 Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next involving external communication on port 443 and references to internal IP addresses.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the initial discovery was made using registry queries and system network configuration discovery.
3. After discovering the victim machines, the attacker would likely perform lateral movement to move within the network, which often involves communication over external channels (such as port 443) and referencing internal IP addresses to locate other systems.
4. Command and Control (A) and Initial Access (B) are not the most likely choices because they typically occur before Discovery. Lateral Movement (D) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after Discovery, as it involves communication and IP address referencing, as mentioned in the question.
