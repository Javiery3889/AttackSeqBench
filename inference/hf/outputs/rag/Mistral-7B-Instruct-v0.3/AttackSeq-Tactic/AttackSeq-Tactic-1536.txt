 Final Answer: C: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely preceded the lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations.
2. The related TTPs mention the techniques T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer), which are both lateral movement techniques. This suggests that the lateral movement has already started.
3. To perform lateral movement, an attacker needs to have access to the compromised systems, which is typically achieved through the Credential Access tactic.
4. Resource Development, Defense Evasion, and Discovery are tactics that are more focused on initial access, maintaining access, and gathering information about the target environment, respectively. While these tactics could be part of the overall attack sequence, they do not directly lead to the lateral movement efforts described in the question.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Credential Access (to gain access to the network) -> Discovery (to gather information about the network) -> Defense Evasion (to evade detection) -> Resource Development (to create additional access points) -> Lateral Movement (to move within the network). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely preceded the lateral movement, the answer is C: Credential Access.
