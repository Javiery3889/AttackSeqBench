 Final Answer: A: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely followed the execution of the Milestone backdoor's system information and file discovery capabilities.
2. The Related TTPs indicate that the tactic of Persistence was used, specifically the technique T1543.003 - Windows Service. However, this technique is about establishing persistence, not about system information and file discovery.
3. The Milestone backdoor's system information and file discovery capabilities are part of the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
4. Therefore, the tactic that most likely followed the execution of the Milestone backdoor's system information and file discovery capabilities is the Discovery tactic.
