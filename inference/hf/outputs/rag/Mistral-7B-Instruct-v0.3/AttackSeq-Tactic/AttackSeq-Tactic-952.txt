 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443. This action is typically associated with establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel, as it allows the attacker to communicate with the compromised system without raising suspicion.

2. The related TTPs also support the choice of Command and Control. The technique T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation suggests that the attacker might have used a protocol or service that mimics a legitimate one to evade detection. In this case, the attacker could have used SSL traffic on port 443 to blend with normal traffic.

3. T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography are also related to Command and Control. Using a non-standard port (T1571) for C2 communication can help evade detection, while symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) is often used to encrypt C2 traffic to secure the communication channel.

4. The tactic of Discovery (A) is about gathering information about the target environment, which doesn't necessarily follow the encryption and blending of network communications. Defense Evasion (C) and Persistence (D) are tactics that could occur after establishing a C2 channel, but the specific TTPs mentioned in the question and related TTPs suggest that Command and Control (B) is the most plausible tactic that occurred after the encrypted network communications.
