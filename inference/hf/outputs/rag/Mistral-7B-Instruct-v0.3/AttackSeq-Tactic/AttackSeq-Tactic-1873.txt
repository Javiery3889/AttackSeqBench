 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the Octopus malware has already gathered system information using WMIC.exe, which is a technique under the Discovery tactic (T1082 - System Information Discovery).
2. The question then asks for the next most likely tactic after this system information gathering.
3. The related TTPs provided do not include Lateral Movement (T1021), Defense Evasion (T1135), or any other tactics that would suggest a different sequence of events.
4. The remaining tactic is Command and Control (T1053), which involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive commands, such as file uploads or downloads, after it has gathered system information.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (T1082) -> Command and Control (T1053).
