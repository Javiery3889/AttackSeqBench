 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access but before achieving persistence.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190).
3. The tactic that follows the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is Discovery, where an attacker gathers information about the target environment. However, in this case, the question specifies that persistence has not yet been achieved, which means the attacker has not yet established a long-term presence in the target system.
4. Execution (T1059) and Persistence (T1070) are tactics that occur after the Discovery phase, as they involve running commands or scripts and establishing a long-term presence, respectively.
5. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D: Initial Access, as it is the tactic that occurred after gaining access through exploiting public-facing applications but before executing commands or establishing persistence.
