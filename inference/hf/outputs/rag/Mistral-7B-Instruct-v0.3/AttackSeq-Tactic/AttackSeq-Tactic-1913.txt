 Final Answer: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after NanHaiShu used techniques to hinder detection of the decoy XLS and JScript file.
2. The related TTPs provided all fall under the "Defense Evasion" tactic, which is used to evade detection by hiding the presence of the attack or the actions taken during the attack.
3. The techniques mentioned in the question, such as base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation, are part of the "Encrypted/Encoded File" (T1027.013) and "Command Obfuscation" (T1027.010) sub-techniques under the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be "Defense Evasion" (T1027) after NanHaiShu used techniques to hinder detection of the decoy XLS and JScript file. This is because these techniques are used to evade detection, and the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after these techniques were used.
