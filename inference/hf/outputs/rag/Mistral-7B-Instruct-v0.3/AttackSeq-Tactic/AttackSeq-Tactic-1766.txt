 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that phishing emails and social engineering techniques were used to establish backdoors within the bank's network. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic (Tactic: Initial Access). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this initial access, so we can rule out the Initial Access tactic as the answer.

2. The question also mentions the installation of a legitimate monitoring tool like 'Mipko' to capture screen and keystroke information, which is part of the Post-Exploitation phase. The Impact tactic (Tactic: Impact) is typically associated with actions that cause data destruction or disruption, which is not the case here.

3. The Resource Development tactic (Tactic: Resource Development) is about creating, acquiring, or maintaining resources for future use, such as tools, infrastructure, or credentials. While it could be a part of the attack sequence, it does not directly follow the establishment of backdoors, and it is not the tactic that would lead to the installation of a monitoring tool like Mipko.

4. The Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution) is about executing the attacker's objectives, which could include installing malware or other tools for data exfiltration or surveillance. The installation of Mipko to capture screen and keystroke information on the card management application network fits well within this tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (T1566-Phishing or T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) -> Defense Evasion (T1656-Impersonation, if applicable) -> Execution (installation of Mipko).
