 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker first employed techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and targeted unsecured credentials for credential harvesting (Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001).
3. The attacker's goal in these initial steps is to gain access to the system and harvest credentials, which is a part of the Reconnaissance phase as they are gathering information about the target environment.
4. Once the attacker has the necessary credentials, they can move on to the Discovery phase to gather more detailed information about the network and host configurations using native OS binaries and custom malware (Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1086).
5. Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control) is a tactic used to maintain persistence and communication between the attacker and compromised systems, which typically occurs after the attacker has gained access and gathered initial information.
6. Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) is the initial phase where an attacker gathers information about the target before launching an attack, which aligns with the initial steps of process memory dumping and credential harvesting in this case.
7. Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access) is a tactic used to steal or dump credentials, which is what the attacker did in the initial steps, but it does not necessarily imply that the attacker has moved on to the Discovery phase yet.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) -> Credential Access (Tactic: Credential Access) -> Discovery (Tactic: Discovery).
