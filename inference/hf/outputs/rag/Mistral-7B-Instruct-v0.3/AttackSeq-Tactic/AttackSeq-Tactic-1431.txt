 Final Answer: C: Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The StellarParticle campaign used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access. This sequence of TTPs suggests that the attacker has already gained some level of initial access (B) to the network, possibly through phishing or exploiting a vulnerability.

2. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after these initial actions. The related TTPs provided, T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1482-Domain Trust Discovery, both fall under the Discovery tactic.

3. The Discovery tactic involves the collection of information about the target environment to understand its capabilities, vulnerabilities, and layout. This is a logical next step after identifying systems for access, as the attacker would want to gather more information about the network to plan their further actions.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (B) -> Gathering Active Directory information (using AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools) -> Discovery (C). The Discovery tactic is the most likely tactic to occur after the initial access and information gathering, as it provides the attacker with a deeper understanding of the target environment.
