 Final Answer: B: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that data has been collected and prepared for exfiltration, which aligns with the Tactic: Exfiltration.
2. The data is being exfiltrated over C2 channels, which is a technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
3. The C2 servers used are multiple and randomly chosen, which does not align with the tactics of Discovery (A) or Persistence (C).
4. The use of a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation is not typically associated with the tactic of Command and Control (D), but it can be a part of the Exfiltration process to evade detection.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Tactic: Exfiltration (B) -> Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (related TTP) -> Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method (not explicitly mentioned in the question but could be a part of the exfiltration process).
