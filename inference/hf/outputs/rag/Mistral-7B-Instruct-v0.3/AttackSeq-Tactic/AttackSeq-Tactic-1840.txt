 Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that GreyEnergy obtained domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords with Mimikatz, which falls under the Privilege Escalation tactic (T1078.002-Domain Accounts). However, this action is not the primary focus of the question.
2. The question then mentions the use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network. This action is more indicative of the Lateral Movement tactic (T1021).
3. The related TTPs provided also support the Lateral Movement tactic, as it mentions the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe (T1021.001 and T1021.003 respectively).
4. The Resource Development tactic (T1588.002-Tool) is not directly related to the action of spreading across the network, but rather the development of tools for future use.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Privilege Escalation (T1078.002-Domain Accounts) to obtain domain administrator privileges, followed by Lateral Movement (T1021) to spread across the network using PsExec and WinExe.
