 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already gathered information about the victim's computer and sent it to a remote server. This action aligns with the Discovery tactic, but it is not the most likely next step in the attack sequence.

2. The Impact tactic typically involves actions that cause harm or disrupt the victim's system, which is not suggested in the given scenario.

3. The Exfiltration tactic usually follows the collection of sensitive data, but in this case, the question does not mention any data exfiltration after the initial information gathering.

4. The most plausible next step after gathering information and establishing a connection to the victim's computer is to maintain persistent access for further commands, which is the Command and Control tactic. The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a technique (T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) that is often associated with Command and Control activities. Therefore, the most likely next step in the attack sequence is Command and Control.
