 Final Answer: Command and Control (C)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: Taidoor used identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses in GET and POST requests for HTTP communication. This suggests that the attacker is communicating with the victim system and possibly establishing a connection or maintaining a foothold.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs: The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (C2) tactic and the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001). This indicates that the attacker is using web protocols for command and control communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial communication but before the malware uploaded files to the C&C server for exfiltration. The Exfiltration tactic (D) would typically come after the Command and Control tactic, as the attacker would need to establish a connection and issue commands before exfiltrating data. The Impact (A) and Defense Evasion (B) tactics are not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Taidoor uses identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses in GET and POST requests for HTTP communication (Establishing a connection or maintaining a foothold).
   - Command and Control (C2) communication is established using web protocols (T1071.001).
   - The attacker issues commands for the malware to upload files to the C&C server for exfiltration (Exfiltration over C2 Channel).

Therefore, the final answer is Command and Control (C).
