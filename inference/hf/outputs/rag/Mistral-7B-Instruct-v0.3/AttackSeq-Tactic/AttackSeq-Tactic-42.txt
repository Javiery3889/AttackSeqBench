 Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after ScarCruft employed phishing emails containing Office documents to compromise host systems and load further malicious scripts using Office Macro.
2. The related TTPs provided mention the Execution tactic (T1204.002) and the Initial Access tactic (T1566.001). However, the question asks for a tactic that occurred after the Initial Access, which was already achieved through the phishing attack.
3. The remaining options are Lateral Movement (A), Command and Control (D), and Execution (C). Since the question asks for a tactic that occurs after the Initial Access, it is unlikely that the Execution tactic would follow immediately after the Initial Access, as execution of malicious scripts is typically part of the Initial Access phase.
4. Command and Control (C) is a tactic that is usually employed after the Initial Access and Execution phases to maintain persistence and command the compromised system. However, the question does not provide any information about maintaining persistence or commanding the compromised system, so it is not the most plausible answer.
5. Lateral Movement (A) is a tactic that involves moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. Since the question mentions the compromise of host systems, it is likely that ScarCruft would move laterally within the network to further compromise other systems.
6. Therefore, the most plausible answer is Lateral Movement (A).
