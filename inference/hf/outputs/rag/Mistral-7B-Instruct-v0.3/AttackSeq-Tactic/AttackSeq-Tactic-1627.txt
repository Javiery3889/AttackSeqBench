 Final Answer: B: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Grabit malware was delivered via a malicious macro in a Microsoft Office Word document, which falls under the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File. This is the Initial Access phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. After Initial Access, the next logical step would be to establish persistence on the compromised system, but the question does not mention any persistence mechanism yet.

3. The malware is then described as including keylogger functionality to collect usernames and passwords, which falls under the Tactic: Credential Access.

4. Privilege Escalation (A) is a tactic used to gain higher levels of access on a system, which is not mentioned as a step between Initial Access and Credential Access in this scenario.

5. Persistence (D) is a tactic used to ensure the malware remains on the system after reboots or other actions that might otherwise remove it. However, since the question does not mention any persistence mechanism, it is less likely to have occurred before the keylogger functionality was added.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is: Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) -> Credential Access (T1087-Keylogger).
