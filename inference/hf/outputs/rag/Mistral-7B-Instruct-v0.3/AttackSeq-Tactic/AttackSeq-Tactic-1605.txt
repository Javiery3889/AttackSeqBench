 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that the attackers opened spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links to gain initial access. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic (Tactic: Initial Access).
2. The related TTPs mention T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, both of which are Initial Access techniques. This further supports the Initial Access tactic.
3. However, the question also mentions that the attackers utilized an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection. This suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access and are now executing their next steps to evade detection, which aligns with the Execution tactic (Tactic: Execution).
4. Reconnaissance (Tactic: Reconnaissance) and Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) are less likely as they typically occur before Initial Access and Execution, respectively.
