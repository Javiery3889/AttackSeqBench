 Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents utilizing the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.

2. The related TTPs provided, Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1221-Template Injection, and Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, help us understand the context of the question.

3. T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment is the Initial Access tactic, which is the first step in an attack sequence. The attackers used this technique to gain access to the victim's system.

4. T1221-Template Injection is a Defense Evasion technique, which means the attackers are trying to hide their activities by using a remote template to create the malicious DOCX document. This technique is often used after Initial Access to maintain persistence or move laterally within the network.

5. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the Initial Access, so the most plausible answer would be a tactic that follows Initial Access. Among the given answer choices, Lateral Movement (C) is the tactic that typically follows Initial Access and is often used to move within the network to reach other systems or data.

6. Exfiltration (D) is a tactic used to steal data, but it usually comes after Lateral Movement when the attackers have moved to the systems containing the data they want to steal. Execution (A) and Initial Access (B) are not likely to occur after the Initial Access tactic in this sequence.

Therefore, the final answer is C: Lateral Movement.
