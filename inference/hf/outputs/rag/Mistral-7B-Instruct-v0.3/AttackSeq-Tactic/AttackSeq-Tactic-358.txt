 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor established communication with the C2 servers. This action is related to the Command and Control (Tactic) T1071.004-DNS and T1572-Protocol Tunneling.
2. The question mentions that the collected data is being transferred. This action is related to the Exfiltration (Tactic) T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
3. The sequence of events suggests that after establishing communication, the next logical step would be to transfer data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
4. Resource Development (A) and Lateral Movement (D) are not directly related to the transfer of data in this context. Command and Control (B) is related to the establishment of communication, but not specifically to the transfer of data. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1071.004-DNS (Command and Control) for establishing communication using DNS.
   - T1572-Protocol Tunneling (Command and Control) for using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Exfiltration) for transferring the collected data.
