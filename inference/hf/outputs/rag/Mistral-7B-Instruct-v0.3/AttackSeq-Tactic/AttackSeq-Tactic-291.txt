 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C traffic and communicates with C&C via Tor. This action aligns with the related Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography, which involves using encryption to secure communication between the attacker and the compromised system.

2. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next as the stolen data was sent to its C&C server. The related Tactic: Exfiltration is not mentioned in the initial action but is relevant to the question since it involves the theft and transfer of data from a compromised system.

3. The technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is also related to the Tactic: Exfiltration and is a common method for transferring stolen data through the already established C2 channel.

4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Tactic: Command and Control (initial communication)
   - Tactic: Exfiltration (transfer of stolen data)

5. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next, the final answer is C: Exfiltration.
