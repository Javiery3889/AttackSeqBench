 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that initial access has already been gained through a specific exploit (CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash). This means that the Initial Access tactic (D) has already occurred.
2. The question mentions the use of the Poison Ivy RAT, which is a remote access trojan. This RAT requires Command and Control (C2) communication to function, allowing an attacker to control the compromised system remotely.
3. The related TTPs do not mention Exfiltration (B) or Persistence (A) at this stage, as the question specifically asks about the next step after initial access.
4. The communication with domains such as diff.qohub.info is a common method for C2 communication in the context of a RAT like Poison Ivy.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (D) -> Command and Control (C). The communication with the domain (diff.qohub.info) is a part of the Command and Control tactic (C).
