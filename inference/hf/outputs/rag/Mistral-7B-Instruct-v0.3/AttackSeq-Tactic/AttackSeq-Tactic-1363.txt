 Final Answer: B: Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that attackers used malicious documents and malicious links to entice victims. This action aligns with the Execution tactic, specifically Technique T1204.001 (Malicious Link) and T1204.002 (Malicious File).
2. The question does not provide any information about Initial Access (T1566), Lateral Movement, or Reconnaissance tactics.
3. Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial enticement, the most plausible answer is the Execution tactic, as it directly follows the action of sending malicious documents and links (Reconnaissance would typically occur before Initial Access).
4. The provided Related TTPs further support the Execution tactic, as they describe the use of malicious links and files, which are techniques under the Execution tactic.

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the attackers enticed victims with malicious documents is the Execution tactic.
