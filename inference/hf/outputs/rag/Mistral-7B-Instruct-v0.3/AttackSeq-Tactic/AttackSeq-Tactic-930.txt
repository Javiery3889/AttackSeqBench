 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already decrypted obfuscated registry content, which is a Defense Evasion technique (T1027).
2. Deploying the njRAT remote access tool is a common method for establishing Command and Control (C2) over compromised systems.
3. Resource Development (T1135) would typically occur earlier in an attack sequence, such as gathering information to customize the malware or preparing the environment for further attacks.
4. Initial Access (T1078) is the first step in an attack sequence, where the attacker gains access to a system. Since the attacker has already gained access (by decrypting the registry content), Initial Access is not the most likely tactic to occur after deploying the njRAT.
5. Defense Evasion techniques are used to hide the presence of the attacker or the malware, but deploying the njRAT is a clear indication that the attacker wants to maintain persistent access to the system, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Defense Evasion (T1027) -> Initial Access (T1078) -> Command and Control (T1057). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after deploying the njRAT, the answer is Command and Control (T1057).
