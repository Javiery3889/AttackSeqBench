 Final Answer: Persistence

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that BlackEnergy 3 malware executed a Visual Basic macro embedded in an Excel document. This action falls under the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005.
2. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of the Visual Basic macro but before BlackEnergy 3 employed RegSetValueExw() to register FONTCACHE.DAT for execution upon system startup.
3. The tactic of Command and Control (T1071) and Reconnaissance (T1078) are not typically performed after the initial execution of malware, as they are more about maintaining communication with the command and control server and gathering information about the target environment, respectively.
4. Defense Evasion (T1564) is a tactic that is used to avoid detection by security solutions, and it is not directly related to persistence or registering a file for execution upon system startup.
5. Persistence (T1053) is the tactic that involves establishing a mechanism to ensure the malware remains on the system after a reboot. Registering FONTCACHE.DAT for execution upon system startup is a common persistence technique.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Execution (T1059.005) -> Persistence (T1053).
