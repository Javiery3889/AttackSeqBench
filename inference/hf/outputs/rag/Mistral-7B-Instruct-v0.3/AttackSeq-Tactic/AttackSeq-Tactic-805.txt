 Final Answer: D: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the creation of a Windows system service, which is a form of persistence (Tactic: Persistence).
2. The related TTPs include Tactic: Command and Control, which involves establishing a connection to a remote server for further instructions.
3. The communication with domains like rainydaysweb[.]com over non-standard ports 80, 443, 53, and 8000 is a common method used in Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Non-Standard Port).
4. Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration) typically involves sending data out of the compromised system, which doesn't directly involve communication with a command and control server.
5. Defense Evasion (Tactic: Defense Evasion) and Discovery (Tactic: Discovery) are not directly related to the communication with domains over non-standard ports mentioned in the question.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Persistence (T1543.003) -> Command and Control (T1571).
