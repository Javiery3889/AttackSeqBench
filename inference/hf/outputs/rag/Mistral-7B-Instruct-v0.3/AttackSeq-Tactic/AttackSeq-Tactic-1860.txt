 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before Deep Panda executed PowerShell scripts and batch files.
2. The related TTPs mention the Execution tactic, specifically Technique T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell) and T1059.001 (PowerShell). These techniques are about executing commands, not gaining initial access.
3. However, to execute commands, an attacker must first gain access to the system. Therefore, the Initial Access tactic is the most likely precursor to the Execution tactic in this scenario.
4. The other answer choices (Persistence, Credential Access) are not directly related to the initial execution of commands, making them less likely to have occurred before the Execution tactic.

In summary, the Initial Access tactic is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before Deep Panda executed PowerShell scripts and batch files.
