 Final Answer: Collection

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. The question states that a JavaScript dropper (T1059.007) has been used to infect a system and fingerprint it. This action is typically part of the Discovery phase, but since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the fingerprinting, we can rule out Discovery.
2. The next tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework after Discovery is Execution, which includes techniques for executing files, scripts, and macros. However, the question specifies that the JavaScript dropper has already been executed, so Execution is not the most likely answer.
3. Defense Evasion is a tactic used to avoid detection by hiding or obfuscating malicious activity. Since the question does not mention any attempts to evade detection, Defense Evasion is not the most likely answer.
4. The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols. This technique is often used in the Command and Control phase, where an attacker establishes communication with the compromised system.
5. The final tactic left is Collection, which includes techniques for stealing data from the compromised system. The KopiLuwak backdoor communicating with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests (T1071.001) is a common technique in the Collection phase.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Discovery (T1018) -> Execution (T1059.007) -> Collection (T1086) -> Command and Control (T1071.001). However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the JavaScript dropper and before the KopiLuwak backdoor, the most likely answer is Collection.
