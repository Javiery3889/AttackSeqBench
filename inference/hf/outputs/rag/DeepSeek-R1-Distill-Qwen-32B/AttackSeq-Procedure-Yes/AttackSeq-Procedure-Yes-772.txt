Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about whether recipients of spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents exploiting a specific CVE will be shown a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT. The answer choices are Yes or No.

First, I need to break down the question. Spear phishing emails are a common initial access vector. The emails contain links to RTF documents, which are known to be used in exploiting vulnerabilities. The specific CVE mentioned is CVE-2017-8750, which I recall is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically in the Equation Editor. This vulnerability was exploited by attackers to deliver malware, like QuasarRAT in this case.

So, the attack sequence starts with sending spear phishing emails. The emails have links, not attachments, which is important. The links lead to RTF documents that exploit the CVE. Once the exploit is successful, the payload, which is QuasarRAT, is delivered.

Now, the question is whether the recipients will see a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected. I think this is about the social engineering aspect of the phishing campaign. Attackers often use convincing content to trick users into opening the document. If the RTF document is crafted to look like a legitimate document, it increases the chances of the user interacting with it, which is necessary for the exploit to work.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: the tactics are Execution and Initial Access. The techniques are T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) and T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment). Since the question mentions links, T1566.002 is relevant here. 

In the context of spear phishing, the use of a link to an RTF document suggests that the attackers are trying to bypass email attachment restrictions. The RTF file, once opened, would likely display content that appears legitimate to trick the user into enabling macros or interacting with the document, which then triggers the exploit.

So, putting it together: the spear phishing email contains a link to an RTF document. The RTF is designed to look like a legitimate document, such as a blog post or report, to deceive the recipient. When the user opens it, the exploit (CVE-2017-8750) is triggered, leading to the execution of QuasarRAT.

Therefore, it's likely that the recipients would see a document that looks legitimate before the infection happens. So the answer should be Yes.

The question involves a spear phishing campaign using links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT. The analysis considers the tactics and techniques involved, including the use of legitimate-looking documents to deceive recipients. Given the nature of such attacks, it is plausible that the RTF document would simulate a legitimate blog post or report to increase the likelihood of user interaction, leading to the exploit. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
