Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the shellcode after privilege escalation using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll will contact its C&C at a specific URL and resolve a domain to an IP address. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Metasploit is a popular penetration testing framework, and the module mentioned here is ext_server_priv.x86.dll. From what I remember, this module is used for privilege escalation, specifically through DLL injection. DLL injection is a technique where an attacker injects a DLL into another process to execute malicious code, which is part of the T1055.001 technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. So, the initial step here is about gaining higher privileges on the system.

Now, the question is about what happens after this privilege escalation. The shellcode, which is the malicious payload, is supposed to contact a command and control (C&C) server at a specific URL: https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ. Additionally, it's said to resolve the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91. 

Looking at the related TTPs provided, there are two main tactics: Privilege Escalation and Command and Control. The techniques mentioned are T1055.001 (DLL injection) and T1102.001 (Dead Drop Resolver). 

T1055.001 is about dynamic-link library injection, which we've already established as the method used for privilege escalation. The other technique, T1102.001, is about Dead Drop Resolver. From what I understand, Dead Drop Resolver is a method where the malware uses a legitimate domain's DNS records to retrieve the actual C&C IP address. This is a way to avoid using hard-coded IP addresses, making it harder for defenders to block the communication.

So, putting this together, after the DLL injection for privilege escalation, the next step would involve establishing command and control. The shellcode would need to communicate with the C&C server. If the technique T1102.001 is involved, the shellcode would likely resolve a domain to an IP address, which is exactly what the question describes: resolving psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to 209.239.115[.]91.

Therefore, the sequence makes sense. The attacker uses DLL injection to escalate privileges, then uses a dead drop resolver technique to get the C&C IP, and then contacts the server. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The sequence of events aligns with the use of DLL injection for privilege escalation followed by a dead drop resolver technique to contact the C&C server. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
