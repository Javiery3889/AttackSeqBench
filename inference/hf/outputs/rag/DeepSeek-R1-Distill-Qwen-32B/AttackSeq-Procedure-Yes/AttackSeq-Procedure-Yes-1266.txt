Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Blind Eagle's attack sequence involves the specific steps described in the question. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking if Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader that employs ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands from Discord CDNs for initial access. Then, it checks if they use a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, I see two techniques under the Execution tactic: T1059.001 for PowerShell and T1059.005 for Visual Basic. This tells me that the attack likely involves both PowerShell and VBScript execution.

The attack sequence described in the question starts with a JavaScript downloader. JavaScript is often used in initial access because it can be embedded in web pages or scripts. Using ActiveXObject makes sense because it's a way to interact with COM objects in older versions of Internet Explorer, which can be used to execute other scripts like PowerShell.

Next, the downloader executes PowerShell commands from Discord CDNs. I know that CDNs are used to host legitimate content, but attackers sometimes abuse them to host malicious scripts. Using Discord CDNs specifically might be a way to blend in with normal traffic, making detection harder.

After initial access, the attack uses a VBScript in the Startup folder. VBScript is another common scripting language used in attacks, and placing a script in the Startup folder is a typical persistence mechanism. The script then executes SystemLogin.bat, which is a batch file. Batch files can perform various tasks, including running commands or scripts, which could be part of the persistence or further attack steps.

Now, considering the related TTPs, both PowerShell and VBScript execution are mentioned. The attack sequence described uses both, so that aligns with the TTPs. The initial access via JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell fits the T1059.001 technique. Then, using VBScript for persistence fits T1059.005.

I don't see any red flags here. The sequence makes sense: initial access via a script, execution of PowerShell, then persistence with VBScript. The use of CDNs is also a common tactic to avoid detection. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, the attack sequence does involve these steps.

The attack sequence described aligns with the provided TTPs, as it involves both PowerShell and VBScript execution, which are listed under the Execution tactic. The use of a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject for initial access and VBScript for persistence fits the techniques mentioned.

Final Answer: A: Yes
