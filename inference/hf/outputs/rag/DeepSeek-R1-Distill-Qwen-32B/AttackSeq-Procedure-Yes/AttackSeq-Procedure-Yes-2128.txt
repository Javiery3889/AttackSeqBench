Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'stopedge.bat' script would delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after they've been used. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that 'versioninfo.bat' is used to gather system details and collect information for exfiltration. That makes sense because scripts like these are often used in attacks to gather data. The next part is about whether 'stopedge.bat' would delete these files to evade detection.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two main ones: Execution using the Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) and Defense Evasion through File Deletion (T1070.004). So, the attack is using batch scripts, which are executed via the command shell, and then possibly deleting files to cover tracks.

In many cyberattacks, after an initial script (like 'versioninfo.bat') has done its job, attackers often use another script to clean up. This cleanup is a common tactic to remove evidence and avoid detection. So, 'stopedge.bat' could be that cleanup script.

I think about how these scripts work. 'versioninfo.bat' would run commands to gather info, maybe using 'systeminfo' or other commands. Once the data is collected, the attacker doesn't need the script anymore, so deleting it makes sense. Similarly, 'update.vbs' might be a VBScript used in the attack, so deleting it would help hide the attack.

The TTPs support this because T1070.004 specifically talks about deleting files as part of defense evasion. So, using a script to delete these files aligns with known tactics.

I don't see any reason why 'stopedge.bat' wouldn't delete these files. It's a logical step in the attack lifecycle to remove traces after exfiltration. So, the answer should be yes.

The scenario involves two scripts: 'versioninfo.bat' for gathering system information and 'stopedge.bat' for potential cleanup. The related TTPs indicate the use of batch scripts (Execution via Command Shell) and file deletion (Defense Evasion). Attackers commonly delete scripts post-use to evade detection, aligning with T1070.004. Thus, 'stopedge.bat' likely deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.

Final Answer: A: Yes
