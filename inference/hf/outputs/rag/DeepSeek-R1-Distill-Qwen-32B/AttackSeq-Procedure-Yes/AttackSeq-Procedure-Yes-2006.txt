Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about whether, after some reconnaissance activities, a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with a Command-and-Control (C2) server after being installed via an employee-enabled macro. The answer choices are just Yes or No.

First, I need to break down the question. The attack sequence starts with reconnaissance, which includes gathering publicly available information and active discovery methods. Then, the implant is installed through a macro, and the question is whether it will communicate with a C2 server.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: the tactics are both under Discovery. The techniques are T1018 (Remote System Discovery) and T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery). So, these are about discovering other systems on the network and understanding network connections.

Now, I should think about how BlackEnergy 3 operates. From what I remember, BlackEnergy is a malware used in targeted attacks, often for espionage or sabotage. It's known to use macros in documents as a delivery method. Once it's installed, it typically communicates with a C2 server to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

The question is whether it's likely that after the initial reconnaissance, the implant will establish communication. Since the TTPs mentioned are about discovery, which is a preliminary step, the next logical step would be establishing communication. So, after gathering information, the malware would likely reach out to its C2 server.

I should also consider the attack lifecycle. Typically, after initial access (which is the macro execution here), the next steps are discovery, then lateral movement, and then exfiltration or other objectives. But even before lateral movement, the implant would need to communicate with the C2 to get further instructions.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Yes because the malware's next step after installation is to communicate with the C2 server, which is a common behavior for such implants.

The question revolves around whether a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3, after being installed via a macro, will communicate with a C2 server following reconnaissance activities. The related TTPs focus on discovery techniques, which are preliminary steps in an attack. BlackEnergy 3 is known to use macros for initial access and typically communicates with a C2 server post-installation. This communication is essential for receiving commands or exfiltrating data, aligning with the expected attack lifecycle. Therefore, it is likely that the implant will establish C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
