Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the StellarParticle campaign used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP during lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the campaign used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery. AdFind is a tool used for querying Active Directory information, which falls under the Discovery tactic, specifically T1482 for Domain Trust Discovery. This makes sense because understanding the domain structure is crucial for lateral movement.

Next, the question is about lateral movement using RDP. The related TTPs include T1021.001, which is Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP is a common method for lateral movement, especially in Windows environments. Now, the key here is whether they used both privileged and non-privileged accounts.

In many cyberattacks, especially those involving lateral movement, attackers often escalate privileges after initial access. They might use non-privileged accounts to move laterally initially, then switch to privileged accounts once they gain higher access. This approach helps them avoid detection and allows them to access more sensitive areas.

Given that the campaign already performed discovery activities, it's logical that they would use RDP with both types of accounts. Using non-privileged accounts first to move through less sensitive areas and then escalating to privileged accounts when accessing critical systems or data repositories makes the attack more stealthy and effective.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, they likely used both types of accounts for RDP during lateral movement.

The StellarParticle campaign utilized discovery techniques to gather Active Directory information, which is essential for planning lateral movement. Given the use of RDP (T1021.001) as a lateral movement technique, it's plausible they used both privileged and non-privileged accounts to move through the network, escalating privileges as needed. This approach aligns with typical attack patterns for stealth and effectiveness.

Final Answer: A: Yes
