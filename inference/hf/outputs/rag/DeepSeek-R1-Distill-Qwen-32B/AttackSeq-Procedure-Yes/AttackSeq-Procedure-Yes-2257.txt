Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack sequence described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT) delivered a file called COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip. This is part of the Initial Access phase. Phishing emails are a common method for initial access because they trick users into opening malicious attachments or links.

The next part of the question is about what happens after the delivery. It asks if the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at the memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

Looking at the related TTPs provided, they are both under the Persistence tactic. The first is T1053.005, which is Scheduled Task, and the second is T1547.001, Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder. These are both methods attackers use to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

Now, considering the attack sequence: after initial access via a phishing email, the next steps typically involve executing malicious code. PowerShell scripts are often used because they can be executed directly in memory, which helps avoid some detection mechanisms. So, executing a PowerShell script from the internet makes sense as the next step because it allows the attacker to run code without writing it to disk, which can be stealthier.

After executing the script, the attacker would likely want to ensure that the malicious activity continues even after a system reboot. This is where persistence techniques come into play. Using startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks are common methods for persistence. The script might create a shortcut in the startup folder or set up a scheduled task that runs at certain intervals or on startup.

So, putting it all together: the attack starts with a phishing email (Initial Access), then executes a PowerShell script in memory (Execution), and then sets up persistence using startup folders and scheduled tasks (Persistence). This sequence is logical because it follows the typical kill chain phases: Initial Access, Execution, and then Persistence.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes" because the described sequence aligns with common attack patterns using the mentioned TTPs.

The attack sequence described follows a logical progression: initial access via phishing, execution of a PowerShell script in memory, and then establishing persistence through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks. This aligns with common tactics and techniques used by attackers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
