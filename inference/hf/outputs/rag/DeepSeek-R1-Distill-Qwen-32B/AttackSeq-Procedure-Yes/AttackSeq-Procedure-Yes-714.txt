Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after being injected via a malicious macro in Word. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that initial access is achieved by injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro. I know that Sharpshooter is a known downloader, often used in phishing attacks, and it's associated with the TTPs provided. The related TTPs are Execution: T1204.002 (Malicious File) and Execution: T1059.005 (Visual Basic). 

So, the initial access vector here is a malicious macro, which is a common technique. Once the macro runs, it injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the Word process. Sharpshooter's primary function is to download additional payloads. Now, the question is about whether the Rising Sun implant, which is another piece of malware, will then download a second-stage payload.

I remember that in many cyberattacks, especially those involving APTs, the initial payload (like a downloader) is used to fetch more sophisticated tools. The Sharpshooter downloader is often used to deliver other implants. So, if the Rising Sun implant is the next stage, it's plausible that it would download further payloads to carry out more malicious activities.

Looking at the TTPs, T1204.002 involves using malicious files, which fits the scenario of downloading additional malware. T1059.005 relates to using Visual Basic scripts, which are often used in macros and can be part of the execution chain.

Putting this together, the sequence makes sense: macro (T1059.005) leads to Sharpshooter (T1204.002), which then downloads Rising Sun, which in turn might download more payloads. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The scenario involves a malicious macro (T1059.005) leading to the injection of Sharpshooter (T1204.002), which typically downloads additional payloads. Given that Rising Sun is another implant, it's logical that it would download a second-stage payload for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
