Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether Agrius, after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle' which turned into ransomware to destroy data. 

First, I need to understand the context. The question mentions 'IPsec Helper' as a backdoor used for communication over HTTP. This backdoor allows actions like updating relays or downloading files. Then, it asks if Agrius would deploy wipers, specifically 'Apostle', which later became ransomware, to destroy data.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic is Impact with Technique T1485-Data Destruction, and Defense Evasion with T1070.004-File Deletion. 

So, T1485 is about data destruction, which is a part of the Impact tactic. This technique involves actions that cause data loss, which could be done through wipers or ransomware. T1070.004 is about file deletion, which is a method used in defense evasion to remove traces of an attack.

Now, the question is about the sequence of TTPs. The initial step is using a backdoor for communication and file operations. Then, the next step is deploying wipers/ransomware for data destruction. 

I know that in cyberattacks, after establishing a foothold and ensuring persistence, attackers often move to the next phase, which could be lateral movement, data exfiltration, or in this case, data destruction. Wipers and ransomware are both forms of data destruction, so using them would fit under the Impact tactic.

The 'Apostle' wiper turning into ransomware suggests that the malware evolved or was repurposed. Ransomware typically encrypts data and demands payment, but in some cases, it can also destroy data if the ransom isn't paid. So, deploying such malware would align with the T1485 technique.

Additionally, the use of file deletion (T1070.004) could be part of the cleanup process after deploying the wiper or ransomware, to remove logs or traces of the attack, which is a defense evasion tactic.

Putting it all together, the sequence makes sense: using a backdoor to communicate and download tools, then deploying data destruction tools like wipers/ransomware, followed by file deletion to cover tracks. Therefore, it's plausible that Agrius would deploy such tools after the initial backdoor activities.

The sequence of events described aligns with typical cyberattack phases. After establishing a foothold with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, deploying data destruction tools like 'Apostle' fits the Impact tactic (T1485). The evolution of 'Apostle' into ransomware further supports its role in data destruction. Additionally, file deletion (T1070.004) as a cleanup step is consistent with defense evasion. Thus, the scenario is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
