Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this cybersecurity question. Let me start by reading the question carefully. It says that after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance, is it likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. The related TTPs are Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.005-Scan Databases and Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery.

First, I need to understand what each part means. The question is about whether using certain tools during reconnaissance would likely discover outdated systems and medical devices on a network perimeter. The tools mentioned—masscan, Shodan, and Censys—are all network scanning tools. Masscan is a fast port scanner, Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices, and Censys is another tool for mapping the internet. These tools are typically used in the reconnaissance phase to gather information about potential targets.

The related TTPs are Reconnaissance: T1596.005-Scan Databases and Discovery: T1046-Network Service Discovery. T1596.005 refers to scanning databases, which might involve looking for exposed databases or misconfigured services. T1046 is about discovering network services, which includes identifying what services are running on a network, their versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

So, the question is essentially asking if using these scanning tools during reconnaissance would help in discovering outdated systems and medical devices on the network perimeter. The answer choices are yes or no.

I think the answer is yes because tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys are designed to scan and identify services running on networks. They can detect open ports, services, and even specific devices. Outdated systems and medical devices often have known vulnerabilities or specific signatures that these tools can pick up. For example, Shodan can search for specific types of devices, including medical ones, and report their presence on the network. Masscan can quickly scan a large range of IP addresses to find open ports, which could lead to discovering these devices. Censys provides detailed information about internet-connected devices, which would include outdated systems if they're exposed.

Additionally, the related TTPs support this. T1046 is about network service discovery, which is exactly what these tools are doing. They're discovering what services are available on the network, including outdated ones. T1596.005 is about scanning databases, which might not be directly related to medical devices, but it's part of the broader reconnaissance activities that include identifying various services.

So putting it all together, using these tools during reconnaissance would indeed likely discover outdated systems and medical devices as part of network service discovery. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The question asks whether using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance would likely discover outdated systems and medical devices on a medical network perimeter. These tools are designed for network scanning and service discovery, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1046 (Network Service Discovery) and T1596.005 (Scan Databases). These tools can identify open ports, services, and devices, including outdated ones with known vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
