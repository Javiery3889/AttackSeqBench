Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs mentioned are Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory.

First, I need to understand what each part means. FIN13 is a known cyber threat group, often associated with cyber espionage and financial theft. They use various techniques to carry out their attacks. The question is about their tactics, specifically whether they would use native OS binaries for reconnaissance before moving on to credential access via LSASS.

Reconnaissance in cyber attacks usually involves gathering information about the target's network and systems. Using native OS binaries makes sense because they are already present on the system, making it harder to detect since they don't require downloading new tools. Tools like 'netstat', 'tasklist', 'systeminfo' are examples of such binaries that can be used for reconnaissance.

The TTPs mentioned are under the Credential Access tactic, specifically the technique T1003.001, which refers to OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory. This technique involves extracting credentials from the LSASS process, which is a common method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.

So, putting it together, the attack sequence would likely start with reconnaissance to understand the target's environment. This step is crucial before moving on to more damaging activities like credential dumping. Using native binaries for this phase is a stealthy approach, aligning with the tactics of sophisticated groups like FIN13.

I should also consider if there's any reason why they wouldn't do this. Maybe if they had other methods or if using native binaries wasn't effective, but given that it's a common and stealthy method, it's more plausible that they would use it.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes, because the sequence makes sense in the context of their known tactics and the related TTPs.

The question asks whether FIN13 would use native OS binaries for reconnaissance before credential dumping via LSASS. Given that reconnaissance is a standard initial step in cyber attacks and using native binaries is a stealthy method, it aligns with FIN13's tactics. The related TTPs support the use of LSASS memory dumping after gathering information. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
