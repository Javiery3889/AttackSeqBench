Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking if it's probable that malicious JavaScript was inserted into a Korean news portal to redirect users to an exploit landing page, which then exploited a specific Chrome vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720), before attackers used heap spraying to execute shellcode.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence. The scenario involves a few steps:

1. Malicious JavaScript is inserted into a legitimate website (the news portal).
2. This JavaScript redirects victims to an exploit landing page.
3. The landing page exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
4. After exploiting, attackers use heap spraying to gain arbitrary read/write access and execute shellcode.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic is Initial Access with Technique T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) and Execution with Technique T1059.007 (JavaScript).

T1189, Drive-by Compromise, typically involves delivering malware through a compromised website, often using malicious scripts. T1059.007 refers to the use of JavaScript for execution, which aligns with the initial step of using JavaScript to redirect.

So, the attack starts with a drive-by compromise, where the attacker compromises a website (the news portal) and injects JavaScript. This JavaScript then redirects the user to an exploit page. The exploit page uses a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) to gain access. Once the exploit is successful, the attackers might use heap spraying as a technique to execute their payload.

Heap spraying is a method where attackers fill the memory heap with their exploit code, increasing the chance that a buffer overflow will jump to their code. This is often used in conjunction with exploits to gain control over execution flow.

Putting it all together, the sequence makes sense. The initial access is via a drive-by compromise using JavaScript (T1189 and T1059.007). The exploit landing page then uses the vulnerability to execute code, and heap spraying is used to facilitate the execution of the shellcode.

So, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the malicious JavaScript was inserted as described.
</think>

The scenario described aligns with known attack tactics. The initial compromise involves inserting malicious JavaScript (T1059.007) into a legitimate site (T1189), redirecting users to an exploit page that uses a known vulnerability. Heap spraying is a common follow-up technique to execute payloads. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
