Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers likely launched DDoS attacks against those websites based on the information given. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files from the DDoS C2 servers. I know that XOR is a common method for encoding or encrypting data because it's simple and can be done quickly. Using XOR keys means the attackers are trying to hide their configuration files, probably to avoid detection by security systems.

Looking at the related TTPs, there's Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013, which is about encrypted or encoded files. This makes sense because using XOR keys to encode files is a way to evade detection. So, the attackers are using this technique to hide their malicious activities.

The other TTP is Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499, which is Endpoint Denial of Service. This technique involves causing a denial of service on endpoints, which could be part of a larger DDoS campaign. DDoS attacks typically overwhelm a target's resources, causing them to become unavailable.

Now, the question is whether these observations imply that the attackers launched DDoS attacks against specific websites. The fact that they used encoded configuration files suggests they're trying to hide their attack tools or commands. This is a common practice in cyberattacks to avoid detection by security systems.

The two different XOR keys might indicate that they're using different configurations for different parts of their attack or targeting different systems. This could mean they're scaling their attack or targeting multiple sites, which aligns with a DDoS campaign.

The impact tactic here is about causing denial of service, which directly relates to DDoS attacks. So, putting it all together, the use of encoded files to hide their attack mechanisms and the intent to cause denial of service points towards them launching DDoS attacks.

Therefore, it's likely that the attackers did launch DDoS attacks against those websites, leading to the network failure mentioned.

The analysis indicates that the attackers used encoded files to hide their activities and intended to cause a denial of service, aligning with a DDoS attack. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
