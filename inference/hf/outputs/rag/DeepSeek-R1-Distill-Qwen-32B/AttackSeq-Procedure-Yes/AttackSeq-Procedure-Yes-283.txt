Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Dropping Elephant, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails exploiting certain CVEs, would use a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell scripts and then employ encoded blobs for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions initial access via spear-phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352. I know that these CVEs are related to Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, specifically in how they handle certain objects, which can lead to remote code execution. So, the initial access vector is likely through a malicious document attachment in an email.

Next, the question asks if Dropping Elephant would use a UPX packed backdoor. UPX is a common tool for packing executables to make them smaller and harder to analyze. So, using a UPX-packed backdoor makes sense because it's a way to obfuscate the payload, making it harder for antivirus or analysts to detect.

Then, the backdoor is supposed to download PowerShell command line scripts. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in attacks because it's built into Windows and can execute a wide range of commands. The TTPs mentioned include Execution with PowerShell, which aligns with this step. So, using PowerShell scripts is plausible as it's a common technique in many attacks.

After that, the question mentions encoded blobs for defense evasion. Encoded blobs could refer to obfuscating the PowerShell scripts or the commands to avoid detection. Techniques like Base64 encoding or other obfuscation methods are used to make the code harder to read and detect by security tools. This is a common defense evasion tactic, so it makes sense in the sequence.

Looking at the related TTPs, both T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) and T1059.001 (PowerShell) are relevant. The attack sequence described fits well within these tactics and techniques. The use of a backdoor, downloading scripts, and then obfuscation all fit into the Execution and Defense Evasion tactics.

So, putting it all together: initial access via exploit, using a packed backdoor to deliver the payload, downloading and executing PowerShell scripts, and then using encoded blobs to hide the malicious activity. This seems like a logical and common attack sequence, especially for a group like Dropping Elephant, which I believe is known for using such techniques.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, this sequence is plausible.

The attack sequence described aligns with common tactics used by cyber threat actors. The initial access via spear-phishing exploiting specific CVEs is a known method. Using a UPX-packed backdoor to deliver a payload is plausible for evasion. Downloading PowerShell scripts for execution fits the TTPs mentioned, and employing encoded blobs for defense evasion is a typical technique to avoid detection. Thus, the sequence is logical and consistent with the related TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
