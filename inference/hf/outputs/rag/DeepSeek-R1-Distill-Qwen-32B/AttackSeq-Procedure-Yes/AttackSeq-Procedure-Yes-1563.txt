Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol after a supply-chain attack. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access was through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, delivering the Sunburst backdoor. So, the first TTP here is T1195.002, which is about compromising the software supply chain. That makes sense because the attackers infiltrated SolarWinds and used their software updates to distribute the backdoor.

Now, the question is about what happens next. After initial access, the backdoor needs to communicate with its command and control (C2) server. The related TTP here is T1071.001, which involves using web protocols for command and control. Web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS are common because they're allowed through most firewalls and are hard to detect.

So, the Sunburst backdoor, once installed, would likely use a web-based protocol to communicate. This aligns with T1071.001 because it's a technique where attackers use standard web protocols to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems. Since the initial access was via a supply-chain attack, the next logical step is establishing C2 communication, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Given that the related TTPs include both the initial access via supply chain and the use of web protocols for C2, it's highly likely that the backdoor would use such a protocol. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The Sunburst backdoor, after initial access via a supply-chain attack, would likely use web protocols for C2 communication, as indicated by the related TTPs. 

Final Answer: A
