Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware, after gathering system information, is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTP is Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is asking. Derusbi is a type of malware, and it's known for certain behaviors. The question is about its command and control (C2) communication methods. Specifically, it's asking if after gathering system info, it uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscation and sends POST requests to a specific endpoint.

I remember that T1071.001 refers to the use of web protocols for C2. So, the technique involves using standard web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the command and control server. This is common because it blends in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect.

Now, Derusbi's behavior: I think Derusbi is known for using HTTP for C2. It often uses port 443, which is standard for HTTPS, so that makes sense. The question mentions beaconing via port 443, which aligns with using HTTPS, a web protocol.

Obfuscated communication is a way to hide the actual data being sent. Malware often uses this to avoid detection. So, if Derusbi is using HTTP beaconing, it's likely that the communication is obfuscated to prevent analysis.

The specific endpoint mentioned is /photos/photo.asp. I'm not sure if Derusbi specifically uses this endpoint. However, in general, malware can use various endpoints to make their traffic look legitimate. For example, using a path that seems like it's part of a legitimate web application could help avoid suspicion.

Putting it all together: The question is whether Derusbi uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscation and a specific POST request. Since Derusbi is known to use web protocols for C2, and obfuscation is a common tactic, it's plausible. The specific endpoint might vary, but the overall method fits with what's known about Derusbi.

So, considering the related TTP and the behavior of Derusbi, the answer is likely Yes.

The question revolves around whether Derusbi malware employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and specific POST requests to /photos/photo.asp for C2. Derusbi is known to use web protocols (T1071.001) for C2, often via port 443, which aligns with HTTP/HTTPS. Obfuscation is a common tactic to evade detection. While the exact endpoint isn't confirmed, using a legitimate-looking path is plausible. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
