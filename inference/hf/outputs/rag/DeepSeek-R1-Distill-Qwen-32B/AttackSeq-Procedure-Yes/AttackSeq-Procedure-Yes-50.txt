Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the PowerShell script in question is likely to communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the script is evading defenses by operating in memory and using a specific DCOM object, C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880, to execute files without saving them to disk. I know that DCOM is often used in attacks to execute code remotely, which can help attackers avoid detection since they don't write files to the disk, making it harder for traditional antivirus to catch them.

The related TTPs given are Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell. T1059.001 refers to the use of PowerShell for execution, which is a common technique because PowerShell is a powerful tool that can perform a wide range of tasks, including downloading and executing malicious payloads.

Now, the question is whether this script will communicate with C2 servers and download specific payloads. I know that after initial execution, many malware use PowerShell to reach out to their command and control servers. This is a common step in the attack lifecycleâ€”once the initial payload is executed, it often reaches out to the C2 to get further instructions or download additional payloads.

Ursnif is a banking Trojan, and GandCrab is a ransomware. Both are known to use such techniques. For example, Ursnif often uses PowerShell scripts to download additional modules or to exfiltrate data. GandCrab, being ransomware, might use similar methods to download encryption tools or other necessary components.

So, putting it all together: the script is using in-memory execution to avoid detection, which is a common tactic. It's using PowerShell, which is a known method for executing malicious activities. The next logical step after execution is communication with a C2 server to download more payloads, which aligns with how these types of malware operate.

Therefore, it's likely that the script will indeed communicate with C2 servers and download those payloads.

The scenario describes a PowerShell script using in-memory execution via DCOM to evade detection, a common tactic. Given that the script uses PowerShell (T1059.001), it's typical for such scripts to communicate with C2 servers to download additional payloads, as seen with Ursnif and GandCrab. This aligns with the expected behavior of malware in the attack lifecycle.

Final Answer: A: Yes
