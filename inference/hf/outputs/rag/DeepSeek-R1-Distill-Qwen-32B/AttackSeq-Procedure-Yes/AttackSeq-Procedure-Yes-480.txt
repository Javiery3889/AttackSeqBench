Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Trickbot, after connecting to its C2 server and executing its payload, is likely to delete files with specific extensions on removable and network drives. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion.

First, I need to understand what Trickbot does. From what I remember, Trickbot is a malware that's often used in cyberattacks, typically involved in credential theft, banking trojan activities, and sometimes as a downloader for other malware. It's known for its modular structure, which allows it to perform various tasks based on the attacker's needs.

The question is about whether Trickbot would delete specific files on removable and network drives. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion and File Deletion. T1070.004 specifically refers to file deletion as a defense evasion technique. So, the idea here is that attackers might delete files to cover their tracks or remove evidence of their activity.

Now, I need to think about Trickbot's behavior. Trickbot's primary functions include stealing information, establishing persistence, and sometimes deploying additional payloads. I'm not sure if Trickbot itself is known for deleting files as part of its standard operations. It's more about data exfiltration and maintaining access rather than destroying data.

However, the question is about whether it's "likely" that Trickbot would proceed to delete files. If Trickbot is part of a larger attack campaign, perhaps it's used in conjunction with other tools. For example, in some ransomware attacks, Trickbot might be used as a downloader to bring in ransomware, which then deletes or encrypts files. But Trickbot itself, as far as I know, doesn't typically delete files. It's more about stealing and persistence.

Looking at the TTPs, Defense Evasion is a tactic, and file deletion is a technique under that. So, if Trickbot were to use this technique, it would be to avoid detection. But I don't recall Trickbot being associated with file deletion as part of its standard modus operandi. It's more about hiding its presence through other means, like using legitimate processes or encrypted communication.

Therefore, considering Trickbot's known behaviors, it's unlikely that it would delete files on removable and network drives. That kind of activity is more characteristic of ransomware or wiper malware, not Trickbot itself. So, the answer would probably be B: No.

Trickbot is primarily known for its role in credential theft, banking trojan activities, and acting as a downloader for other malware. Its main functions include data exfiltration and establishing persistence rather than deleting files. While the related TTPs mention file deletion as a defense evasion technique, Trickbot itself is not typically associated with such behavior. File deletion is more characteristic of ransomware or wiper malware. Therefore, it is unlikely that Trickbot would delete files on removable and network drives.

Final Answer: B
