Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in question will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a sequence of events. The malware is delivered via 'Thu moi.7z', which contains 'Thumoi.hta'. When executed, this HTA file runs a VB Script. The VB Script then drops a decoy Microsoft Word file. So far, this makes sense because HTA files can execute scripts, and VBScripts are commonly used in such attacks.

Now, the next part is about whether the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file. The VB Script is supposed to drop this '.exe' file into the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension. 

Looking at the related TTPs, we have Execution tactics with two techniques: T1204.002 (Malicious File) and T1059.005 (Visual Basic). T1204.002 involves using malicious files, which could be the '.exe' in this case. T1059.005 refers to the use of Visual Basic scripts, which aligns with the VB Script mentioned.

So, the VB Script is likely used to perform several actions: dropping the decoy file, creating the malicious '.exe', and possibly executing it. Since the VB Script is part of the initial payload, it's common for such scripts to execute additional malicious files. The fact that the '.exe' is being written to %Temp% with a randomized name suggests an attempt to avoid detection, which is a common tactic.

In many malware attack sequences, after dropping a malicious file, the script will execute it. This could be done by creating a new process, perhaps using commands like CreateProcess or by invoking the file directly. Since the VB Script is already executing, it's plausible that it would then launch the '.exe' file as a new process to carry out further malicious activities.

Therefore, considering the TTPs and the typical behavior of such malware, it's likely that the answer is yes.

The malware, delivered via 'Thu moi.7z' and executed through 'Thumoi.hta', uses a VB Script to drop a decoy file and a malicious '.exe'. Given the related TTPs involving malicious file execution and VB Script usage, it's typical for the script to then execute the dropped '.exe' as a new process. 

Final Answer: A
