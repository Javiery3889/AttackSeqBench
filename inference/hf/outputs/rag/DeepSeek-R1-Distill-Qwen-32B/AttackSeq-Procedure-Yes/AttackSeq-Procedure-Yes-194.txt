Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel after being executed through remote code execution. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access was gained by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. That makes sense because T1190 is about exploiting public-facing applications, which is a common initial access vector. So, the attacker used that to get in.

Next, they ran cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor. SparrowDoor is a type of backdoor or malware, I think. Once it's executed, it's likely to establish command and control communication. The question is about whether this communication would be encrypted using HTTPS.

Looking at the related TTPs, the Command and Control tactic includes T1071.001, which is Web Protocols. This technique involves using legitimate web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for C&C. So, attackers often use these because they're common and can blend in with normal traffic, making detection harder.

Now, considering SparrowDoor specifically, I'm not entirely sure about its exact behavior, but many malware use HTTPS for C&C to avoid detection. If SparrowDoor is designed to be stealthy, it would likely use encryption. However, some malware might use HTTP if they don't prioritize stealth or if they're trying to mimic legitimate traffic without encryption.

But given that the question is about whether it's "likely," and considering that using HTTPS is a common practice in TTPs for C&C, I think the answer would lean towards yes. However, I'm a bit uncertain because not all malware use HTTPS. It depends on the specific malware's design.

Wait, but the question is about likelihood. Since the related TTPs mention using web protocols, which includes HTTPS, it's more probable that SparrowDoor would use HTTPS to communicate. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The scenario involves an attacker using T1190 to gain initial access and executing SparrowDoor, which likely uses web protocols for C&C. Given that T1071.001 involves encrypted HTTPS, it's probable SparrowDoor communicates via HTTPS for stealth.

Final Answer: A: Yes
