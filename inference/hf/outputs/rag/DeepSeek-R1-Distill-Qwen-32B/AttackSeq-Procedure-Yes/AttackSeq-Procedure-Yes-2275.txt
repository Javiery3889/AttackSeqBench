Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Regin is likely to use its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files during the collection phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Regin uses Command-and-Control (C&C) modules like C375h and 1Bh. I know that C&C is a tactic used by malware to communicate with attackers, manage compromised systems, and exfiltrate data. So, Regin is definitely using these modules for communication and control.

Now, the question is about whether Regin would leverage its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files as part of gathering operational intelligence for Collection. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: there are two techniques under the Discovery tactic. The first is T1018, which is Remote System Discovery. This technique involves an adversary querying information about systems, networks, and users. The second is T1083, File and Directory Discovery, where the adversary looks for specific files and directories on a compromised system.

The question specifically mentions scanning for deleted files. I'm trying to recall if T1083 includes the ability to find deleted files. From what I remember, T1083 is more about enumerating existing files and directories, not necessarily deleted ones. Deleted files would fall more under data recovery or forensic analysis, which might be a different technique.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Deleted files are typically not accessible through normal file system operations because they've been unlinked. To scan for deleted files, an attacker might need to use more advanced methods, possibly involving raw disk access or forensic tools. I'm not sure if T1083 covers that.

So, if the question is about scanning for deleted files, it might not be directly covered by T1083. Therefore, Regin might not be using its file and directory discovery feature for that purpose. Instead, if it were to scan for deleted files, it might use a different technique, perhaps something related to data recovery or disk analysis, which isn't listed here.

Given that the related TTPs don't include a technique for scanning deleted files, and T1083 is about existing files, the answer might be No. Regin is likely using T1083 for discovering files and directories but not specifically for deleted ones in this context.

The question asks whether Regin would use its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files during the collection phase. The related TTPs include T1083, which pertains to discovering existing files and directories, not deleted ones. Scanning for deleted files typically requires different methods, such as raw disk access, which isn't covered by T1083. Therefore, Regin is unlikely to use this feature for deleted files.

Final Answer: B: No
