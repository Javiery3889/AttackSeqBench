Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the HTA file in this scenario will communicate with the C2 server using webserv-redir.net. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question describes an attack sequence starting with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document. I remember that CVE-2017-11882 is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically in how it handles certain objects, which can lead to remote code execution. So, the attacker uses an RTF file to deliver the exploit.

Once the exploit is successful, the attacker drops an HTA file. HTA stands for HTML Application, which is a file that can execute scripts on a Windows system. So, the HTA file is likely used to run some malicious code on the victim's machine.

Next, the attacker uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to check for installed antivirus software. This makes sense because attackers often check for security software to avoid detection. If antivirus is present, they might alter their tactics or avoid certain actions that could be detected.

After that, the FinalBot backdoor is executed using DLL sideloading for defense evasion. DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, which can help in evading detection because the malicious activity might be disguised as a legitimate process.

Now, the question is whether the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server using webserv-redir.net. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Tactic is Command and Control with Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols, and Tactic Execution with Technique T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.

T1071.001 refers to using web protocols for Command and Control, which is common. Attackers often use HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with their C2 servers because these protocols are allowed by most firewalls and are hard to block. So, if the HTA file is part of the attack, it's plausible that it would use web protocols to communicate.

T1203 is about exploiting client software to execute code, which aligns with the initial exploit via the RTF file.

Putting this together, the attack sequence involves exploiting a vulnerability, dropping a payload (HTA), checking for antivirus, and then executing a backdoor with evasion techniques. The next logical step for the backdoor would be to establish communication with the C2 server. Since the related TTPs mention using web protocols for C2, it's likely that the HTA file would indeed communicate via a domain like webserv-redir.net.

I don't see any reason in the given information that would suggest the HTA wouldn't communicate with the C2. The use of web protocols is a standard method for C2, and the scenario doesn't indicate any measures to prevent that communication, like using a different protocol or not establishing C2 at all.

So, considering all these points, the answer should be Yes.

The attack sequence involves exploiting a vulnerability, dropping an HTA file, checking for antivirus, and executing a backdoor with evasion techniques. The related TTPs indicate the use of web protocols for Command and Control, making it likely that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server via webserv-redir.net.

Final Answer: A
