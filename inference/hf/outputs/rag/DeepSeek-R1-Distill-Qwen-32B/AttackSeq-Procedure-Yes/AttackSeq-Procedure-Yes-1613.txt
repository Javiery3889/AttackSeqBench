Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Lazarus group, after using backdoor malware, would deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Lazarus group is a well-known cyber threat group, often linked to North Korea. They're known for various attacks, including financial heists and ransomware activities. The question mentions they used backdoor malware for communication and executing commands. That makes sense because backdoors are commonly used to maintain access and control over compromised systems.

Now, the question is about whether they would then deploy Hermes ransomware specifically to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backups. I remember that ransomware typically encrypts files and demands a ransom, but some variants also delete backups to prevent recovery. So, if they used Hermes, which I think is a type of ransomware, it's plausible they would target backups.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Defense Evasion with T1070.004 (File Deletion) and Impact with T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery). T1070.004 refers to deleting files to prevent detection or analysis, while T1490 is about making recovery harder by destroying backups. So, if the attack involved deleting backups, it aligns with both TTPs.

Hermes ransomware, as I recall, is known for targeting financial institutions. It's designed to disrupt operations, which fits the scenario of a bank heist. By deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backups, the attackers ensure that the bank can't easily recover their data without paying the ransom, increasing the pressure to comply.

Putting it all together: Using a backdoor to gain access, then deploying ransomware that deletes backups to disrupt recovery efforts. This sequence makes sense because it follows a logical attack flowâ€”gain access, maintain persistence, then deploy the payload to cause maximum disruption. The TTPs support this because they involve both evading detection and impacting system recovery.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, it's likely they deployed Hermes for that purpose.

The Lazarus group, known for using backdoor malware to maintain access, likely deployed Hermes ransomware to delete backups, aligning with the TTPs of file deletion and inhibiting recovery. This disruption fits the attack's goal of increasing pressure on the bank to pay the ransom.

Final Answer: A: Yes
