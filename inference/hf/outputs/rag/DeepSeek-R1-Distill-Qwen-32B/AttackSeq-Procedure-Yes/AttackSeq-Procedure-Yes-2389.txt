Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the TDrop2 malware, after doing some discovery activities, will communicate with its command and control (C2) servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. The related TTPs are T1132.001 (Standard Encoding) and T1132.002 (Non-Standard Encoding) under the Command and Control tactic.

First, I need to understand what each of these TTPs entails. T1132 is about data encoding, which is a technique used by adversaries to obfuscate their communications. The sub-techniques are 001 for standard encoding and 002 for non-standard. Standard encoding would be using common methods like base64, URL encoding, etc., which are widely recognized. Non-standard would involve custom or less common methods, maybe altering the base64 alphabet or using different encoding schemes altogether.

The question mentions that the commands are encrypted and base64-encoded with a custom alphabet. So, encryption is one layer, and then base64 encoding is another. But the key here is the use of a custom base64 alphabet. Normally, base64 uses a standard set of 64 characters, but a custom one would change that, making it non-standard.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1132.002 is Non-Standard Encoding. Since the malware is using a custom base64 alphabet, that falls under non-standard encoding. So, the technique being used here is T1132.002.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that TDrop2 would do this. Well, using non-standard encoding is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection. By altering the base64 alphabet, the malware can make its communications harder to detect by security tools that might be looking for standard base64 patterns. So, it makes sense that TDrop2 would use this method after discovery activities to communicate with its C2 servers.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes, because the use of a custom base64 alphabet aligns with the Non-Standard Encoding technique, which is one of the related TTPs provided.

The TDrop2 malware is likely to use non-standard encoding, as indicated by the custom base64 alphabet, which aligns with T1132.002. This technique helps evade detection, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A
