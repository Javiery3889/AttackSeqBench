Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails is likely to execute VBS macros from an embedded Word document after gaining initial access. The question is asking if this is probable, and the answer choices are just Yes or No. 

First, I need to understand the context. The question mentions that the campaign uses phishing emails with a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Initial Access, Techniques: T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link) and T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment). 

So, T1566.001 is about sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, which in this case is the Word document. T1566.002 is about sending spearphishing emails with links that lead to malicious content. 

The question is specifically about whether VBS macros will be executed. VBS macros are a common method used in phishing attacks where the malicious payload is embedded within a document, often a Word file. When the user opens the document, they might be prompted to enable macros, which then execute the malicious code.

Given that the malicious file is a Word document ('Richard_Johnson.doc'), it's likely that the attackers are using this file to deliver their payload. Since the TTPs include spearphishing attachments, this aligns with the use of a malicious document as the initial access vector. 

VBS macros are a known technique used in such attacks because they can be embedded directly into the document and can execute scripts upon opening. So, if the phishing email includes a malicious attachment, it's plausible that the document contains a VBS macro that will execute once the user enables macros.

Therefore, considering the TTPs and the nature of the attack, it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded document after initial access through the phishing email.

The observed campaign uses spearphishing emails with a malicious Word document, which is a common method for delivering VBS macros. Since the TTPs include spearphishing attachments, it's likely that the document contains a macro that executes upon opening.

Final Answer: A: Yes
