Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives for files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that CosmicDuke is in the discovery phase, searching removable drives for files but skipping certain file types. That makes me think about the TTPs related to data collection. The related TTPs given are T1025, which is about collecting data from removable media, and T1115, which is about clipboard data.

So, the attack sequence is: search removable drives (T1025) → use clipboard stealer (T1115) → exfiltrate via FTP. The question is whether this sequence is likely.

I know that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, T1025 is under the Collection tactic, and T1115 is also under Collection. Both are about gathering information, but from different sources: one from removable media, the other from the clipboard.

Now, considering the attack lifecycle, after the discovery phase, attackers often move to collection. Using a clipboard stealer could be a way to gather additional data that wasn't found on the removable drives. It makes sense because the clipboard can hold sensitive information like credentials or other data that the user might have copied but not saved to a file.

Exfiltration via FTP is a common method, so that part seems plausible. The sequence would be: search for files on removable drives, then use a clipboard stealer to collect more data, and then send it out. This seems logical because attackers want as much data as possible.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't use both methods. They're both under the same tactic, so it's efficient. Plus, using multiple collection techniques increases the chances of gathering useful information.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The sequence involves CosmicDuke using two collection techniques: searching removable drives (T1025) and using a clipboard stealer (T1115) before exfiltration. Both techniques are part of the Collection tactic, making the sequence plausible as attackers often employ multiple methods to gather data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
