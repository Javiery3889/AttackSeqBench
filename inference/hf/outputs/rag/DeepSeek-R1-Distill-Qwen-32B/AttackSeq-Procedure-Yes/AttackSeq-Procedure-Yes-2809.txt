Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and then deleted by the Derusbi malware after obtaining SSH access and using wget to fetch malware samples. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attacker has SSH access and uses wget to get malware samples. That makes sense because SSH access allows them to execute commands remotely, and wget is a common tool for downloading files. So, they're likely downloading some malicious payload.

Now, the question is about whether the Turbo Linux Kernel Module is involved. I know that kernel modules can be used to load malicious code into the kernel, which is a stealthy way to operate because it's at a lower level and harder to detect. The Turbo module specifically might be a rootkit, which is designed to hide the attacker's presence.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: T1070.004-File Deletion and T1014-Rootkit. T1070.004 is about deleting files to remove evidence, which is a common defense evasion tactic. T1014 is about using rootkits to hide activities, which aligns with kernel-level attacks.

So, the sequence would be: download the malware (which includes the kernel module), drop it to disk, load it into the kernel (which would make it a rootkit), and then delete the file to avoid detection. This fits both TTPs mentioned. The malware (Derusbi) would likely do this to maintain persistence and hide its activities.

I don't see any reason why this wouldn't happen. The steps make sense for a sophisticated attack aiming to stay undetected. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The scenario involves an attacker using SSH access to download malware, which includes a kernel module. This module is likely a rootkit (T1014) designed to hide the attack. After loading the module into the kernel, the attacker would delete the file to avoid detection (T1070.004). This sequence aligns with the described TTPs, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A: Yes
