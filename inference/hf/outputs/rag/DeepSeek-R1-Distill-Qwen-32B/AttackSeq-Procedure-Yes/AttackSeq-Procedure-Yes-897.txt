Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether a malicious Office document delivering KerrDown would contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros and then use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture.

First, I'll break down the question. KerrDown is a type of malware, and it's being delivered via malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading. The question is asking if the Office document would have an image telling the user to enable macros, and then use base64 to execute the payload depending on the system architecture.

Looking at the related TTPs, the tactic is Execution, and the technique is T1204.002, which is Malicious File. T1204.002 refers to the use of malicious files, specifically those that exploit legitimate software features, like macros in Office documents. So, this technique involves using files that execute malicious code when opened.

Now, considering how these attacks typically work. Malicious Office documents often use social engineering tactics to trick users into enabling macros. An image instructing the victim to enable macros is a common ploy because it makes the document look legitimate. Once macros are enabled, the embedded malicious code can execute.

The part about using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on system architecture makes sense too. Base64 encoding is a way to encode binary data, which can be used to obfuscate the payload. The malware might check the system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) to deliver the appropriate payload, ensuring compatibility.

So, putting it together: the Office document would likely have an image telling the user to enable macros. Once enabled, the macros execute code that decodes the base64 payload, which is then run based on the system's architecture. This aligns with the TTPs mentioned, as it's a common method for executing malicious payloads through legitimate-looking files.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.
</think>

The question involves determining if a malicious Office document delivering KerrDown would include an image instructing macro enablement and use base64 for payload execution. 

1. **Malicious Office Documents**: These often use social engineering, such as images, to trick users into enabling macros.
2. **Base64 Payload Execution**: This technique is used to obfuscate and deliver payloads tailored to the system architecture.

Given these points, the scenario aligns with known TTPs, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A
