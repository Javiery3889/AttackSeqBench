Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that initial access was gained through phishing emails with a malicious Word document. I know that phishing is a common method for initial access, so that makes sense. The next part is about an encoded PowerShell script retrieved via a VBS macro. I remember that VBS macros are often used in these kinds of attacks because they can execute scripts without raising immediate suspicion.

The question then asks if this script will execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. I need to think about how these malware families typically operate. Ursnif is known for stealing information, and GandCrab is a ransomware. Both are often delivered through malicious scripts.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two: Execution using T1204.002 (Malicious File) and T1059.001 (PowerShell). T1204.002 refers to using malicious files, which fits the Word document and the VBS macro. T1059.001 is about using PowerShell, which is exactly what the question mentionsâ€”the encoded PowerShell script.

So, putting it together: the phishing email delivers a Word document with a VBS macro. The macro runs, which then executes the encoded PowerShell script. PowerShell is a common tool for attackers because it's versatile and can be used to download additional payloads. In this case, the payloads are Ursnif and GandCrab, which are both malware that can be delivered via such scripts.

I don't see any red flags here. The sequence makes sense because each step logically follows the previous one. The VBS macro is a common way to execute scripts, and PowerShell is widely used for executing malicious activities. Therefore, it's very likely that the script would execute and download those payloads.

The scenario involves a phishing email delivering a malicious Word document with a VBS macro, which executes an encoded PowerShell script. This script is then used to download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. The related TTPs support this sequence, as T1204.002 involves malicious files (the Word document and macro), and T1059.001 involves PowerShell execution. Given the logical progression and commonality of these tactics, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
