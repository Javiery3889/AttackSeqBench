Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described in the question is likely based on the related TTPs provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a phishing email that contains a malicious PowerPoint add-in with an auto-open VBA macro. The macro is supposed to execute commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. Then, the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

The related TTPs are Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic. I know that T1059.005 refers to the use of VBScript or VBA for execution, which is exactly what's happening here with the VBA macro.

So, the attack sequence starts with a phishing email, which is a common initial access vector. The malicious document uses a VBA macro, which is a known technique for executing code on a victim's machine. Once the macro runs, it uses 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper. I remember that 'mshta.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool used to run HTML applications, and it's often abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts or download additional payloads.

The dropper would then likely download the actual malware. After that, the malware creates a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' every two hours. This is a persistence mechanism, ensuring that the malware remains active even after a system restart or if the initial process is terminated.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the TTPs, using VBA macros to execute commands via 'mshta.exe' is a common technique. The sequence described aligns with how many malware campaigns operate: initial access via phishing, execution through macros, downloading additional payloads, and establishing persistence.

I don't see any red flags in the sequence that would make it unlikely. It's a typical attack chain. Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

The scenario described follows a common attack chain: initial access via phishing, execution using VBA macros, downloading a dropper with 'mshta.exe', and establishing persistence. This aligns with the related TTPs, making the sequence plausible.

Final Answer: A
