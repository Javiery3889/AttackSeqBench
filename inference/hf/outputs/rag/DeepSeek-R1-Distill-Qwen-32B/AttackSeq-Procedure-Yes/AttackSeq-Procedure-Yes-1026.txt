Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware uses malicious macros for persistence and a backdoor for discovery. The related TTPs are Collection: T1039 (Data from Network Shared Drive) and Discovery: T1083 (File and Directory Discovery). 

So, the attack sequence starts with inserting malicious macros into existing documents. That makes sense because macros can execute code when the document is opened, which is a common persistence method. Then, using a backdoor, the malware can perform discovery activities. The backdoor likely allows the attacker to list interesting files, like Office documents, which is part of the discovery phase.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data. The related TTPs here are about collection from network drives and file discovery. 

T1039 specifically refers to collecting data from network shared drives, which is a part of the Collection tactic. T1083 is about discovering files and directories, which is part of the Discovery tactic. So, if the malware is using a backdoor for discovery, it's likely that it's already using T1083 to find files. But the question is about whether it will go further to collect data from network drives, which would be T1039.

Gamaredon is known for targeting sensitive information, often in the context of espionage. Their tactics usually involve moving laterally and collecting data from various sources, including network drives. So, it's plausible that after initial discovery, they would expand their data collection to include network shared drives.

Putting it all together, the malware's behavior aligns with both T1083 and T1039. The initial discovery phase uses T1083 to find files, and then the collection phase uses T1039 to gather data from network drives. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that they will scan all drives, including network shared ones, for sensitive data.

The malware's behavior aligns with both T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) and T1039 (Data from Network Shared Drive). After using a backdoor for discovery, it's plausible that Gamaredon's malware would proceed to collect data from network shared drives as part of its data collection activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
