Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke captures credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. That makes me think about what kind of tactics and techniques they're using. The related TTPs provided are Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture and Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture, as well as Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging.

So, T1056.003 is about capturing credentials through web portals. That would involve setting up a fake login page, like the Ivanti Connect Secure one mentioned, to trick users into entering their credentials. On the other hand, T1056.001 is keylogging, which is more about capturing keystrokes as the user types, regardless of the application.

The question is asking if CosmicDuke is likely to use the web portal capture method after discovering files. Since the related TTPs include both web portal capture and keylogging under the same T1056, it's possible they use either or both. However, the question specifically mentions a manipulated login page, which points directly to T1056.003.

I should consider whether CosmicDuke has been observed using such techniques. From what I know, CosmicDuke, also known as APT29 or CozyDuke, is known for using credential theft methods. They often use phishing and web-based attacks to capture credentials. So, using a manipulated login page fits their modus operandi.

Additionally, the fact that they're targeting files on hard drives and network drives suggests they're looking for sensitive information, which would include credentials. Capturing credentials via a web portal would help them gain access to more systems and data, which aligns with their goals.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes because the TTPs indicate they use web portal capture, and their tactics align with such an approach.

The analysis indicates that CosmicDuke is likely to use web portal capture techniques, as evidenced by the related TTPs and their known methods. The specific mention of a manipulated login page aligns with T1056.003, and their tactics support credential theft through such means.

Final Answer: A: Yes
