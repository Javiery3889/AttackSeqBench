Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that an obfuscated batch script is used to execute myScript.ps1. Obfuscation is a common technique attackers use to avoid detection, so that makes sense. The batch script is likely trying to hide its true intent.

Now, the main point is about whether the PowerShell script will use Telnet for C2 instead of njRAT. I know that njRAT is a known remote administration tool used by attackers for command and control. Telnet, on the other hand, is a protocol that's been around for a long time but is less secure and often used for remote access, though it's not as common in modern attacks because it's not encrypted and can be easily monitored.

Looking at the related TTPs, the technique mentioned is T1059.001, which is about using PowerShell for execution. This technique often involves using PowerShell scripts to execute malicious commands or download additional payloads. So, the initial execution is via PowerShell, which is a common method.

Now, considering the attack sequence: the batch script executes a PowerShell script. What does that script do? It could do many things, but the question is about the communication method. If the script is designed for C2, it's more likely to use a tool that's effective and less likely to be detected. njRAT is a tool that's been used in various attacks, so it's plausible that the script would use it. Telnet, while possible, is less likely because it's more straightforward and might be easier to detect, especially since it's not encrypted.

Also, attackers often prefer more sophisticated tools for C2 to maintain persistence and avoid detection. njRAT provides more functionality and is designed for such purposes, whereas Telnet is more basic and might not offer the same level of control or stealth.

So, putting it all together, the PowerShell script is more likely to use njRAT for C2 rather than Telnet. Therefore, the answer should be that it's not likely to use Telnet instead of njRAT.

The question revolves around whether a PowerShell script executed via an obfuscated batch script would use Telnet for command and control (C2) instead of njRAT. Given that the related TTP involves using PowerShell for execution, it's more plausible that the script would employ a tool like njRAT, which is designed for C2 and offers better functionality and stealth compared to Telnet. Telnet is less secure and more detectable, making it less likely to be chosen by attackers for such purposes.

Final Answer: B: No
