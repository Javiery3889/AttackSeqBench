Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use the FTP protocol for C2 communication after the Harvester's tool captures screenshots. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Harvester's tool captures and archives screenshots, which falls under the Collection tactic, specifically the T1113 technique for screen capture. That makes sense because screen capture is a common way for attackers to gather information from a compromised system.

Next, the question is about whether the backdoors will use FTP for command and control (C2) communication. The related TTPs include T1071.002, which is about using file transfer protocols for C2. I know that FTP is a common protocol, but I also remember that attackers often prefer more stealthy methods.

I recall that Cobalt Strike Beacon typically uses HTTP or HTTPS for C2 because these are more common and can blend in better with normal traffic. FTP is less common because it's not as encrypted and might raise more flags. Plus, using FTP could be less reliable in environments where it's blocked or monitored.

Backdoor.Graphon, being a custom backdoor, might have more flexibility, but again, using FTP for C2 doesn't seem likely. Attackers usually want to avoid detection, and FTP isn't the best for that. They might use it for data exfiltration, but for ongoing command and control, they'd probably stick to more standard and less suspicious protocols.

So putting it all together, even though FTP is a possible method, it's not the most likely one for these specific tools. They're more likely to use HTTP-based communication to stay under the radar.

The question revolves around whether Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon would use FTP for C2 after capturing screenshots. While FTP is a possible method (T1071.002), attackers typically prefer stealthier protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. Cobalt Strike Beacon, in particular, uses HTTP/HTTPS for blending into normal traffic. Therefore, FTP is less likely for C2 in this scenario.

Final Answer: B: No
