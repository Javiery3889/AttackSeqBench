Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails is likely to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through the phishing emails. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about a cyber campaign that uses phishing emails with a malicious document, 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The main point is whether they'll exploit a specific vulnerability, CVE-2018-13379, in FortiOS devices after initial access.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: the tactics are both under Initial Access. The techniques are T1190, which is Exploit Public-Facing Application, and T1566.001, which is Spearphishing Attachment. So, the campaign is using spearphishing attachments to gain initial access, and then possibly exploiting a public-facing application.

Now, the question is about whether they'll exploit CVE-2018-13379. I need to recall what that vulnerability is about. CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, specifically in the SSL VPN component. It allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to remote code execution. This is a critical vulnerability because it doesn't require authentication, so it's a high-risk issue.

In the context of the attack sequence, the initial access is via phishing emails with a malicious document. Once they've gained initial access, the next step would be to exploit another vulnerability to escalate privileges or move laterally. Since the related TTPs include exploiting public-facing applications, it makes sense that after initial access, they might target a public-facing FortiOS device using this CVE.

So, the attack sequence would be: use spearphishing to get in (T1566.001), then exploit a public-facing application vulnerability (T1190) like CVE-2018-13379. This would allow them to gain more access or control over the network.

Therefore, it's plausible that after initial access via phishing, they would exploit this specific CVE in FortiOS devices. So the answer should be yes.

The campaign uses spearphishing to gain initial access, and then exploits a public-facing application vulnerability, which aligns with exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

Final Answer: A: Yes
