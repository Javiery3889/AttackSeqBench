Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor from the CostaRicto Campaign would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase after establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the question. It's asking if, after establishing the C2 channel, the backdoor would perform process and system information discovery. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Next, I'll examine the related TTPs provided. The tactics and techniques listed are:

1. Command and Control with T1572 - Protocol Tunneling
2. Command and Control with T1071.004 - DNS
3. Discovery with T1057 - Process Discovery

So, the question is about the sequence of TTPs. The attack starts with establishing a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Then, the question is whether the next step would involve process and system information discovery.

I know that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the initial access and command and control phases are often followed by the discovery phase. Once an attacker has a foothold in a network, they typically gather information about the environment to understand their position and plan further actions.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1057 is Process Discovery, which is part of the Discovery tactic. This technique involves an adversary enumerating running processes to gather information about the system. It's a common step after establishing C2 because the attacker needs to know what's running on the system to find sensitive processes or to identify potential targets for lateral movement.

The question mentions "process discovery and system information discovery." While T1057 specifically covers process discovery, system information discovery might involve other techniques like T1082 (System Information Discovery) or T1007 (Account Access Removal). However, since the related TTPs only mention T1057, I'll focus on that.

So, after establishing the C2 channel, the next logical step for the attacker would be to discover what's on the system. This makes sense because they need to understand the environment to carry out further attacks, like lateral movement or data exfiltration.

Therefore, it's likely that the SombRAT backdoor would perform process discovery as part of the Discovery phase after establishing the C2 channel.

The SombRAT backdoor, after establishing a C2 channel using protocol tunneling, would likely proceed to gather information about the system. This aligns with the Discovery phase, where process discovery (T1057) is a common technique to understand the environment. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
