Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed via employee macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the question. It mentions that after reconnaissance activities, which include gathering publicly available information and active discovery, the next step is whether BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts for executing payloads. The method of installation is through employee-enabled macro execution.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: the tactics are Discovery and Execution. The techniques are T1497.002, which is User Activity Based Checks, and T1059.005, which is Visual Basic. 

I know that TTPs stand for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. So, the question is linking these TTPs to the attack sequence. The question is about the likelihood of using Ruby scripts in this context.

BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware, often associated with cyber espionage and attacks, especially in the context of energy sectors. From what I remember, BlackEnergy has been used in attacks that involve spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, often using macros to execute malicious code. 

The technique T1059.005 refers to the use of Visual Basic for execution. Visual Basic is a common language used in macros, especially in Microsoft Office documents. So, if the implant is installed via a macro, it's likely that the initial execution is done using Visual Basic. 

Ruby scripts, on the other hand, are less commonly associated with such attacks, especially in the context of macro-based infections. Typically, after the initial execution via a macro, the payload might be in a different form, like a DLL or an executable, but not necessarily Ruby. 

The question is whether Ruby scripts are used after the implant is installed. Since the related TTPs mention Visual Basic, it suggests that the execution technique is more aligned with VB rather than Ruby. Therefore, using Ruby scripts in this scenario seems less likely.

So, putting it all together: the attack uses macros (Visual Basic) to execute the initial payload, and the related TTPs support that. There's no indication that Ruby is part of the execution process here. Therefore, the answer is likely B: No.
</think>

The question revolves around whether BlackEnergy 3 uses Ruby scripts after being installed via macros. The related TTPs indicate the use of Visual Basic for execution, which aligns with macro-based attacks. Since Ruby isn't mentioned and Visual Basic is, the answer is B: No.

Final Answer: B
