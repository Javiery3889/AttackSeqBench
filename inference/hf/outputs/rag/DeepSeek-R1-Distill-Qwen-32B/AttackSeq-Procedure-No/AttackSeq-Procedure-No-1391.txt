Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to dump LSASS process memory to get credentials before doing reconnaissance using native OS binaries. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that FIN13 is a cyber threat group, often associated with financial crimes, like stealing payment card information. They use various techniques to carry out their attacks. The question is about their sequence of actions: do they dump LSASS memory for credentials before gathering info on the network and host?

Looking at the related TTPs, the tactic mentioned is Credential Access, and the technique is T1003.001, which is LSASS Memory. So, LSASS is a known method for credential dumping. That makes sense because stealing credentials is a common first step in many attacks to gain deeper access.

Now, the question is about the sequence. Typically, in an attack, the initial steps involve gaining access, then moving laterally, and then exfiltrating data. Credential dumping is often done early on because having valid credentials allows attackers to move more freely within the network without being detected.

So, if FIN13 dumps LSASS memory first, they can get the necessary credentials to escalate privileges or move laterally. After that, they might use native OS binaries for reconnaissance to understand the network better, which would help them in further steps like lateral movement or data exfiltration.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do this. Credential access is a foundational step, and using native tools for recon is also a common tactic to avoid detection. So, the sequence makes sense: dump credentials first, then gather info.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The analysis indicates that FIN13 is likely to dump LSASS memory for credentials before conducting reconnaissance. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where credential access precedes further network exploration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
