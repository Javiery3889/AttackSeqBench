Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Carbanak group used LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the network and collect admin credentials before getting the Domain Administrator credentials and compromising more endpoints. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning are techniques used by attackers to capture credentials. These techniques exploit the way Windows machines resolve NetBIOS names. When a machine can't find a name using DNS, it sends out an LLMNR or NBT-NS query, and an attacker can respond to this query, tricking the machine into sending credentials to the attacker's machine. This is often used for credential theft.

SMB Relay is another technique where the attacker takes these stolen credentials and uses them to access other machines on the network. So, if an attacker can get a user's credentials, they can relay those to other SMB services, allowing them to move laterally within the network.

Now, looking at the question, it's asking if Carbanak used these techniques to map the network and collect admin credentials. The answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs mention both Credential Access and Collection tactics with the same technique, T1557.001.

I remember that Carbanak is known for targeting financial institutions and using sophisticated techniques. They often use credential theft and lateral movement. LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay are common in such attacks because they allow attackers to gather credentials and move through the network without needing to exploit vulnerabilities on each machine.

So, the sequence makes sense: first, use LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning to collect credentials, then use SMB relay to move laterally, map the network, and eventually get higher-level credentials like Domain Administrator. This would allow them to compromise more endpoints.

I don't see any reason why Carbanak wouldn't use these techniques. They fit well into their modus operandi of credential theft and lateral movement. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The Carbanak group is known for using credential theft and lateral movement techniques. LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and SMB relay are effective methods for stealing credentials and moving through a network. This sequence aligns with their tactics, making it likely they used these techniques to compromise the network.

Final Answer: A
