Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers likely used heap spraying techniques before inserting malicious JavaScript into a Korean news portal. The question is about whether heap spraying was part of their attack sequence, specifically to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute shellcode.

First, I'll break down the question. The scenario involves a drive-by compromise where attackers injected JavaScript into a news portal. This JavaScript then redirects victims to an exploit landing page that uses a specific CVE in Google Chrome, which is CVE-2019-13720. The question is asking if heap spraying was used before this to get a read/write primitive and execute shellcode.

Looking at the related TTPs, the tactics mentioned are Initial Access with T1189 (Drive-by Compromise) and Execution with T1059.007 (JavaScript). So, the attack starts with a drive-by compromise, which is when an attacker compromises a website to deliver malware to visitors. The execution part is using JavaScript, which is a common technique for running code on the victim's machine.

Now, heap spraying is a technique where attackers fill the memory heap with specific data to increase the chances of a successful exploit, especially in buffer overflow attacks. It's often used to control the memory layout so that when a vulnerability is exploited, the execution flow can be redirected to the attacker's code. Heap spraying is typically associated with exploits that require precise control over memory, like those targeting use-after-free vulnerabilities or other memory corruption issues.

CVE-2019-13720 is a vulnerability in Google Chrome. I should check what kind of vulnerability this is. From what I remember, CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program continues to use a pointer to memory after it has been freed, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly.

Given that, how would an attacker exploit this? They would likely need to trigger the vulnerability, which might involve causing a specific condition where the program accesses already freed memory. To make this reliable, heap spraying could be used to fill the heap with the attacker's shellcode or a pointer to it, increasing the chances that the freed memory is overwritten with the attacker's data.

But wait, in the context of a drive-by compromise using JavaScript, the exploit is delivered via the browser. JavaScript can be used to exploit memory vulnerabilities in the browser. So, the malicious JavaScript would likely contain the exploit code. Heap spraying is a technique that can be implemented within JavaScript to prepare the memory for the exploit.

So, the sequence would be: the attacker compromises the website (drive-by), the victim visits the site, the malicious JavaScript runs, which includes heap spraying to set up the memory, then triggers the CVE-2019-13720 exploit, leading to arbitrary code execution.

But is heap spraying necessary here? Heap spraying is more commonly associated with older exploit techniques, especially in environments where memory addresses are not randomized. With modern browsers having ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), heap spraying might not be as effective because the memory layout is randomized, making it harder to predict where the shellcode will land.

However, in some cases, even with ASLR, heap spraying can still be used to increase the probability of the exploit succeeding by overwriting a large portion of memory with the attacker's code. Alternatively, the exploit might not require heap spraying if it can directly control the execution flow without needing to spray the heap.

Another angle is that the exploit for CVE-2019-13720 might not require heap spraying. Maybe it's a straightforward use-after-free that can be triggered without needing to fill the heap. The exploit could directly manipulate the freed memory to point to the shellcode, which might be embedded in the JavaScript or loaded from another source.

So, considering the related TTPs, the attack uses drive-by compromise and JavaScript execution. Heap spraying is a technique that could be part of the exploit but isn't necessarily required. The question is whether it's "likely" that they used heap spraying.

I think in many modern exploit scenarios, especially in browsers with various security mitigations, heap spraying might not be the go-to method anymore. Instead, attackers might use more sophisticated techniques to bypass security features. However, it's still possible that heap spraying was used to increase the reliability of the exploit, especially if the vulnerability requires precise memory control.

But given that the exploit is delivered via JavaScript, which can directly execute code, maybe the heap spraying isn't necessary because the JavaScript can directly inject the payload. Alternatively, the exploit might use a technique that doesn't require heap spraying, such as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or other methods to bypass DEP and ASLR.

In conclusion, while heap spraying is a possible technique, it's not necessarily the most likely one in this context, especially considering modern browser security measures. Therefore, the answer might be that it's not likely they used heap spraying.

The question revolves around whether heap spraying was likely used in an attack involving a drive-by compromise through a Korean news portal, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome. The analysis considers the related TTPs of drive-by compromise and JavaScript execution.

Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the likelihood of a successful exploit by filling memory with specific data. However, modern browsers like Chrome employ security measures such as ASLR, which randomize memory addresses, reducing the effectiveness of heap spraying. The exploit for CVE-2019-13720, a use-after-free vulnerability, might not require heap spraying, as it could directly manipulate memory without needing to spray the heap. Additionally, JavaScript can directly inject payloads, making heap spraying less necessary.

Given these factors, while heap spraying is possible, it is not the most likely technique used in this scenario, especially with modern security mitigations in place.

Final Answer: B: No
