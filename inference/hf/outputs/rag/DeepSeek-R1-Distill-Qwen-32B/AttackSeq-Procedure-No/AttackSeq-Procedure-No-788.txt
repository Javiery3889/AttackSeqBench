Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Higaisa APT group is likely to compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the question. It's asking if Higaisa would use a two-step approach: first, send spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files (like fake CVs or IELTS results), and then, after that, compromise legitimate browser updates to deliver a backdoor. The answer choices are just Yes or No.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided. The first one is Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link. That makes sense because the question mentions spear-phishing with LNK files, which are often used in such attacks. The second TTP is Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002 - Compromise Software Supply Chain. This technique involves compromising legitimate software updates to distribute malware.

So, the question is about whether Higaisa would use both of these techniques in sequence. I need to think about how APT groups typically operate. Usually, APTs use multiple methods to gain initial access. Spear-phishing is a common first step because it's effective. Once they have a foothold, they might use other methods to maintain access or expand their reach.

But the question is specifically about whether they would compromise legitimate browser updates after the spear-phishing. That would mean they're using two different initial access vectors. I'm not sure if APT groups typically do that. Usually, they might use one method to get in and then use other techniques for persistence or lateral movement, but using two different initial access methods in a sequence seems a bit more involved.

Wait, but the question is about the likelihood. Higaisa is known for using spear-phishing with malicious attachments, so the first part makes sense. The second part is about compromising browser updates. I'm not sure if Higaisa has been specifically linked to supply chain attacks. The TTPs provided include both, but I don't know if Higaisa uses both in the same campaign.

I should consider if it's common for APTs to use both methods. Some groups do use multiple initial access vectors, but it's not the most common approach. They might prefer one method over another depending on the target. So, while it's possible, is it likely?

Also, the question is about delivering a backdoor after the initial spear-phishing. If they already have a backdoor from the LNK files, why would they need to compromise browser updates? Maybe to ensure persistence or to target different systems, but that might be more complex.

I think the answer is probably No because while both TTPs are possible, using them in sequence for the same campaign might not be the most likely approach for Higaisa. They might stick to one method for initial access and then use other techniques for further compromise.
</think>

The question asks whether the Higaisa APT group is likely to use both spear-phishing with malicious LNK files and compromising legitimate browser updates as part of their attack sequence. The analysis considers the likelihood based on the provided TTPs and typical APT behavior.

Higaisa is known for using spear-phishing with malicious attachments, which aligns with the first TTP. However, the second TTP involves supply chain compromise, which is less commonly associated with Higaisa. While APTs may use multiple initial access vectors, it's not typical for them to sequence these methods in the same campaign. The complexity and redundancy of using both methods for the same goal make it less likely.

**Final Answer: B**
