Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after using SparrowDoor for communication. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that SparrowDoor is used to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS and employs multi-byte XOR keys for encryption. That makes sense because SparrowDoor is a known backdoor tool, and using HTTPS with encryption is a common tactic to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about exfiltration. The answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs provided are T1029 (Scheduled Transfer) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). 

T1029 is about scheduling data transfers at regular intervals, which aligns with the "every 10 minutes" part of the question. T1041 refers to exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control, which in this case is the HTTPS channel established by SparrowDoor.

So, considering that SparrowDoor is already set up for C2 using HTTPS, it's logical that exfiltration would occur over this same channel. Using a scheduled transfer method (T1029) would allow the attacker to automate the data exfiltration process, making it more efficient and less likely to arouse suspicion if done at regular intervals.

Therefore, it makes sense that FamousSparrow would use both T1029 and T1041 in this scenario. The scheduled transfer ensures regular data exfiltration, and using the existing C2 channel keeps things stealthy and efficient.

The scenario involves FamousSparrow using SparrowDoor for C2 via HTTPS with encryption. The related TTPs, T1029 and T1041, support the use of scheduled transfers and exfiltration over the C2 channel. This combination aligns with the described attack sequence, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A: Yes
