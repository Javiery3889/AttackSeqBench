Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 is likely to divide files into smaller chunks if they're 0x1000000 bytes or more when exfiltrating data. The question mentions they use crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to their command and control (C&C) server. The answer choices are Yes or No, and the related TTPs are Exfiltration with techniques T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) and T1030 (Data Transfer Size Limits).

First, I need to understand what each of these TTPs entails. T1020, Automated Exfiltration, refers to the use of automated scripts or tools to transfer data without manual intervention. This makes sense because using modules like pr.dll suggests some level of automation in the exfiltration process. APT28 is known for using such tools to efficiently steal data.

Next, T1030, Data Transfer Size Limits, involves attackers breaking down large files into smaller parts to avoid detection. This technique is used to prevent raising alarms, especially in environments where large data transfers are monitored. If the files are too big, they might be flagged, so splitting them makes the transfer less conspicuous.

Now, considering the question: APT28 is exfiltrating data using pr.dll. If the files are 0x1000000 bytes (which is 1MB) or larger, would they split them? Based on T1030, it's a common practice for attackers to do so. Splitting large files helps in evading detection mechanisms that watch for unusually large data transfers. Since APT28 is a sophisticated group targeting political figures and the aerospace industry, they would likely employ such tactics to remain undetected.

So, putting it together, the use of crafted modules (T1020) combined with the need to avoid detection (T1030) suggests that yes, they would divide the files if they exceed 1MB. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The question revolves around whether APT28 would split large files during exfiltration. Given the related TTPs, T1020 indicates automated exfiltration, and T1030 suggests dividing large files to avoid detection. Since APT28 targets sensitive sectors, they would likely use T1030 to split files over 1MB, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A
