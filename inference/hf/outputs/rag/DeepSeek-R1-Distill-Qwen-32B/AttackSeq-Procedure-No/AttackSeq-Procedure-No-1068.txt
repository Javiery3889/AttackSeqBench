Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the data collected by Yellow Garuda using a Telegram 'grabber' tool is likely to be divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to avoid detection. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. 

First, I'll look at the question. Yellow Garuda is collecting data like messages, media, group memberships, and contacts from Telegram accounts. They're using a tool specifically designed to grab this information. The question is about whether this data is then split into fixed-size chunks before being exfiltrated, which is the process of transferring data out of a network, often to a remote location, as part of an attack.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided: the tactics are Exfiltration, and the techniques are T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) and T1030 (Data Transfer Size Limits). 

T1041 refers to exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is a common technique where attackers use a communication channel they control to send data out. T1030 is about controlling the size of data transfers to avoid detection. Attackers might split data into smaller chunks to blend in with normal traffic or to prevent large data transfers from being noticed by network monitoring tools.

So, considering these techniques, it makes sense that an attacker would want to avoid detection when exfiltrating data. If they send large amounts of data all at once, it might trigger alarms or be more easily detected. By dividing the data into fixed-size chunks, they can send it in smaller, less conspicuous transfers. This aligns with T1030, which specifically mentions controlling the size of data transfers to avoid detection.

Additionally, using a C2 channel (T1041) often involves structured communication where data is sent in controlled amounts to maintain stealth. So, combining both techniques, it's plausible that Yellow Garuda would use fixed-size chunks to exfiltrate the data.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes, because dividing data into fixed chunks aligns with known TTPs aimed at evading detection during exfiltration.

The analysis indicates that dividing data into fixed-size chunks is a common tactic to avoid detection, as supported by the related TTPs T1030 and T1041. Therefore, Yellow Garuda is likely to use this method.

Final Answer: A
