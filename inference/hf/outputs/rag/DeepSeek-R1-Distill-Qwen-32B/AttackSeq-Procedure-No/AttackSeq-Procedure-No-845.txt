Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether a malicious Office document delivering KerrDown would use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image instructing the user to enable macros.

First, I need to understand the context. KerrDown is a type of malware, and it's being delivered via malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading. The question is specifically about whether the Office document would use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture and then show an image telling the victim to enable macros.

Looking at the related TTPs, the tactic is Execution, and the technique is T1204.002, which is Malicious File. T1204.002 refers to the use of legitimate software or tools in malicious ways, often involving file-based delivery mechanisms.

Now, I need to think about how these attacks typically work. Malicious Office documents often use macros to execute code. The macros might be obfuscated or encoded to avoid detection. Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data, including malicious payloads, within scripts or documents. So, it's plausible that the payload is encoded in base64 within the macro.

The question mentions that the execution is based on the victim's system architecture. That makes sense because different architectures (like 32-bit vs. 64-bit) might require different payloads. So the macro could check the system architecture and then decode and execute the appropriate payload.

Additionally, the document would likely contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros. This is a common social engineering tactic to trick the user into enabling macros, which then execute the malicious code.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: the Office document is delivered, it contains a macro that uses base64 to encode the payload, the macro checks the system architecture, decodes the appropriate payload, and then executes it. Before doing all that, the document shows an image telling the user to enable macros.

So, considering all this, the answer should be A: Yes, because the scenario described aligns with how such attacks are typically structured using these TTPs.

The scenario described aligns with typical attack patterns where malicious Office documents use base64 encoding for payloads, check system architecture, and employ social engineering to execute malware.
