Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether proxy servers are likely to be used by RIG EK after they've used an encrypted exploit code with a custom RC4 algorithm for their command and control operations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about whether proxy servers would be part of their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. The answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs given are Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy and Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography.

So, I know that RIG EK is an exploit kit, and they're using encrypted channels for C2. The encryption is using a custom RC4, which is a symmetric cryptography method. That's covered by T1573.001. Now, the question is about whether they'd use proxies, which is T1090.

I remember that using proxies in C2 is a common technique to hide the true C2 server's location. Proxies can make it harder to trace the origin of the attack, making infections more difficult to detect and block. So, if RIG EK is already using encryption, adding proxies would add another layer of obfuscation.

Looking at the TTPs, T1090 is about using proxies to avoid detection. Since the question is about making infections harder to detect, it makes sense that they would use proxies. The fact that they're already using encryption doesn't negate the need for proxies; in fact, they often go hand in hand.

So, putting it together, the answer should be Yes because using proxies would help in hiding their infrastructure, making detection harder, which aligns with their goal of maintaining control over infected systems without being caught.

The question involves determining if RIG EK, which uses encrypted exploit code with a custom RC4 algorithm, would employ proxy servers to enhance the stealth of their command and control operations. The related TTPs include the use of proxies (T1090) and symmetric cryptography (T1573.001). 

Proxies are a common tactic to obscure the C2 infrastructure, complementing encryption. Since the goal is to make infections harder to detect, using proxies alongside encryption would provide an additional layer of obfuscation. Therefore, it is likely that proxies are used.

Final Answer: A: Yes
