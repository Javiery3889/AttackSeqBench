Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Black Energy 2 would use the described tactics. The question is about whether Black Energy 2 would mount and bind to /proc/ filepath, enable operations in memory, remove on-disk artifacts, encrypt its payload, and load plugins directly. The answer choices are Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking if Black Energy 2 would perform a specific sequence of TTPs. The related TTPs given are Defense Evasion with techniques T1055.009 (Proc Memory), T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File), and T1027.011 (Fileless Storage). 

So, let's break down each part of the question. Mounting and binding to /proc/ filepathâ€”this sounds like accessing process memory, which is T1055.009. Then, enabling operations in memory suggests fileless execution, which is T1027.011. Removing on-disk artifacts after evading defenses by encrypting the payload is T1027.013. Loading plugins directly onto the machine also relates to in-memory operations.

Black Energy 2 is known for being a sophisticated malware, often used in targeted attacks. From what I remember, it's associated with the Sandworm group and has been used in attacks like the 2015 Ukraine power grid incident. It's known for using fileless techniques to avoid detection, which aligns with T1027.011. Encrypting its payload would help evade antivirus and other defenses, which is T1027.013. Mounting to /proc/ would allow it to interact with process memory, which is part of its defense evasion tactics (T1055.009).

Putting it all together, the sequence described in the question matches the known TTPs of Black Energy 2. So, the answer should be Yes.

The question asks if Black Energy 2 would use specific tactics, which align with known TTPs of the malware. The analysis confirms that each step described corresponds to techniques used by Black Energy 2, such as fileless execution, encryption, and process memory interaction. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
