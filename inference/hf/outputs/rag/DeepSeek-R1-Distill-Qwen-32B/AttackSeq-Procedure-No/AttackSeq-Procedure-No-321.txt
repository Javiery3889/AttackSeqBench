Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about whether an app that uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on an iOS device. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

The related TTPs given are Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols and Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol.

Hmm, so I need to think about how these TTPs relate to the question. Let me break it down.

First, the app is using FTP for uploading files as part of C2. FTP is a file transfer protocol, and it's known for being unencrypted, which is a security concern because data can be intercepted. The related TTP here is T1071.001, which is about using web protocols for C2. Web protocols include things like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. So the app is already using FTP for C2, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

Now, the question is whether after this, the app is likely to send information via HTTP only after performing some routines on the iOS device. So, after the initial upload via FTP, does it then use HTTP for sending data?

The other related TTP is T1048.003, which is about exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols. Exfiltration is the process of stealing data, and this technique specifically mentions using non-C2 protocols that aren't encrypted. So, if the app is using FTP for C2, which is a web protocol, and then maybe using another protocol for exfiltration, perhaps HTTP, which is also a web protocol but might be used differently.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's likely to send via HTTP after performing routines. So, after the initial C2 via FTP, does it then use HTTP for exfiltration?

I think I need to consider the typical attack sequences. Often, attackers use multiple methods to ensure data is exfiltrated. Using FTP for C2 makes sense because it's a common protocol and can be used to send commands or upload files. Then, for exfiltration, they might use another method, perhaps HTTP, which is more common for web traffic and might be less suspicious.

But wait, the TTP T1048.003 is about exfiltration over non-C2 protocols. So, if the app is already using FTP for C2, using HTTP for exfiltration would be a different technique. So, the app might perform some routines on the device, like collecting data, and then send it via HTTP, which is a different protocol than FTP.

So, putting it together: the app uses FTP for C2, then after performing some actions on the device, it exfiltrates data via HTTP. That would align with both TTPs mentioned. The first TTP is about using web protocols for C2, and the second is about exfiltration over non-C2 protocols, which in this case is HTTP.

Therefore, the answer would be Yes, it's likely to send via HTTP after performing routines. So, answer A: Yes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question says "after performing routines on the iOS device." So, the app uploads files via FTP as part of C2, then does some routines, and then sends info via HTTP. That makes sense because after establishing C2 via FTP, the attacker might perform data collection routines and then exfiltrate via HTTP, which is a different method.

Alternatively, maybe the attacker would stick to the same protocol for exfiltration, but the TTPs suggest that they might switch. Since T1048.003 is about using non-C2 protocols for exfiltration, which could be HTTP, it's plausible.

So, I think the answer is A: Yes.
</think>

The question involves determining whether an app using FTP for Command and Control (C2) operations is likely to send gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on an iOS device. The related TTPs are T1071.001 (using web protocols for C2) and T1048.003 (exfiltration over unencrypted non-C2 protocols). 

The app uses FTP for C2, which is a web protocol. After performing routines on the device, it may exfiltrate data via HTTP, another web protocol, as per T1048.003. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where different protocols are used for C2 and exfiltration. 

Final Answer: A
