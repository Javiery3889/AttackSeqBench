Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sednit group, after using a Flash exploit via spear-phishing, would likely make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the Sednit group uses a Flash exploit called "flash_video_x86.swf" delivered through a spear-phishing email. That's their initial access vector. Spear-phishing is a common technique under the Initial Access tactic, specifically T1566. So that makes sense as their starting point.

Now, the question is about what happens next. They've established a foothold on the victim's machine. The next step in an attack is usually privilege escalation. The related TTPs provided include two techniques under Privilege Escalation: T1134.003 (Make and Impersonate Token) and T1134.001 (Token Impersonation/Theft). 

I know that token impersonation is a method attackers use to gain higher privileges. By making or stealing tokens, they can impersonate legitimate users or processes, allowing them to access restricted areas or maintain persistence. 

Sednit, being a sophisticated group, is known for using various techniques to escalate privileges. Using token impersonation would help them gain persistence on the victim's machine, which is a common goal after initial access. It's a stealthy method because it doesn't require exploiting additional vulnerabilities but rather abusing existing system mechanisms.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Given that the related TTPs include token impersonation techniques, it's likely that Sednit would use this method. They've already delivered the exploit, so the next logical step is to escalate privileges, and making/impersonating tokens fits that objective.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be A: Yes.

The Sednit group, after gaining initial access via a Flash exploit in a spear-phishing email, would likely escalate privileges using token impersonation. This technique aligns with their known methods and the provided TTPs, making it a probable next step.

Final Answer: A
