Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sunburst backdoor would use domain fronting for communication with its C2 server after a supply-chain attack. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access was through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, delivering the Sunburst backdoor. So, the initial tactic here is T1195.002, which is Compromise Software Supply Chain. That makes sense because the attackers infiltrated SolarWinds' software update process to distribute their malicious code.

Now, the main question is about the communication method used by the Sunburst backdoor. The options are whether it's likely to use domain fronting. The related TTPs provided include Command and Control with T1071.004 (DNS) and T1090.004 (Domain Fronting). 

I know that domain fronting is a technique where the domain used in the DNS request doesn't match the actual destination. This is often used to hide the true C2 server's domain, making it harder to block or detect. So, if the backdoor uses domain fronting, it would help the attackers maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Looking at the Sunburst backdoor specifically, I remember that it was known for using a technique called "domain fronting" to disguise its C2 communications. The attackers used legitimate domains, like those of cloud services, to make their malicious traffic appear benign. This would fall under T1090.004, which is exactly domain fronting.

So, putting it all together: the initial access was via the supply chain, and the backdoor would likely use domain fronting for C2. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The Sunburst backdoor, after initial access via a supply-chain attack, is likely to use domain fronting to disguise its C2 communications, aligning with the TTP T1090.004.

Final Answer: A: Yes
