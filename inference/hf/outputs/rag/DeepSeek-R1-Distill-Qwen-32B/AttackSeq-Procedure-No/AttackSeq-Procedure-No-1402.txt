Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that FIN13 is a cybercriminal group known for ransomware attacks, specifically using AvosLocker. Their typical modus operandi involves several steps, including initial access, discovery, lateral movement, data collection, and then ransomware deployment.

The question mentions that after using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase, would they use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: Lateral Movement with T1570 (Lateral Tool Transfer) and T1072 (Software Deployment Tools), and Discovery with T1083 (File and Directory Discovery). 

So, during the discovery phase, they're using native tools and malware to gather information. That makes sense because they need to understand the network structure, identify high-value targets, and find the best paths for lateral movement.

Now, for lateral movement, the question is about using PDQ Deploy. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool, which is often used by IT admins to push software across a network. Attackers can abuse such tools because they're already trusted and can move malicious payloads without raising immediate suspicion.

T1072 specifically refers to the use of software deployment tools for lateral movement. Since FIN13 is known to use such techniques, it's plausible they would use PDQ Deploy or similar tools to spread their malware across the network. This would allow them to efficiently move AvosLocker and other tools to different machines without being detected as easily as using more overt methods.

Additionally, after lateral movement, they would collect data from network shares, which aligns with their goal of gathering sensitive information to facilitate fraudulent transactions or to hold data for ransom.

So putting it all together: after discovery, using software deployment tools for lateral movement is a common tactic, and since the related TTPs include T1072, it's likely that FIN13 would do this. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The analysis indicates that FIN13 would likely use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after the discovery phase, as it aligns with their known tactics and the provided TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
