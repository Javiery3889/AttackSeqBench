Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether an adversary would divide files into smaller chunks if they're 0x1000000 bytes or more when collecting data from Microsoft SharePoint Online. The question is about the collection phase, and the related TTPs are T1213.002 (SharePoint) under Collection and T1030 (Data Transfer Size Limits) under Exfiltration.

First, I need to understand what each TTP entails. T1213.002 is about collecting data from SharePoint, which is a common target because it holds a lot of sensitive information. The technique involves accessing and extracting data from SharePoint sites, which could be done through APIs or web interfaces.

T1030, on the other hand, deals with how adversaries handle data transfer size limits. This technique is about breaking down large data into smaller chunks to avoid detection or to bypass size restrictions imposed by certain systems or transfer methods. For example, if a system only allows files under a certain size to be transferred, the adversary might split the data into smaller files to exfiltrate them without being noticed.

The question is asking if, after compressing and encrypting large data chunks, the adversary would divide files that are 0x1000000 bytes (which is 1MB) or more before collecting from SharePoint. So, the key here is whether the size threshold of 1MB would prompt the adversary to split the files.

I know that many systems, including cloud services like SharePoint, have limits on file sizes that can be uploaded or downloaded. If the adversary is trying to exfiltrate data, they might encounter such limits. Therefore, to avoid detection or to ensure successful exfiltration, they might split large files into smaller ones that fit within these limits.

Looking at the answer choices, A says yes, and B says no. Based on T1030, which specifically mentions dividing data to meet size limits, it makes sense that the adversary would do this. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The question revolves around whether an adversary would divide large files (1MB or more) when collecting data from SharePoint Online, considering the TTPs T1213.002 and T1030. T1213.002 involves data collection from SharePoint, while T1030 addresses dividing data to meet transfer size limits. Given that systems often impose size restrictions, splitting large files helps avoid detection and ensures successful exfiltration. Therefore, the adversary is likely to divide the files.

Final Answer: A
