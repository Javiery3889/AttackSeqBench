Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group. The scenario given is that they've already compromised a computer using GreyEnergy mini, which I assume is their initial access vector. Then, they're using Nmap and Mimikatz. I know Nmap is a network scanning tool, so that's probably for discovery. Mimikatz is used for credential dumping, so that's likely part of credential access or collection.

The question is whether they'll use PDQ Deploy next to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018 - Remote System Discovery. This makes sense because Nmap is used for scanning and mapping the network, which is exactly what T1018 is about.

2. Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer. This technique involves moving tools across the network to other systems, which aligns with the idea of deploying tools like AvosLocker.

3. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool, so using it would fall under T1072.

Now, considering the attack sequence: after initial compromise, they use Nmap for discovery (T1018) and Mimikatz for credential collection. The next logical step would be lateral movement to spread the attack. Using PDQ Deploy as a tool for lateral movement would fit under T1570, and since PDQ Deploy is a software deployment tool, it also ties into T1072.

I remember that some APT groups use legitimate tools for malicious purposes. PDQ Deploy is known to be used by attackers for lateral movement because it's a legitimate tool that can be abused to deploy malware across a network. So, using PDQ Deploy would make sense in this context.

Therefore, the sequence would be: Initial Access (GreyEnergy mini) → Discovery (Nmap) → Credential Access (Mimikatz) → Lateral Movement (PDQ Deploy to transfer AvosLocker). This aligns with the related TTPs provided.

So, the answer should be Yes, they will use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.

The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a system with GreyEnergy mini, uses Nmap for network discovery (T1018) and Mimikatz for credential collection. The next step in their attack sequence would logically involve lateral movement to spread the attack. Using PDQ Deploy, a legitimate software deployment tool, aligns with T1072 and T1570, as it allows them to transfer AvosLocker and other tools across the network. This sequence is consistent with their tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
