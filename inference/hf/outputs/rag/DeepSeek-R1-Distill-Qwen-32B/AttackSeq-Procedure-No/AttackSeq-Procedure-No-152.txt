Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase after using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the question. TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance, which is part of the Discovery phase. Now, the question is about whether they would then use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.

Looking at the related TTPs provided: 

1. **Lateral Movement, T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves moving laterally by accessing shared resources over SMB or using admin shares. It's a common method where attackers use credentials to access other machines.

2. **Lateral Movement, T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, like stolen tokens or certificates, to move laterally without needing traditional credentials.

3. **Discovery, T1083 - File and Directory Discovery**: This is about gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with the initial reconnaissance phase.

Now, the question is about whether they would use a SAML token from an AD FS server. SAML tokens are used for authentication in federated environments, so using them would fall under alternative authentication methods. That points to T1550.

But wait, the related TTPs don't include T1550. They only mention T1021.002 and T1083. So, if the related TTPs don't include T1550, does that mean it's less likely? Or is there another way to connect it?

TG1021 is the group using these tools. If they're in the Lateral Movement phase, they might use the techniques they have. Since the related TTPs for Lateral Movement are T1021.002, which is about SMB shares, maybe they're more likely to use that method rather than SAML tokens, especially if the related TTPs don't mention T1550.

Alternatively, if they have compromised an AD FS server, they might have access to SAML tokens, which could be used for lateral movement. But since the related TTPs don't list T1550, maybe the intended answer is that they wouldn't use it because it's not part of the provided TTPs.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's likely, given the related TTPs. Since the related TTPs for Lateral Movement are T1021.002, which is SMB, and not T1550, maybe the answer is No because they're more likely to use SMB shares instead of SAML tokens.

But I'm a bit confused because SAML token abuse is a valid technique, but it's not listed as a related TTP here. So, based on the given TTPs, the answer might be No because they're using SMB/Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement, not SAML tokens.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing whether SAML token abuse is a lateral movement technique, which it is (T1550), but since it's not listed, perhaps the answer is No because the related TTPs don't include it, implying that TG1021 isn't using that method.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the related TTPs for Lateral Movement are T1021.002, so they're likely using SMB shares. Therefore, using a SAML token isn't part of their lateral movement techniques as per the given TTPs, so the answer would be No.
</think>

The question revolves around whether TG1021 would use a SAML token from a compromised AD FS server during the Lateral Movement phase, given their use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance. The related TTPs provided include T1021.002 (SMB/Windows Admin Shares) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) for Lateral Movement and Discovery, respectively. 

SAML token abuse falls under T1550, which is not listed among the related TTPs. Since the provided TTPs for Lateral Movement focus on SMB shares, it's more likely that TG1021 would use this method rather than SAML tokens. Therefore, based on the given TTPs, the answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
