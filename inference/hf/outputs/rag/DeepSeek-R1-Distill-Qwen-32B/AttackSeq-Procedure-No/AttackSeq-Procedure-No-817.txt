Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether WinDealer is likely to use non-standard ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556 for communication with C2 servers before stealing info from SNS apps and encrypting it with AES. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about the likelihood of using non-standard ports in the context of a cyber attack. The answer choices are Yes or No. The related TTPs provided are T1571 (Non-Standard Port) and T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol), both under the Command and Control tactic.

I know that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, T1571 refers to adversaries using ports that aren't commonly associated with standard services. This is a common technique because using non-standard ports can help attackers evade detection since many network monitoring tools might not be watching those ports. It's a way to blend in or avoid being flagged by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

T1095, on the other hand, involves using non-standard or less common protocols at the application layer. This could mean using something like a custom protocol or an unusual method of communication that isn't typically used for command and control. This technique also helps in evading detection because security measures are often set up to monitor standard protocols.

Now, looking at the scenario: WinDealer communicates with C2 servers before stealing information. The ports mentioned are 6999 (UDP) and 55556 (TCP). These are definitely non-standard ports because, for example, common ports like 80, 443, 22, etc., are standard, whereas 6999 and 55556 are not typically used for standard services.

So, considering the TTPs, using non-standard ports (T1571) is a known technique. Attackers often use such ports to avoid detection. Additionally, if they're using a non-standard protocol (T1095), it might complement the use of non-standard ports. However, the question specifically mentions ports, so T1571 is more directly relevant here.

Therefore, it's likely that WinDealer would use these non-standard ports as part of its C2 communication. This aligns with the TTPs provided, making the answer Yes.

The question revolves around whether WinDealer uses non-standard ports for C2 communication, which is a known technique (T1571) to evade detection. The ports mentioned are non-standard, aligning with this tactic. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
