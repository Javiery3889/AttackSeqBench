Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 is likely to enumerate permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase after deploying a password dumper. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that a password dumper (run.exe) was deployed to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS during the Credential Access phase. I know that LSASS is a common target for credential dumping because it holds user credentials in memory. The technique used here is T1003.001, which is part of the Credential Access tactic.

Now, the question is about the next step: whether APT28 would enumerate permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase. The related TTPs include T1069, which is Permission Groups Discovery under the Discovery tactic. 

I remember that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Discovery phase is about an attacker gathering information about the target network. T1069 specifically involves enumerating permissions of groups to understand access levels and privileges. This makes sense because after gaining initial access and credential dumping, attackers often want to know what they can do nextâ€”like moving laterally or accessing sensitive data.

APT28, also known as Sofacy or Fancy Bear, is a well-known APT group. From what I've read, they often use a variety of techniques to move laterally and escalate privileges. Enumerating group permissions would help them identify high-value targets or systems they can access with the credentials they've stolen. This would be a logical next step after credential access because it allows them to map out the environment and plan their next moves effectively.

So, putting it together: after using T1003.001 to dump credentials, the attacker would likely use T1069 to discover permissions, which is part of the Discovery phase. This sequence makes sense because it follows the typical attack lifecycle of gaining access, then exploring the environment, and then moving laterally or escalating privileges.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, APT28 is likely to perform this action.

After deploying a password dumper to access credentials via LSASS (T1003.001), APT28 would likely use T1069 to enumerate group permissions, aiding in their Discovery phase to map the environment and plan further actions.
