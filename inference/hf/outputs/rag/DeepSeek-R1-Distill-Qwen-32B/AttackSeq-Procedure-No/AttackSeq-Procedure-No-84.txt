Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Vyveva will divide files into smaller chunks during the Exfiltration tactic if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. The question mentions that after compressing files using zlib for collection under the Collection tactic, Vyveva might split the files during Exfiltration. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. The related TTPs are Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.002-Archive via Library, and Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits. 

Looking at T1560.002, it's about using libraries to archive files, which makes sense because the question mentions using zlib for compression. Zlib is a common library for compression, so that fits the Collection tactic.

Now, for the Exfiltration part, T1030 deals with data transfer size limits. This technique involves splitting data into smaller chunks to avoid detection, especially if the network has size restrictions or monitoring for large data transfers. So, if Vyveva is using T1030, it would make sense that they split large files into smaller ones before exfiltration.

The question is whether Vyveva will divide files if they're 0x1000000 bytes or more. 0x1000000 in hex is 16,777,216 in decimal, which is about 16MB. That's a significant size, and many organizations monitor for large data transfers. So, to avoid detection, it's likely that Vyveva would split these large files into smaller chunks.

Putting it together, since Vyveva is using T1030, which is about handling data size limits, they would probably split the files during Exfiltration. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

Vyveva is likely to split files into smaller chunks during Exfiltration to avoid detection, as per the T1030 technique, which addresses data transfer size limits. Given that the file size is 16MB or more, dividing them aligns with this tactic to prevent detection.

Final Answer: A
