Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a phishing email that contains a malicious PowerPoint add-in with an auto-open VBA macro. The initial access is gained through this phishing email. Then, the question is asking if the malware will establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' every two hours. Before that, the VBA macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

I need to determine if this sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) is plausible based on the related TTPs provided. The related TTPs are Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task and Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic.

Let me start by understanding each part of the scenario.

1. **Phishing Email with Malicious Document**: This is a common initial access vector. Phishing emails often contain malicious attachments like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files with macros. These macros, when enabled, can execute malicious code.

2. **VBA Macro Execution**: The document has an auto-open VBA macro. VBA macros are a known technique (T1059.005) used by attackers to execute code upon opening the document. This makes sense as the initial execution step.

3. **Using mshta.exe**: The macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper from a Blogspot URL. 'mshta.exe' is a legitimate Windows tool used to run HTML applications. It's often abused by attackers to execute scripts or download malware. This is a common technique for execution (T1059.005) and could be part of the initial execution phase.

4. **Creating a Scheduled Task**: The next step is the creation of a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' every two hours. Scheduled tasks are a common persistence mechanism (T1053.005). The idea is to ensure that the malware runs periodically even after the initial execution, thus maintaining persistence on the system.

Now, considering the sequence: the VBA macro runs, uses mshta.exe to download the dropper, and then sets up a scheduled task to run mshta.exe again at regular intervals. This seems logical because after the initial execution, the attacker would want to ensure that the malware remains active even if the user restarts the system or closes the document.

I should also think about the order of operations. The macro runs first, executes the initial payload, and then sets up persistence. This is a typical attack flowâ€”gain initial access, execute payload, establish persistence.

Looking at the related TTPs, both the scheduled task (persistence) and VBA macros (execution) are mentioned. This aligns with the scenario described. The use of mshta.exe is a known technique in both execution and potentially persistence, as it can be used to run scripts or download additional payloads.

I don't see any red flags in the sequence. It's a plausible attack chain where the initial access is through a macro, execution happens via mshta.exe, and persistence is established with a scheduled task. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The scenario describes a plausible attack sequence where a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint document uses a VBA macro to execute code, download a dropper via mshta.exe, and then establish persistence with a scheduled task. This aligns with known TTPs for initial access, execution, and persistence.

Final Answer: A
