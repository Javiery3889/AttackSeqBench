Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SBDH malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings for network communication with its C&C server. The question is about whether it's likely, given the context of the related TTPs provided.

First, I'll break down the question. The malware uses powerful filters to collect specific data based on criteria like file extension, creation date, and size. Then, the question is whether it will add junk data to encoded strings to prevent easy decoding during communication.

Looking at the related TTPs, there are two mentioned under the Command and Control tactic. The first is T1001.001, which is Junk Data. The second is T1205.002, Socket Filters. 

I know that T1001.001 involves adding irrelevant data to network traffic to make analysis harder. This technique is used to obfuscate the actual data being sent, making it harder for defenders to detect or understand the communication. On the other hand, T1205.002, Socket Filters, refers to the use of filters to control network traffic, perhaps to avoid detection by monitoring tools.

The question is about whether the malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings. Since T1001.001 is specifically about adding junk data, this seems directly relevant. The use of junk data would make the encoded strings more difficult to decode trivially, which aligns with the question's scenario.

The other TTP, Socket Filters, is more about controlling the data sent rather than obfuscating it. While it's related to network communication, it doesn't directly address the addition of junk data. So, the primary technique here is T1001.001.

Therefore, considering the related TTPs, the answer should be that yes, the malware is likely to incorporate junk data to prevent trivial decoding.

The SBDH malware is likely to incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent easy decoding, as this aligns with the T1001.001 technique aimed at obfuscating network communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
