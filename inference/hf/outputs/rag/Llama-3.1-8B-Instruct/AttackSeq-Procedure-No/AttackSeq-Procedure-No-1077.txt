Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the sequence of events is likely to occur after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server via a specific domain. The sequence of events in question involves the execution of PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document and employing obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001 - PowerShell: This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute code.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts, which are often used in macros.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers are using both PowerShell and Visual Basic scripts for execution. The question mentions the execution of PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document, which aligns with the T1059.005 - Visual Basic technique. However, it also mentions employing obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion, which is a common technique used to evade detection.

Considering the use of both PowerShell and Visual Basic scripts, it is likely that the attackers would employ both techniques in their attack sequence. However, the question specifically asks if the campaign would only then execute PowerShell scripts after communicating with the C&C server. This implies a sequential relationship between the communication with the C&C server and the execution of PowerShell scripts.

Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the campaign would only then execute PowerShell scripts after communicating with the C&C server. The use of both PowerShell and Visual Basic scripts suggests a more complex attack sequence, and the question's phrasing implies a direct causal relationship between the C&C communication and the execution of PowerShell scripts, which may not be the case.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that the campaign would employ both PowerShell and Visual Basic scripts, but the question's phrasing suggests a direct causal relationship between the C&C communication and the execution of PowerShell scripts, which may not be the case.

However, since the question asks for a direct answer choice, and given the information provided, the most likely answer is that the campaign would not be limited to only executing PowerShell scripts after communicating with the C&C server.

Final Answer: B
