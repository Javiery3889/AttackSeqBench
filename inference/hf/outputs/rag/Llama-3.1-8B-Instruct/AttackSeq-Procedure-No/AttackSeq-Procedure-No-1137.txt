To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking whether WINDSHIFT APT will use certain tactics (mimicking legit password recovery pages or using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages) before the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001 - Spearphishing via Service
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003 - Spearphishing Link
   - These TTPs indicate that WINDSHIFT APT uses spearphishing via services (e.g., emails) and spearphishing links (e.g., via social media or emails) during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that WINDSHIFT APT has already used social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com during the Reconnaissance phase. This implies that the Reconnaissance phase is already in progress.
   - The question asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use certain tactics before the Reconnaissance phase. However, since the Reconnaissance phase is already in progress, it is unlikely that WINDSHIFT APT will use these tactics before the Reconnaissance phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Reconnaissance phase is already in progress, as indicated by the use of social media platforms and tracking tools.
   - The question asks if WINDSHIFT APT will use certain tactics before the Reconnaissance phase, which is unlikely since the Reconnaissance phase is already ongoing.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is unlikely that WINDSHIFT APT will use these tactics before the Reconnaissance phase, as the Reconnaissance phase is already in progress.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is: **B: No**
