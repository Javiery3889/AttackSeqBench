To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question is asking whether Regin, a known malware, is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase of an attack.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs provided are:
        - T1040-Network Sniffing: This technique involves intercepting and capturing network traffic for collection purposes.
        - T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as its operating system, architecture, and installed software.
        - T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the processes running on the target system.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the question is asking about the discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker is gathering information about the target system.
    - Network sniffing (T1040) is mentioned, which is consistent with the initial step of monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.
    - System Information Discovery (T1082) and Process Discovery (T1057) are also mentioned, which are consistent with gathering information about the target system and its processes.

4.  Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    - Given that Regin is a malware known for its sophisticated capabilities, it is likely to use various techniques to gather information about the target system during the discovery phase.
    - Network sniffing (T1040) is a common initial step for gathering information, and it is consistent with the question's description of monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic.
    - System Information Discovery (T1082) and Process Discovery (T1057) are also consistent with the discovery phase, as they involve gathering information about the target system and its processes.
    - Scanning for deleted files is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it is a plausible step in the discovery phase, as attackers often try to gather as much information as possible about the target system.

5.  Final Answer:
    - Based on the related TTPs and the question's description, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.
    - Therefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: A
