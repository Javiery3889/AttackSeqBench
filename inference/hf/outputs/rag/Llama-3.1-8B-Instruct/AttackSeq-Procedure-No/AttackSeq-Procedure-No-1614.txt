Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether the collected email accounts from Microsoft Outlook MAPI will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1114.001-Local Email Collection: This technique involves collecting email accounts from local email clients, such as Microsoft Outlook.
- T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule: This technique involves creating a rule to forward emails to a different address, which can be used for exfiltration.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the question is asking about the next step after collecting email accounts from Microsoft Outlook MAPI. The T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule technique suggests that the collected email accounts could be used to create a forwarding rule, which could potentially lead to exfiltration. However, the question specifically asks about exfiltration over FTP.

Considering the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be to use the collected email accounts to create a forwarding rule (T1114.003) that forwards the emails to a remote server, but it does not explicitly mention FTP. However, FTP is a common method for exfiltrating data. 

Given the information, the most plausible answer is that the collected email accounts will be used to create a forwarding rule, which could potentially lead to exfiltration, but the question does not explicitly state that it will be over FTP.

Final Answer: B
