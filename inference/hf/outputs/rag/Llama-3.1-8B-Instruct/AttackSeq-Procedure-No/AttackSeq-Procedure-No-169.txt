Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of activities conducted by SkinnyBoy, which involves discovery and exfiltration. The question asks whether SkinnyBoy is likely to send the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They indicate that SkinnyBoy is conducting discovery activities, specifically:

1. T1082-System Information Discovery: This involves gathering system information, which aligns with the initial discovery activities described in the question.
2. T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This involves enumerating files and directories, which is also mentioned in the question.
3. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is relevant to the question's mention of sending collected information to the C2 server.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the question describes a sequence of discovery and exfiltration activities. The question asks whether SkinnyBoy sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

Considering the TTPs, it is likely that SkinnyBoy would exfiltrate the collected information to the C2 server before encoding it. The encoding step is more likely to be a part of the data collection process, rather than a step that occurs after exfiltration.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SkinnyBoy sends the collected information to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request before automating the collection of data using the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding.

Final Answer: A
