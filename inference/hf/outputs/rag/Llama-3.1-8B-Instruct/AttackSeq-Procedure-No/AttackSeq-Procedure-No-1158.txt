Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. The goal of these phishing messages is to claim copyright violations or offer verified badges. The question asks if it's likely that the attackers will target various collaboration tools to hunt for exposed credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They indicate that the attackers are likely to use chat messages (T1552.008) to deliver phishing messages. Additionally, they may use Confluence (T1213.001) and messaging applications (T1213.005) for collection purposes. These TTPs suggest that the attackers are interested in collecting information from collaboration tools.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of actions for the attackers would be to use chat messages to deliver phishing messages, and then use the collected information to target collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, JIRA, or Confluence to hunt for exposed credentials. This sequence aligns with the TTPs provided.
