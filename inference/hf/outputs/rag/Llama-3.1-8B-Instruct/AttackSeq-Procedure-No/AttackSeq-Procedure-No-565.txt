To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the Question**
The question asks whether it's likely that attackers would park domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

**Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs**
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains (parking domains for future use)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (using a compromised software update as the initial access vector)
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains (registering domains for future use)

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that both T1584.001-Domains and T1583.001-Domains are related to domain registration or parking for future use. However, T1584.001-Domains specifically mentions parking domains, which implies a more immediate or short-term use, whereas T1583.001-Domains mentions registering domains, which could be for both short-term and long-term use.

Given that the question asks about parking domains for future use, it's more likely that the attackers would register domains (T1583.001-Domains) initially and then park them (T1584.001-Domains) for future use. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events after using a compromised software update as the initial access vector.

Considering the context of the question, it's more plausible that the attackers would first use the compromised software update (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise) as their initial access vector and then register domains (T1583.001-Domains) for future use, which could include parking them (T1584.001-Domains) later on.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Initial Access: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (using a compromised software update)
2. Resource Development: T1583.001-Domains (registering domains for future use)

Therefore, it is likely that the attackers would register domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts to acquire infrastructure only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

**Final Answer: A**
