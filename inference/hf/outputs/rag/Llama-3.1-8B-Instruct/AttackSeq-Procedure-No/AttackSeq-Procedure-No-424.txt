Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This suggests that the attacker has successfully tricked a user into opening a malicious attachment, which is a common tactic in phishing attacks.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to Initial Access, specifically T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment. This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment, which is consistent with the scenario described in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the initial access gained through a phishing email with a malicious Word document, the next logical steps in the attack sequence would involve the attacker attempting to escalate their privileges and gather more information about the system. 

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the attacker using a COM object to execute queries to gather system information (T1082 - System Information Discovery). This would allow the attacker to gather valuable information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and network configuration.

The next step would be for the attacker to use this information to download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, which are both known to be delivered through malicious documents and attachments. This would involve the use of T1204.002 - User Execution (User Assisted) to execute the downloaded payloads.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment (initial access)
2. T1082 - System Information Discovery (gathering system information)
3. T1204.002 - User Execution (User Assisted) (downloading payloads)

Final Answer: A
