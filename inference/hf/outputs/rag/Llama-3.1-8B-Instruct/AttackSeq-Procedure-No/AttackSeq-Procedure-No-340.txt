To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the Nemesis bootkit, after achieving persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), will likely evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.012 - File/Path Exclusions: This technique involves excluding files or directories from being scanned by antivirus software or other security tools.
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003 - Bootkit: This technique involves using a bootkit to infect a system, which is exactly what the Nemesis bootkit does.
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1542.003 - Bootkit: This technique is related to the previous one and also involves using a bootkit for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's VBR (T1542.003 - Bootkit), it is likely that the malware will attempt to evade detection.
   - The technique of placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning (T1564.012 - File/Path Exclusions) is a common method for evading detection.
   - Since the bootkit has already achieved persistence, it is plausible that it would use additional techniques to evade detection, such as excluding files from scanning.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's VBR (T1542.003 - Bootkit).
   - To maintain its presence and avoid being detected, the malware would likely use additional techniques to evade detection.
   - Placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning (T1564.012 - File/Path Exclusions) is a plausible method for the malware to evade detection.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
