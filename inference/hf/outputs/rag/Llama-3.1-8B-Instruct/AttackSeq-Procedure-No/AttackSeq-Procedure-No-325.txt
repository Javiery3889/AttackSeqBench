Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving an XAgent app on iOS 7 devices. The sequence includes process discovery and exfiltration of the gathered information via HTTP to a C2 server. The question asks whether the app will execute in the background after sending the gathered information.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This TTP involves the automated exfiltration of data from a system. In this case, it's related to sending the gathered information via HTTP to the C2 server.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This TTP involves the discovery of system and application information, such as processes running on the system. In this case, it's related to the XAgent app collecting a list of processes for discovery.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of actions described in the question involves process discovery (T1057) followed by exfiltration (T1020) of the gathered information. The question asks whether the app will execute in the background after sending the gathered information. This implies that the exfiltration step is likely to occur before the app executes in the background.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the app will send the gathered information via HTTP to the C2 server before executing in the background. This aligns with the order of T1057 (Process Discovery) followed by T1020 (Automated Exfiltration).

Final Answer: B
