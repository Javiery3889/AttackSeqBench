To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the SombRAT malware, specifically mentioning process injection and deobfuscation techniques to decode information related to the backdoor.
    - It then asks whether the malware will archive collected data using a custom storage file format before employing its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs provided are related to Defense Evasion, specifically the technique of deobfuscating/decoding files or information (T1140).
    - This technique is used to evade detection by making it difficult for security software to identify malicious code or data.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - The question describes the use of process injection and deobfuscation techniques, which are both forms of defense evasion.
    - The use of defense evasion techniques typically indicates that the attacker is trying to avoid detection and maintain persistence on the system.
    - Employing process discovery and system time discovery capabilities would likely be a part of the attacker's reconnaissance phase, where they gather information about the system to further their goals.
    - Archiving collected data using a custom storage file format would be a way to store the data for later use, which could be part of the attacker's data collection phase.

Considering these points, it is plausible that the SombRAT malware would archive collected data using a custom storage file format before employing its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities, as this would allow the attacker to store the data for later use and maintain persistence on the system.

Final Answer: A
