Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving an app that uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations. It then asks if the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP involves using web protocols for C2 operations, which could involve sending or receiving data over HTTP or HTTPS.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This TTP involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol that is not encrypted, which could involve protocols like FTP.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the TTPs, the app is using FTP for C2 operations and potentially exfiltrating data over an unencrypted protocol. However, the question asks if the app sends the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device. 

Considering the TTPs, it is more likely that the app would use a protocol like FTP for exfiltration (T1048.003) rather than HTTP, as FTP is specifically mentioned in the TTP. However, the question asks if the app sends the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. 

Given the context, it is plausible that the app could switch to using HTTP for sending the gathered information after performing routines on the iOS device, as it would be a different step in the attack sequence. 

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The app uses FTP for C2 operations (T1071.001).
2. The app exfiltrates data over an unencrypted protocol (T1048.003).
3. After performing routines on the iOS device, the app sends the gathered information via HTTP.

Final Answer: A
