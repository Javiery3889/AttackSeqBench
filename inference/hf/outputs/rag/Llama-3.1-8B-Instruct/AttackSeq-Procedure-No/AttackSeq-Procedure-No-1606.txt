Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving initial access through malicious LNK files, a convoluted infection chain, and the deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting. The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056-Input Capture

These TTPs are related to credential access and collection techniques, specifically focusing on API hooking and input capture. API hooking (T1056.004) involves manipulating the operating system's API calls to intercept sensitive information, while input capture (T1056) involves capturing user input, such as keyboard or mouse movements.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the deployment of njRAT for credential harvesting suggests that the attacker is interested in collecting sensitive information, including credentials. API hooking (T1056.004) and input capture (T1056) are both relevant techniques for achieving this goal.

Considering the provided answer choices, both A and B are related to the TTPs provided. However, the question specifically asks whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT. The TTPs related to input capture (T1056) specifically mention capturing mouse movements, which aligns with the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to capturing mouse movements before deploying njRAT for credential harvesting.

Final Answer: B
