Analyzing the Question:
The question describes a scenario where APT10 initially gains access to a victim's network through spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links. The question asks whether APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement between MSPs and other victims before conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network.

Analyzing the Related TTPs:
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This TTP is related to moving laterally within a network using spearphishing.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This TTP is related to gaining initial access to a network through phishing.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP is a specific type of phishing that uses malicious attachments to gain initial access.

Comparing and Evaluating:
Based on the related TTPs, APT10 initially gains access through spear phishing (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) and then likely uses internal spearphishing (T1534-Internal Spearphishing) for lateral movement. The question asks if APT10 will leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement before conducting internal reconnaissance. 

Given the TTPs, APT10's behavior is consistent with using spearphishing for initial access and internal spearphishing for lateral movement. However, the question specifically asks about leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement. 

Considering the TTPs, there is no direct indication that APT10 uses shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement. Instead, the TTPs suggest APT10 uses spearphishing for both initial access and lateral movement. 

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT10 will use spearphishing for initial access and internal spearphishing for lateral movement, without leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.

Final Answer: B
