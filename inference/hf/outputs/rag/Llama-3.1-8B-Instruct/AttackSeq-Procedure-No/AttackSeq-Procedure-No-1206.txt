Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether the Sunburst backdoor, after gaining initial access through a supply-chain attack, will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic when communicating with its C2 server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS - This TTP is related to using DNS for C2 communication, but it's not specific to domain fronting.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain - This TTP is related to the initial access method used in the question, which is a supply-chain attack.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting - This TTP is directly related to the question, as it involves using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers likely used domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic when communicating with their C2 server. This is because domain fronting is a technique used for command and control communication, and it's a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers compromised SolarWinds through a supply-chain attack (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).
2. They delivered the Sunburst backdoor through this initial access method.
3. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the attackers would likely use a command and control technique to communicate with their C2 server.
4. Domain fronting (T1090.004) is a common technique used for C2 communication, making it a likely choice for the attackers.

Final Answer: A
