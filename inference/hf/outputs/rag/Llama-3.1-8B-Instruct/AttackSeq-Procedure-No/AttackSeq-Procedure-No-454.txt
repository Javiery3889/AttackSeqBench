To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether APT-TOCS (a threat actor) is likely to use removable media for command and control operations after exhibiting lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media
   - These TTPs indicate that the threat actor is using removable media for both lateral movement and command and control operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the threat actor has already exhibited lateral movement through network projection within the internal network, it is likely that they will use the same method for command and control operations.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the threat actor uses removable media for both lateral movement (T1091) and command and control (T1092), indicating a consistent pattern of behavior.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The threat actor has already demonstrated the use of removable media for lateral movement (T1091).
   - Given the consistency in their tactics, it is likely that they will use removable media for command and control operations as well (T1092).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor will use removable media for command and control operations.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that APT-TOCS is likely to communicate using removable media for command and control operations.

Final Answer: A
