Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file, which is likely to be MSIL/Crimson malware. The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API: This technique involves the use of native API calls to execute code. This could be relevant to the execution of native Windows functions.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32: This technique involves using the Rundll32 executable to execute malicious code. This could be a method used by the malware to execute its payload.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code. This is relevant to the initial access achieved through the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will use native Windows functions to execute its code. The use of native API calls (T1106) and exploitation of client execution (T1203) suggests that the malware will use Windows functions to execute its payload. The use of Rundll32 (T1218.011) could also be a method used by the malware to execute its payload.

Considering the sequence of events, it is plausible that the malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. This is because the malware needs to gather information about the system and its environment before it can establish a connection to its command and control server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware gains initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158.
2. The malware drops an embedded downloader file, which is likely to be MSIL/Crimson.
3. The malware uses native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo to gather information about the system and its environment.
4. The malware uses Rundll32 or native API calls to execute its payload.
5. The malware establishes command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

Final Answer: A
