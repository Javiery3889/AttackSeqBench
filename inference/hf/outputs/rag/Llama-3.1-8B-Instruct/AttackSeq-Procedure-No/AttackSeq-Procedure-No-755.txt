To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the Rising Sun implant, after communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, likely performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery
     - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
   - These TTPs are related to discovery and exfiltration tactics, indicating the adversary's intent to gather information and potentially exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the Rising Sun implant communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, which suggests a command and control (C2) channel is established.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the adversary is likely gathering information (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery) and potentially exfiltrating data (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
   - Given that the Rising Sun implant is communicating with control servers, it is plausible that it would perform initial reconnaissance to gather information about the system and network before exfiltrating data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   1. The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests, indicating a C2 channel is established.
   2. Given the C2 channel, it is likely that the implant will perform initial reconnaissance to gather information about the system and network.
   3. The related TTPs (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery) support this reasoning, indicating the adversary's intent to gather information.
   4. Therefore, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
