Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where an attacker gains initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious attachment, specifically the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This TTP involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. However, this TTP is not directly related to the scenario described in the question, as the initial access is gained through phishing emails.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. This TTP is directly related to the scenario described in the question, as the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious attachment.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious attachment, it is unlikely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 is a separate step that would require additional TTPs, such as T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which is not the initial step in this scenario.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious attachment, which aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
2. The exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices would require a separate step, such as exploiting a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
3. Since the initial access is gained through phishing emails, it is unlikely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

Final Answer: B
