Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques where recipients are initially presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report, and then receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery. The question asks if it is likely that they will receive these spear phishing emails only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code on a client-side system.
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of events described in the question involves exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-8750) to deliver QuasarRAT, which is a type of malware. The question asks if the spear phishing emails are sent only after the recipient has been infected with QuasarRAT.

Considering the TTPs, it is likely that the spear phishing emails are sent before the recipient is infected with QuasarRAT, as the emails contain links to RTF documents exploiting the vulnerability to deliver the malware. This sequence aligns with the Initial Access tactic, where the goal is to gain access to the system, and the Execution tactic, where the malware is executed on the system.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the spear phishing emails are sent before the recipient is infected with QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: B
