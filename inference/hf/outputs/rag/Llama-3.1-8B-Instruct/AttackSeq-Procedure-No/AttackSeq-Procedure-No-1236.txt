To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 is likely to employ a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain initial access to a system. The question asks if APT28 is likely to send phishing emails containing malicious links and then use crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1566-Phishing: This is a broad technique that involves using phishing to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This is a specific technique that involves sending phishing emails with malicious links to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
   - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This is another specific technique that involves sending phishing emails with malicious attachments (e.g., Word and Excel documents) to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28 first sends phishing emails containing malicious links (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) and then employs crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) for gaining initial access.
   - The related TTPs provided in the question match the sequence described in the question.

Based on the analysis, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is the one that confirms APT28 is likely to employ the described sequence of TTPs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- APT28 is likely to use the initial scan to identify vulnerable systems and then use bots to report back to a central server.
- The next step would be to use phishing emails containing malicious links (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
- After that, APT28 would employ crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
