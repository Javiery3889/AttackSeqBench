To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks whether threat actors will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms after escalating privileges to gain administrative control over the target network. This implies a sequence of actions: first, acquiring valid credentials, then escalating privileges, and finally, attempting to bypass detection mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts
   - These TTPs are related to acquiring valid accounts, which is a precursor to privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions after acquiring valid credentials. The related TTPs focus on acquiring valid accounts, which is the first step in the sequence.
   - The question then asks about the next step: attempting to bypass detection mechanisms after escalating privileges. This implies that the threat actors have already acquired valid credentials and escalated their privileges.
   - Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, attempting to bypass detection mechanisms is typically a step that occurs after gaining access and escalating privileges, as it is a way to maintain access and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions after acquiring valid credentials.
   - The related TTPs focus on acquiring valid accounts, which is the first step in the sequence.
   - The question then asks about the next step: attempting to bypass detection mechanisms after escalating privileges.
   - Based on the MITRE ATTCK framework, attempting to bypass detection mechanisms is a step that occurs after gaining access and escalating privileges.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is that threat actors will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms after escalating privileges to gain administrative control over the target network.

Final Answer: A
