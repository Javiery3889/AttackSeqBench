To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the Question**
The question is asking whether, after the Shamoon malware overwrites the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic, it is likely that the malware will execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution.

**Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs**
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1542.003-Bootkit: This indicates that the malware is using a bootkit to evade detection by overwriting the VBR.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This indicates that the malware is using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the system.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This indicates that the malware is using scheduled tasks to execute itself.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the malware is using a bootkit to evade detection and is also using scheduled tasks for persistence and execution. This suggests that the malware is likely to use scheduled tasks to execute itself after it has taken control of the system.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**
Given the information above, it is likely that the malware will execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution. This is because the malware is already using scheduled tasks for persistence and execution, and the bootkit technique is used for Defense Evasion, which would allow the malware to take control of the system.

Final Answer: A
