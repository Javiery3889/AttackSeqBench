Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker to deliver a malicious payload, specifically KerrDown, to targets. The sequence involves using malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading. The question asks whether it is likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are T1204.002 - Malicious File. This technique involves using a malicious file to execute the attack. However, this TTP does not provide specific information about the use of base64 blobs or the sequence of events described in the question.

Given the lack of specific information in the related TTPs, we must rely on general knowledge of the attack sequence described in the question. Typically, in a DLL side-loading attack, the malicious payload is executed directly after the DLL is loaded, without the need for base64 decoding. The use of base64 blobs is more commonly associated with the execution of payloads that require decoding before execution.

Considering the sequence of events described in the question, it is unlikely that the Office document would use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. This is because the malicious payload is already being executed via DLL side-loading, which does not typically involve base64 decoding.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a DLL side-loading attack, which does not typically involve base64 decoding.
2. The use of base64 blobs is more commonly associated with the execution of payloads that require decoding before execution.
3. The sequence of events described in the question does not suggest a need for base64 decoding.

Final Answer: B
