Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1). The question asks whether the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are related to Execution, specifically using PowerShell (T1059.001). This indicates that the attack involves using PowerShell to execute malicious code. However, there is no direct information about the communication method (Telnet or njRAT) in the related TTPs.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the information provided, we can infer that the attack involves using PowerShell to execute a script. However, there is no direct information about the communication method. To determine the likelihood of using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT, we need to consider the context of the question.

Since the question asks about a specific scenario where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script, it is likely that the attacker is trying to establish a command and control channel. However, the question does not provide any information about the specific communication method used by the PowerShell script.

Considering the answer choices, we can evaluate the likelihood of each option:

A: Yes - This option suggests that the PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control. However, there is no information in the related TTPs that suggests Telnet is being used.

B: No - This option suggests that the PowerShell script will not lead to communication using Telnet for command and control. This is a more plausible option, as the related TTPs only mention PowerShell execution and do not provide any information about the communication method.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question describes a scenario where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves using PowerShell to execute malicious code.
3. There is no direct information about the communication method (Telnet or njRAT) in the related TTPs.
4. Considering the context of the question, it is likely that the attacker is trying to establish a command and control channel.
5. However, the question does not provide any information about the specific communication method used by the PowerShell script.
6. Based on the information provided, option B is a more plausible answer, as it suggests that the PowerShell script will not lead to communication using Telnet for command and control.

Final Answer: B
