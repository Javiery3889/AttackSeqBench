Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by adversaries. It mentions the Resource Development phase, where adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address. Then, it asks if it is likely that they would use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to gather information about the target network.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique involves hiding the adversary's infrastructure to avoid detection.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery: This technique involves discovering container and resource information to gather intelligence.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the adversaries are likely to use techniques that involve scanning and discovery to gather information about the target network. The question mentions the use of functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase, which is consistent with the Tactic: Reconnaissance and Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase, the adversaries would then use functions like DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase.
2. This information is likely used to gather more intelligence about the target network.
3. During the Reconnaissance phase, adversaries would use techniques like T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks to scan entire netblocks.
4. Functions like DOCKERGEDDON would be used to detect compromised Docker APIs, which is consistent with the Tactic: Discovery and Technique: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery.

Final Answer: A
