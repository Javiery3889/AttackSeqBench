Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions, decoding JavaScript payloads, and dropping a file into the system's temporary directory. It then asks if a JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL before a webpage reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1027.006-HTML Smuggling: This technique involves manipulating HTML content to evade detection by security controls. It's related to the use of iframes and HTML content manipulation.
- T1059.007-JavaScript: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute code on a system. It's related to the use of JavaScript payloads and execution.
- T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) scripts to execute code on a system. It's related to the use of VBA-Macro functions.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the use of VBA-Macro functions and JavaScript payloads, it's clear that the attack is focused on executing code on the system. The use of HTML Smuggling (T1027.006) is less directly related to the execution of code, but it could be used to manipulate the webpage to reveal the source code of the webpage, which might contain the URL of the file to be downloaded.

Considering the sequence of actions, it's plausible that the JavaScript downloader would drop a file from a URL before the webpage reveals its source code. This would allow the attacker to execute the downloaded file before the webpage is fully loaded and the source code is visible.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker uses obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads.
2. The decoded JavaScript payloads are dropped into the system's temporary directory.
3. The JavaScript downloader is executed, which downloads a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL.
4. The webpage 'surprise.php' is loaded, which contains an iframe that reveals its source code.
5. The source code of the webpage shows visitor tracking information.

Final Answer: A
