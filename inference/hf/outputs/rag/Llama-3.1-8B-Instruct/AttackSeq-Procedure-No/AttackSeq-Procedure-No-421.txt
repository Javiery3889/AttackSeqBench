To answer this question, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question is asking whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This implies that the question is inquiring about the sequence of events in the attack.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link
2. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

These TTPs indicate that the attack involves spearphishing, which is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or groups with tailored messages. The two techniques suggest that the attackers are using either a link or an attachment to deliver the malicious payload.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the attack involves spearphishing, which is a common technique used to gain initial access. The question mentions that the malicious payload is embedded in a Microsoft Word document, which is consistent with the T1566.001 technique (Spearphishing Attachment). However, the question also mentions that the attack will execute VBS macros, which is a specific action that is typically taken after the initial access has been gained.

Based on this information, it is unlikely that the attack will execute VBS macros only before gaining initial access. The execution of VBS macros is a subsequent step that occurs after the initial access has been gained, typically through the delivery of the malicious payload (in this case, the Microsoft Word document).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attack involves spearphishing, which is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or groups.
2. The attack uses a malicious attachment (T1566.001) to deliver the payload, which is a Microsoft Word document.
3. The payload is embedded in the Microsoft Word document, which is consistent with the T1566.001 technique.
4. The execution of VBS macros is a subsequent step that occurs after the initial access has been gained.

**Final Answer: B**
