Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where attackers used single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files from DDOS C2 servers. The attackers' goal is to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and cause significant damage to Next Media's network.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File - This TTP involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection. In this case, the attackers used single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
- T1499: Endpoint Denial of Service - This TTP involves disrupting or denying service to a system or network, which aligns with the attackers' goal of causing a 'total failure' to Next Media's network.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the attackers' goal of launching DDOS attacks and causing significant damage, it is unlikely that they would reboot the target system after completing the wiping processes. Instead, they would likely proceed with the intended action, which is to launch the DDOS attacks.

Answer Choice A: Yes - This choice suggests that the attackers rebooted the target system, which contradicts the attackers' goal of launching DDOS attacks.

Answer Choice B: No - This choice suggests that the attackers did not reboot the target system, which aligns with the attackers' goal of launching DDOS attacks.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers encoded configuration files using single-byte XOR keys to evade detection.
2. The attackers' goal is to launch DDOS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and cause significant damage to Next Media's network.
3. The attackers would not reboot the target system after completing the wiping processes, as this would prevent them from achieving their goal.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers did not reboot the target system.

Final Answer: B
