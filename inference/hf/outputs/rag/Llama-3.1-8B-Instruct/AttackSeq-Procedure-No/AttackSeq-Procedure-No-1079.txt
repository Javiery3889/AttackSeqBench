To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by a campaign. The sequence involves defense evasion through obfuscation of a backdoor payload, followed by the use of decoded scripts to drop components for persistence. The question asks whether this sequence is likely to occur after initial access is gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded encoded PowerShell scripts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001 - PowerShell: This indicates the use of PowerShell for execution.
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010 - Command Obfuscation: This involves obfuscating commands to evade detection.
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to make them usable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence of defense evasion through obfuscation, followed by the use of decoded scripts for persistence. The related TTPs support this sequence, as they involve command obfuscation (T1027.010) and deobfuscation/decoding (T1140).
   - The use of PowerShell (T1059.001) is also relevant, as it is mentioned in the question as a means of executing scripts.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence after initial access is gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded encoded PowerShell scripts. This aligns with the TTPs provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The campaign employs defense evasion through obfuscation (T1027.010) to make the backdoor payload harder to detect.
   - The obfuscated payload is then decoded (T1140) to make it usable.
   - The decoded scripts are used to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence.
   - The initial access is gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded encoded PowerShell scripts, which are executed through macro-triggered events (T1059.001).

5. **Final Answer:**
   Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence only after the initial access gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing these scripts through macro-triggered events.

Final Answer: A
