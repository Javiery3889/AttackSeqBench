To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Rising Sun implant. The implant has already exfiltrated data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to a control server. Now, it needs to communicate with control servers and perform initial reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This TTP is related to encoding data, which is already mentioned in the question.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This TTP is related to encrypted or encoded files, which might be relevant to the communication channel.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This TTP is related to deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which might be relevant to the data exfiltrated by the Rising Sun implant.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the data was exfiltrated obfuscated with Base64 encoding. This aligns with T1132.001-Standard Encoding.
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 only. This aligns with T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File, which involves encrypted or encoded files.
   - The question also mentions that the implant will perform initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information. This is a common step after establishing communication with the control server.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4, which aligns with the Defense Evasion technique of using encrypted or encoded files.

**Final Answer: A**
