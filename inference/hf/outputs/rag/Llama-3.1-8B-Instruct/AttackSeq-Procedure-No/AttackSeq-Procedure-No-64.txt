To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether Grandoreiro will enumerate domain users using AdFind after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software. This implies that we are looking for a sequence of actions that starts with gathering information about the system and then proceeds to enumerate domain users.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1087.002-Domain Account: This TTP is related to the enumeration of domain accounts, which is a key part of the question.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the initial action described in the question.
   - T1033-System Owner/User Discovery: This TTP is also related to gathering information about the system, specifically the owner or user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a sequence of actions starting with gathering information about the system (computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software) and then enumerating domain users.
   - The Related TTPs provide insight into the tactics and techniques used in the attack. T1082 and T1033 are related to gathering system information, which aligns with the initial action in the question.
   - T1087.002 is directly related to enumerating domain accounts, which is the second part of the sequence described in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is gathering system information (T1082 and T1033) and then enumerating domain accounts (T1087.002). This matches the sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
