Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether the threat actor, FamousSparrow, will use a specific sequence of tactics and techniques to steal application access tokens. The question is focused on the likelihood of a particular sequence of actions.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to Initial Access, specifically T1566.002, which is Spearphishing Link. This technique involves using phishing emails with malicious links to trick victims into accessing a malicious website or downloading malware.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the threat actor is likely to use spearphishing links to gain initial access. The question asks if this is followed by stealing application access tokens, collecting system information, and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of a threat actor who has gained initial access through spearphishing. After gaining access, the next logical step would be to collect system information and probe files to gather more information about the system and its vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor will use spearphishing links to gain initial access, and then proceed to steal application access tokens, collect system information, and probe files.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The threat actor uses spearphishing links to gain initial access (T1566.002).
2. With initial access gained, the threat actor would likely attempt to steal application access tokens to escalate privileges and gain further access to the system.
3. After gaining access tokens, the threat actor would collect system information to understand the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
4. Finally, the threat actor would probe files to gather more information about the system and its contents.

Final Answer: A
