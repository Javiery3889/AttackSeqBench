To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained persistence by creating new user accounts with RSA keys for backdoor access. The question asks if it's likely that attackers will use Process Doppelgänging to inject into a target process while escalating privileges on the underlying host.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a process to elevate privileges.
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging: This is a specific method of process injection where an attacker creates a duplicate of a legitimate process to inject malicious code.
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging: This is the same technique as above but categorized under defense evasion, which implies that the attacker is using process doppelgänging to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the attackers have already gained persistence through backdoor access, the next logical step would be to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system. Process injection (T1055) is a common technique used for privilege escalation.
   - Process Doppelgänging (T1055.013) is a specific method of process injection that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a target process. It's a plausible next step after gaining persistence, as it enables the attackers to escalate privileges and maintain a low profile.
   - The fact that process doppelgänging is also listed under defense evasion (T1055.013) suggests that attackers might use this technique to evade detection, but this doesn't change the likelihood of it being used for privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events is that attackers will use process doppelgänging to inject into a target process while escalating privileges on the underlying host.
   - This is because process doppelgänging is a specific method of process injection, which is a common technique used for privilege escalation.
   - Therefore, the answer is: Final Answer: A
