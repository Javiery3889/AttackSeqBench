To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments to drop the Taidoor malware. The malware is then used for initial access, and the question asks if it will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique is used to exploit vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code.
     - T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: This technique is used to evade detection by virtualization and sandboxing tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the context of the question, the Taidoor malware is likely to employ techniques to evade detection by security tools, such as virtualization and sandboxing.
   - The question specifically asks about anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks, which aligns with the T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion technique.
   - This technique is often used by malware to prevent detection and ensure successful communication with its CnC servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Taidoor malware is used for initial access after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - To ensure successful communication with its CnC servers, the malware would likely employ techniques to evade detection by security tools.
   - Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the malware performing anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   Final Answer: A
