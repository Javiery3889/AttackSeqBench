Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving a backdoor (Milestone) and a C2 (Command and Control) server. The question asks whether the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are related to Exfiltration, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves an attacker exfiltrating data through a C2 channel established earlier in the attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the Milestone backdoor is likely to communicate with the C2 server for the purpose of exfiltrating data. The fact that the question mentions communication over a non-standard port before exfiltration suggests that the attacker is trying to avoid detection by using an uncommon communication channel.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice aligns with the related TTPs, as it suggests that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data, which is consistent with the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.
- B: No - This choice does not align with the related TTPs, as it suggests that the backdoor will not communicate with the C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltration, which contradicts the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of actions involving a backdoor and a C2 server.
2. The related TTPs are related to Exfiltration, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
3. The question asks whether the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data.
4. Given the related TTPs, it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server for the purpose of exfiltration.
5. The fact that the question mentions communication over a non-standard port suggests that the attacker is trying to avoid detection.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: A
