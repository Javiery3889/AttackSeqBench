To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:** The question asks about the sequence of actions an attacker takes after gaining increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals. Specifically, it asks if the attacker ensures persistence within the target network after executing malicious code on a local or remote system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This TTP involves using spearphishing to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing certain actions within the internal network. This is a technique used to move laterally within the network.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts: This TTP involves creating or modifying local accounts to maintain access to a system. This is a method of ensuring persistence on a system.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account: This TTP is similar to the previous one, involving the creation or modification of local accounts to maintain access to a system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of actions after gaining increased privileges. The first TTP (T1534-Internal Spearphishing) is about lateral movement, which is typically done before ensuring persistence. 
   - The question specifically mentions executing malicious code on a local or remote system, which aligns with the idea of gaining increased privileges and then ensuring persistence.
   - The two persistence TTPs (T1078.003-Local Accounts and T1136.001-Local Account) both involve creating or modifying local accounts to maintain access to a system, which is a common method of ensuring persistence.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would execute malicious code on a local or remote system to gain increased privileges, and then ensure persistence by creating or modifying local accounts.

**Final Answer: B: No**
