To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving a malware Dropper module, exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation using specific CVEs.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves Initial Access through exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) and Privilege Escalation through exploitation (T1068).
   - The specific techniques mentioned are Exploit Public-Facing Application and Exploitation for Privilege Escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieve privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
   - The related TTPs support the exploitation of public-facing applications and privilege escalation through exploitation, which aligns with the described sequence of actions.
   - However, the question specifically mentions a Stager module notifying of successful exploitation after the initial access and privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190), which is supported by the related TTPs.
   - The privilege escalation is also supported by the related TTPs (T1068).
   - The Stager module's notification of successful exploitation is a plausible step after the initial access and privilege escalation, as it would be necessary to confirm the successful execution of the exploit chain.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation after the initial access and privilege escalation.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: **A: Yes**
