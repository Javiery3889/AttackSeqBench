Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication after a custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture: This TTP is related to the initial action of capturing screenshots.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols: This TTP is related to the use of File Transfer Protocols (FTP) for C2 communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the initial action is related to collection (screenshot capture) and the subsequent action is related to C2 communication. The question is asking whether the C2 communication will use FTP protocol.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
- The initial action is a collection TTP (T1113-Screen Capture), which is not directly related to C2 communication.
- The subsequent action is a C2 TTP (T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols), which is related to the use of FTP protocol for C2 communication.
- Since the question is asking whether the C2 communication will use FTP protocol, we need to consider whether the C2 communication (T1071.002) is likely to use FTP protocol.

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, T1071.002 is a specific technique that uses File Transfer Protocols (FTP) for C2 communication. Therefore, it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
