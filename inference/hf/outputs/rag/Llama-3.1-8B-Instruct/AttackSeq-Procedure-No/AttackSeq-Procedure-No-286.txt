To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether Elfin, after establishing command and control (C2) using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, is likely to exfiltrate data over Google Drive.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration: This indicates that the attack is focused on stealing data from the compromised system.
   - Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves using automated tools to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the use of POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for C2.
   - Technique: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage: This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services, which includes Google Drive.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Elfin has established C2 using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, which are tools capable of automated exfiltration, it is likely that they would use these tools to exfiltrate data.
   - The use of T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage as a related TTP suggests that Elfin may exfiltrate data to cloud storage services, including Google Drive.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Elfin would exfiltrate data over Google Drive, as it aligns with the use of automated exfiltration tools and the exfiltration to cloud storage technique.

**Final Answer: A**
