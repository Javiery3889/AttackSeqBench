Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker to evade defenses, including retrieving, decrypting, and executing a payload. The question asks whether the attacker will decode and execute base64-encoded blobs based on the victim's system architecture before dropping a DLL file.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTP is T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion. This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to make them more difficult to detect by security software.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question and the related TTP, it is likely that the attacker will use the technique of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to evade detection. The question specifically mentions decoding and executing base64-encoded blobs, which is a common method of encoding and decoding files to evade detection. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker will use this technique before dropping the DLL file.
