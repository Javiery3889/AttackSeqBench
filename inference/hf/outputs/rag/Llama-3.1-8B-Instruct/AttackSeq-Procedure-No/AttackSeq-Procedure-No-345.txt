Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether the malware will use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists after using HTTPS communication for command and control operations.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:
- T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as operating system, architecture, and installed software.
- T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about running processes on the system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely to use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists. The 'tasklist' command is used to display a list of currently running processes, which aligns with T1057-Process Discovery. The 'systeminfo' command is used to display system information, which aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication for command and control operations, and then use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware uses HTTPS communication for command and control operations, which is a common technique used by adversaries to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
2. After establishing command and control operations, the malware is likely to use techniques to gather information about the system, which is a common next step in the attack sequence.
3. The 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a common technique used to gather system information and process lists, which aligns with the related TTPs.

Final Answer: A
