Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving Gamaredon, a threat actor, using backdoors to list interesting files and then potentially uploading them to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question asks whether Gamaredon will automatically upload the harvested documents before scanning all drives for sensitive data.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs indicate that Gamaredon is likely to engage in data collection activities, including:

1. T1025-Data from Removable Media: This technique suggests that Gamaredon may collect data from removable media, such as USB drives.
2. T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive: This technique indicates that Gamaredon may collect data from network shared drives.
3. T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique suggests that Gamaredon may discover files and directories on the compromised system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that Gamaredon is focused on data collection. The question asks whether Gamaredon will upload the harvested documents before scanning all drives for sensitive data.
