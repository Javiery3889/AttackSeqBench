Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes APT15 deploying backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) and using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution. It then asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access to a network.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1552.004-Private Keys: This technique involves obtaining private keys to access encrypted data or systems.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager: This technique involves accessing Windows Credential Manager to obtain credentials.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that APT15 is likely using techniques related to credential access and initial access. The use of domain accounts (T1078.002) and private keys (T1552.004) suggests that APT15 is trying to gain access to the network and obtain sensitive information. The use of Windows Credential Manager (T1555.004) further supports this, as it is a common method for storing and accessing credentials.

Considering the use of backdoors and the bypassing of command prompt policy settings, it is plausible that APT15 would use Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. Mimikatz is a popular tool used for credential dumping and stealing, which aligns with the techniques listed in the related TTPs.

Additionally, the use of a VPN certificate to access the network remotely is consistent with the use of private keys (T1552.004) and domain accounts (T1078.002).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

Final Answer: A
