To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question is asking whether Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer before employing evasion techniques to avoid detection.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs are:
        - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: This TTP is related to evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments.
        - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks: This TTP is related to checking the system for specific conditions to evade detection.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - Based on the related TTPs, it seems that Grandoreiro is likely to employ evasion techniques to avoid detection. However, the question asks whether it will collect information about the victim's computer before employing these evasion techniques.
    - Typically, attackers would want to gather information about the victim's system to tailor their attacks and evade detection more effectively. This suggests that the correct answer is likely to be affirmative.

4.  Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    - Grandoreiro is likely to collect information about the victim's computer to tailor its attack and evade detection more effectively.
    - Employing evasion techniques such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments would be more effective if Grandoreiro has prior knowledge of the victim's system.
    - Therefore, it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer before employing numerous tricks to evade detection and emulation.

5.  Final Answer:
    Final Answer: A
