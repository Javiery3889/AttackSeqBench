Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the NewPass implant, including using a loader library to decode the configuration file and evade detection. It then asks if the malware will initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is typically encrypted.
- T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to evade detection.
- T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over an unencrypted protocol other than a C2 channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely to use techniques to evade detection and exfiltrate data. The question asks if the malware will initiate a download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

- T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is already mentioned in the question, so it's a given that the malware will use this technique to evade detection.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the malware will exfiltrate data over an encrypted channel, which is in contrast to the question's mention of encrypted POST requests.
- T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol suggests that the malware may exfiltrate data over an unencrypted protocol, which aligns with the question's mention of FTP.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will initiate a download via FTP (an unencrypted protocol) before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

Final Answer: A
