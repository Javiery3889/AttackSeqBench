Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether RIG EK (Rig Exploit Kit) uses a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to deliver exploits through malvertising. The question focuses on the delivery of exploits after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- T1583.008-Malvertising: This technique involves using malicious advertising to deliver malware or exploits.
- T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts or commands.
- T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a system by exploiting vulnerabilities in a website or application.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attack sequence likely involves:
1. Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise): The user visits a compromised website or clicks on a malicious ad.
2. Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell): The compromised website or ad executes an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
3. Resource Development (T1583.008-Malvertising): The PowerShell script fetches malware or exploits through malvertising.

Considering the question, the answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware. This matches the sequence of TTPs described above.

Final Answer: A
