Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks (This TTP is related to reconnaissance, which is an initial phase of the attack, but it's not directly related to the Discovery phase or the Sednit group's tactics)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery (This TTP is related to the Discovery phase, which involves gathering information about the target environment)
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic (This TTP is related to the Execution phase, which involves executing malicious code, and is specifically related to VBA macros)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the Sednit group's tactics involve using VBA macros to establish initial access (T1059.005-Visual Basic) and then moving to the Discovery phase (T1046-Network Service Discovery) to gather information about the target environment. The question asks whether they will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning during the Discovery phase. Given the context of the related TTPs, it is plausible that the Sednit group would use vulnerability scanning (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) as part of their Discovery phase to identify potential vulnerabilities in government and critical infrastructure organizations.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. The Sednit group launches campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
2. The group moves to the Discovery phase and uses Network Service Discovery (T1046) to gather information about the target environment.
3. As part of the Discovery phase, the group targets IP ranges for vulnerability scanning (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) to identify potential vulnerabilities in government and critical infrastructure organizations.

Final Answer: A
