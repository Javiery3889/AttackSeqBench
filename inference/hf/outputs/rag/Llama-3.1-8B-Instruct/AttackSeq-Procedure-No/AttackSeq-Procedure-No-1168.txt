To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. This implies that we need to understand the sequence of actions taken by ProjectM actors.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1583.001-Domains: This technique is related to the registration or acquisition of domain names. It's a part of the Resource Development tactic, which involves creating or acquiring resources that can be used in the attack.
   - T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations: This technique is used to gather information about the physical location of a target. It's a part of the Reconnaissance tactic, which involves gathering information about the target.
   - T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains: This technique is used to gather information about a target by searching open websites and domains. It's also a part of the Reconnaissance tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains. This aligns with the T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains technique.
   - The question also asks if they collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites. This aligns with the T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations technique.
   - The question implies that this information collection is done before executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. This suggests that the actors are gathering information about their targets before moving forward with the attack.

Based on the related TTPs and the question, it's likely that ProjectM actors collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

**Final Answer: A**
