To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether attackers are likely to use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise: This is the technique of compromising a software supply chain to gain initial access to a system.
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain: This is a more specific technique of compromising a software supply chain, which is a key part of the initial access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - To use a compromised software update as an initial access vector, attackers would typically need to first obtain the software update, which could involve using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services to access the software update. This would allow them to obtain the compromised software update without arousing suspicion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Attackers often use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services to obtain software updates, patches, or other software components.
   - Compromising a software supply chain (T1195.002) is a common tactic used by attackers to gain initial access to a system.
   - Using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is a common precursor to using a compromised software update as an initial access vector.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, it is likely that attackers would use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

Final Answer: A
