Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Rising Sun implant, which is likely a type of malware. The question asks whether the implant will collect browser bookmark information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP is related to the communication between the malware and the control servers, which is likely to be HTTP POST requests.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery: This TTP is related to the collection of information about the browser, which could include bookmarks.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the Rising Sun implant is likely to use HTTP POST requests for communication with control servers (T1071.001-Web Protocols). Additionally, the implant is likely to collect browser information, including bookmarks, as part of its discovery phase (T1217-Browser Information Discovery). Therefore, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant will collect browser bookmark information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant has already ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
2. As part of its discovery phase, the implant is likely to collect information about the system and the browser.
3. The implant is likely to use HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers.
4. Given the related TTPs, it is plausible that the implant will collect browser bookmark information as part of its discovery phase.

Final Answer: A
