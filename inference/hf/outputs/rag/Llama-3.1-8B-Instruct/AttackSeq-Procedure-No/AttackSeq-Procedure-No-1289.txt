To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether Mustang Panda, a known threat actor, is likely to use the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses within their spearphishing campaign. The question mentions that Mustang Panda is utilizing documents attempting to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves using a malicious file to carry out an attack. It's related to the initial access tactic.
   - T1036.007-Double File Extension: This technique involves using a double file extension to evade detection. It's related to the defense evasion tactic.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spearphishing to gain initial access to a system. It's related to the initial access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that Mustang Panda is using documents to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses, which aligns with the malicious file technique (T1204.002-Malicious File).
   - The question also asks about the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk), which is a technique used for defense evasion (T1036.007-Double File Extension).
   - Given that Mustang Panda is using spearphishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) as part of their communication strategy, it's likely that they would use techniques to evade detection, such as the double extension trick.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Mustang Panda would use spearphishing to gain initial access, then use malicious files to communicate with C2 domains and IP addresses, and finally use the double extension trick to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
