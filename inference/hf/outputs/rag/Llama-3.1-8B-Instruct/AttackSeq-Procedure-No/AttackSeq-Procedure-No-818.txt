To answer this question, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks if WinDealer will use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication before it steals information from SNS (Social Network Service) applications and encrypts this data using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. T1048.003 - Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol without encryption.
2. T1048.001 - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol with symmetric encryption.
3. T1071.002 - File Transfer Protocols: This technique involves using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that T1048.003 and T1048.001 are related to exfiltration over non-C2 protocols, which is not relevant to C2 communication. T1071.002 is related to using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

Given the question, we are looking for a sequence of TTPs that involves using FTP for C2 communication before stealing information and encrypting it. The most relevant TTP is T1071.002, which involves using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

However, the question specifically asks about using FTP for C2 communication, which is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs. But, FTP is a type of file transfer protocol, so it's likely that the correct answer is related to using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question asks about using FTP for C2 communication, which is related to T1071.002.
2. The question also mentions stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting it using AES, but this is not directly related to the TTPs.
3. Since FTP is a type of file transfer protocol, it's likely that the correct answer is related to using file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
