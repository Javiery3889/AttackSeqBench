Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance and is using RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration. The question asks if it is likely that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. In this case, the Rising Sun implant is already using Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to evade detection. However, this technique is not directly related to the communication method between the implant and the control server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the Rising Sun implant is using encoding techniques to evade detection. Since the implant is already using Base64 encoding for data exfiltration, it is likely that it would continue to use similar techniques for communication with the control server. However, the use of RC4 encryption is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

Considering the provided answer choices, option A suggests that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. This aligns with the encoding technique (T1132.001-Standard Encoding) already used by the implant for data exfiltration.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant would continue to use encoding techniques for communication with the control server. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
