Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking about the sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by the Sednit group. The question specifically asks if the group is likely to query the Registry for installed applications before the AutoIt downloader conducts extensive reconnaissance and detects sandbox or virtual environments.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1012-Query Registry: This TTP involves the adversary querying the registry to gather information about the system.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading: This TTP involves disguising malicious files or processes to evade detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the Sednit group is likely to use masquerading to disguise their initial access (disguising email attachments) and then use the AutoIt downloader for further reconnaissance. The question specifically asks if they will query the Registry for installed applications before conducting extensive reconnaissance. 

Considering the TTPs, it is logical that the group would query the Registry (T1012) to gather information about the system before conducting extensive reconnaissance (T1043) with the AutoIt downloader. This would help them understand the system's environment and identify potential sandbox or virtual environments.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Sednit group will query the Registry for installed applications before conducting extensive reconnaissance with the AutoIt downloader.

Final Answer: A
