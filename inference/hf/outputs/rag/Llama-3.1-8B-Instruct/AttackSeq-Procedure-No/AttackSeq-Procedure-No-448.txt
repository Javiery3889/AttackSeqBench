Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an adversary, 'Agrius', is using an 'IPsec Helper' to receive commands from C2 servers. The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions as part of its data destruction activities.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction: This technique is used to delete or destroy data on a system.
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe: This technique is used to wipe the disk structure, which can include wiping files, folders, and other data on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that Agrius is likely to engage in data destruction activities. The question specifically asks if Agrius will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions. Given the context of the related TTPs, it is reasonable to assume that Agrius would use a technique like CaddyWiper to achieve this goal.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where Agrius is using an 'IPsec Helper' to receive commands from C2 servers, which suggests a level of sophistication and coordination in the attack.
- The related TTPs indicate that Agrius is likely to engage in data destruction activities, specifically wiping files and disk structures.
- CaddyWiper is a tool that can be used for data destruction, particularly in the context of wiping files and disk structures.
- Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper to achieve its data destruction goals.

Final Answer: A
