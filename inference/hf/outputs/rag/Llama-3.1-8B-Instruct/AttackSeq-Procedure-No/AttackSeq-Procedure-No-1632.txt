Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether an adversary is likely to divide large files into smaller chunks before collecting data from a Microsoft SharePoint Online repository, given that the file size is 0x1000000 bytes or more.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1213.002 - SharePoint: This TTP is related to the collection of data from a SharePoint repository.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits: This TTP is related to the exfiltration of data, specifically the limitation of data transfer size.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the adversary has already compressed and encrypted large chunks of data and is preparing to exfiltrate them. The question is asking whether they will divide the files further before collecting them from SharePoint Online.

Considering the Related TTPs, T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits is relevant to the exfiltration phase, which is the phase the adversary is currently in. This TTP suggests that adversaries may divide files to avoid exceeding data transfer size limits during exfiltration.

Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before collecting data from SharePoint Online to avoid exceeding data transfer size limits during exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
