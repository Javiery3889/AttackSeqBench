Analysis of the Question:
The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish communication with C2 servers. It then asks if the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1572-Protocol Tunneling: This technique involves using a protocol to hide or disguise malicious communication. In this case, the CostaRicto Campaign used DNS and HTTP protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication. This is the opposite of what the question is asking.
- T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not used for C2 communication and is not encrypted.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the CostaRicto Campaign used protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers, it is likely that they would not use the same protocol for exfiltration. The question specifically asks about exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol, which aligns with T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol. This technique suggests that the attackers would use a different protocol for exfiltration, which is not used for C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign used protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with C2 servers.
2. This indicates that they are using a specific protocol for C2 communication.
3. The question asks about exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
4. T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol is the most relevant technique, as it involves exfiltration over a protocol that is not used for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
