To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system after delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.005-Hidden File System
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - The first TTP (T1564.005-Hidden File System) is related to hiding a file system, which is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - The second TTP (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is related to gaining initial access through spearphishing attachments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware delivered spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access. This aligns with the second TTP (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - The question then asks if they used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers. This action is related to the first TTP (T1564.005-Hidden File System), which is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - Given that the initial access was gained through spearphishing, it is plausible that the attackers would use a technique like hiding a file system to evade detection and establish communication with their C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through spearphishing, which aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - The question then asks about the use of a hidden file system, which aligns with T1564.005-Hidden File System.
   - Given the context, it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

Final Answer: A
