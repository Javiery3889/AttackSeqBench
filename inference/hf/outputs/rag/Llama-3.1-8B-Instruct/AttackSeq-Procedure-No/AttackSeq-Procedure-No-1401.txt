Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker, FIN13, is collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. It asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use specific tools for lateral movement and then leverage native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction (This TTP is related to the impact of the attack, not the tactics used for lateral movement or reconnaissance)
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (This TTP is related to the use of Windows Management Instrumentation for execution, which is relevant to the question)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that FIN13 is likely to use Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047) for execution, which is relevant to the question. The question asks about the use of Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. This is consistent with the use of Windows Management Instrumentation for execution.

The question also mentions leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery. This is a plausible next step after lateral movement.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 will use Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

Final Answer: A
