Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where an APT phishing email is delivered, a link to malware is clicked, and a VBScript is executed, leading to the execution of a .doc file. The question asks whether the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1053.003-Cron: This technique involves using the cron utility to schedule a job to run at a specified time or interval.
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves executing a malicious file, which in this case is the .doc file.
- T1053.003-Cron: This technique is related to persistence, where the malware installs itself as a cron job.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the sequence of events described in the question, the malware has already been executed by opening a .doc file. The question asks whether the malware will use the cron utility instead of PowerShell for further execution. 

Considering the related TTPs, T1053.003-Cron is related to persistence, which typically occurs after the initial execution of malware. The fact that the malware has already been executed by opening a .doc file suggests that the initial execution has occurred, and the question is asking about the next step in the attack sequence.

Given this context, it is unlikely that the malware would use the cron utility for further execution after it has already been executed. PowerShell is a more common choice for post-execution activities, as it provides a powerful scripting engine for automating tasks.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware will not use the cron utility for further execution.

Final Answer: B
