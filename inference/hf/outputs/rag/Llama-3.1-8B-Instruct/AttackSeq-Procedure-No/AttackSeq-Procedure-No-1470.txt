Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. This involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the malware and the context of the attack.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks: This TTP involves gathering information about the target system or network through user activity, which is relevant to the reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic: This TTP involves using Visual Basic (VB) scripts to execute payloads, which is related to the macro execution mentioned in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers are using user activity-based checks for discovery and Visual Basic scripts for execution. However, the question specifically asks about the use of Ruby scripts. While Ruby is a programming language, it is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

However, considering the context of the question, it is likely that the attackers will use a scripting language to execute payloads after being installed on the network. Given the options, we can evaluate each choice:

- A: Yes: This choice suggests that the attackers will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads, which is not directly supported by the provided TTPs.
- B: No: This choice suggests that the attackers will not use Ruby scripts, which is more plausible given the context of the question and the provided TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions reconnaissance activities and employee-enabled macro execution, which is related to T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks and T1059.005-Visual Basic.
2. The question asks about the use of Ruby scripts, which is not directly related to the provided TTPs.
3. Considering the context of the question, it is likely that the attackers will use a scripting language for execution, but the provided TTPs do not directly support the use of Ruby scripts.
4. Based on the analysis, choice B is the most plausible answer.

Final Answer: B
