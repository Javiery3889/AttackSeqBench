Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving CosmicDuke, which is likely a threat actor. The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to use specific tools (keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) after exfiltrating data via FTP and searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This TTP indicates the use of automated methods to exfiltrate data from a system.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging: This TTP involves using a keylogger to collect sensitive information, such as login credentials.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This TTP involves collecting data from the local system, which could include various types of information.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that CosmicDuke is likely to engage in data collection activities after exfiltration. The use of a keylogger (T1056.001-Keylogging), screenshotter, and clipboard stealer would be consistent with data collection goals. However, the question specifies that CosmicDuke would search removable drives and skip certain file types during collection.

Considering the TTPs, the keylogger and clipboard stealer are more likely to be used after data exfiltration, as they are used for data collection. The screenshotter could be used for reconnaissance or data collection, but it's not as directly related to the data collection process as the keylogger and clipboard stealer.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve data exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) followed by data collection (T1005-Data from Local System), which could include the use of a keylogger (T1056.001-Keylogging), screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

Final Answer: B
