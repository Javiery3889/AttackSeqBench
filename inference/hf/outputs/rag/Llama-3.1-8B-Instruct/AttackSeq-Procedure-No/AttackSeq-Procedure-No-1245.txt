Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Orion source code has been modified to inject the SUNBURST backdoor. The question asks if SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves an adversary gathering information about the system or network by discovering running processes.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves an adversary evading detection by making files or information difficult to identify.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the adversary has already modified the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor, which suggests a level of sophistication and potential for evasive techniques. However, the question specifically asks about the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the system or network.

Considering the related TTPs, the Discovery tactic (T1057-Process Discovery) is relevant to the question. The technique of monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe is a plausible action for an adversary to take as part of the Discovery tactic. This action would allow the adversary to gather information about the system or network.

The Defense Evasion tactic (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) is not directly relevant to the question, as it involves evading detection rather than gathering information.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible answer is that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

Final Answer: A
