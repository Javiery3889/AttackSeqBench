Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the threat actor, FamousSparrow, will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery (collecting system information)
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping (dumping credentials using Mimikatz)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that the threat actor is using Mimikatz for Credential Access (T1003) and then likely wants to use the obtained credentials for further actions. The Discovery phase (T1082) is a common phase that follows the initial access and credential gathering phase, where the threat actor collects information about the system to identify potential targets and plan further actions.

Considering the typical attack sequence, it is logical that the threat actor would use the obtained credentials to gather more information about the system, such as system information and probing files, as part of the Discovery phase.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actor uses a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access (T1003) to dump credentials from compromised systems.
2. The obtained credentials are then used for further actions, which typically include the Discovery phase (T1082).
3. In the Discovery phase, the threat actor collects system information and probes files to identify potential targets and plan further actions.

Final Answer: A
