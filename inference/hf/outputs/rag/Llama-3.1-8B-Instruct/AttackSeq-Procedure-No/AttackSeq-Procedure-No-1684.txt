Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a banking Trojan. The Trojan first searches for folders related to antivirus and banking software and collects system information. Then, it is asked if the malware will collect files from network shared drives instead of capturing screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This TTP involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the Trojan collecting system information.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery: This TTP involves discovering information about the browser, which aligns with the Trojan capturing screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture: This TTP involves capturing the screen, which also aligns with the Trojan capturing screenshots.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, the question is asking if the Trojan will switch from collecting system information and searching for folders to collecting files from network shared drives. However, the related TTPs suggest that the Trojan is focused on collecting information related to the system and the user's browsing activity. Collecting files from network shared drives is not directly related to the TTPs provided.

Considering the TTPs, the most plausible sequence of actions for the Trojan would be to continue collecting information related to the system and the user's browsing activity, rather than switching to collecting files from network shared drives.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the Trojan is likely to continue collecting information related to the system and the user's browsing activity, rather than switching to collecting files from network shared drives.

Final Answer: B
