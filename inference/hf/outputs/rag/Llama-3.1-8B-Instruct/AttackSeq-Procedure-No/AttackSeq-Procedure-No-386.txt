Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where APT15 has already obtained domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, which suggests they have a high level of access to the network. The question asks whether APT15 would use valid account information (such as VPN credentials) to access the network remotely or deploy backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs all involve the use of "Valid Accounts" (T1078), which indicates that the attackers are using legitimate credentials to access the network. This tactic is often used for initial access, persistence, and defense evasion.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that APT15 already has domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, it is likely that they would use these valid account information to access the network remotely, rather than deploying additional backdoors. This is because using valid accounts reduces the risk of detection and allows for more stealthy and persistent access to the network.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT15 has already obtained domain administrator credentials, which is a high level of access.
2. They also have a VPN certificate, which provides additional access to the network.
3. The related TTPs all involve the use of valid accounts, which suggests that APT15 is likely to use these credentials for access.
4. Deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS would increase the risk of detection and is not necessary given the existing access.

Final Answer: A
