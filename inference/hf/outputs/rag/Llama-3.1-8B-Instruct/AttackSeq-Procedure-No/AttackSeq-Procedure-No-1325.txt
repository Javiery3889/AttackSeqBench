Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Sayad malware will capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts after performing discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data: This TTP involves archiving or exfiltrating the collected data, which is what the Sayad malware has already done by exfiltrating the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture: This TTP involves capturing screenshots or other visual data from the compromised host.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the Sayad malware has already completed the data collection and exfiltration phase (T1560-Archive Collected Data). The next logical step for the malware would be to continue collecting data, but the question is asking if it will capture screenshots specifically after performing discovery.

Considering the order of operations, it is more likely that the malware would perform discovery (collecting system and application details) before capturing screenshots, as discovery is a necessary step to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further data collection.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Sayad malware has already exfiltrated the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server, indicating it has completed the data collection and exfiltration phase.
2. The next step for the malware would be to continue collecting data, but it needs to understand the environment first.
3. Capturing screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture) is a form of data collection, and it is more logical to perform discovery (collecting system and application details) before capturing screenshots.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Sayad malware will proceed with capturing screenshots as part of its data collection efforts only after performing discovery.

Final Answer: B
