To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the Korplug variant will use ICMP in C2 (Command and Control) communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media: This TTP indicates that the attacker is collecting data from removable media, which is a common tactic in data exfiltration or intelligence gathering.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This TTP indicates that the attacker is collecting data from the local system, which can include sensitive information such as credentials, system configurations, or other valuable data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the Korplug variant collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This suggests that the attacker is gathering information from various sources.
   - The question then asks whether ICMP will be used in C2 communications after data collection. To determine this, we need to consider the typical communication methods used by the Korplug variant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Korplug is a variant of the PlugX malware, which is known to use various communication protocols for C2, including HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS tunneling.
   - ICMP is not a typical protocol used by Korplug for C2 communications. However, it's possible that the variant might use ICMP for specific purposes, such as evasion or stealth.
   - Given the information provided, it's unlikely that ICMP would be used for C2 communications after data collection, as it's not a standard protocol for this purpose.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that ICMP will not be used in C2 communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

Final Answer: B
