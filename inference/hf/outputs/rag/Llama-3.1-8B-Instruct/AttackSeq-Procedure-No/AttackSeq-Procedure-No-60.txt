Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer. This implies that the actor is trying to avoid detection while gathering information.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot: This technique involves booting a system in safe mode to evade detection by security software or to gain access to a system without triggering security measures.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as operating system details and installed security products.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that the actor is trying to evade detection (Defense Evasion) and gather information about the system (Discovery). Restarting a compromised machine in safe mode (T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot) would allow the actor to bypass security software and gain access to the system without triggering any security measures. This would enable the actor to collect information about the system (T1082-System Information Discovery) without being detected.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer.

Final Answer: A
