Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the GreyEnergy group has compromised a computer and is using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials. The question asks whether the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They are categorized under three tactics: Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Execution.

- T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique is used to identify the presence of a system or network. It is likely used in the initial stages of the attack to gather information about the target network.
- T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique is used to transfer tools across the network to maintain persistence and move laterally. It is a key component of lateral movement.
- T1072-Software Deployment Tools: This technique is used to deploy software on a system. It is often used to install malware or other tools on compromised systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the GreyEnergy group is likely to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. PDQ Deploy is a software deployment tool that can be used to transfer files and install software on remote systems. This aligns with the T1072-Software Deployment Tools technique.

The GreyEnergy group has already used Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, which suggests they are in the lateral movement phase of the attack. Using PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network would be a logical next step in this phase.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

Final Answer: A
