To answer this question, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks if Black Energy 2 will perform a specific set of actions on a victim system. The actions include:

1. Mounting and binding to the "/proc/" filepath
2. Enabling subsequent operation in memory
3. Removing on-disk artifacts
4. Evading defenses by encrypting its payload
5. Loading plugins directly onto the infected machine

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.009 - Proc Memory: This TTP involves using the "/proc/" filepath to access and manipulate process memory. This is relevant to the first action mentioned in the question.
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File: This TTP involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection. This is relevant to the fourth action mentioned in the question.
3. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.011 - Fileless Storage: This TTP involves storing malware in memory rather than on disk. This is relevant to the second and third actions mentioned in the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**

Based on the related TTPs, we can see that Black Energy 2 is likely to use techniques that involve evading defenses, accessing process memory, and storing malware in memory. The question mentions that Black Energy 2 will "mount and bind to the /proc/ filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory", which aligns with T1055.009 - Proc Memory.

The question also mentions that Black Energy 2 will "remove on-disk artifacts", which aligns with the fileless storage concept in T1027.011 - Fileless Storage. Additionally, the question mentions that Black Energy 2 will "evade defenses by encrypting its payload", which aligns with T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File.

The question also mentions that Black Energy 2 will "load plugins directly onto the infected machine", which is a common behavior of fileless malware that uses plugins to extend its functionality.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Black Energy 2 is likely to use techniques that involve evading defenses, accessing process memory, and storing malware in memory.
2. The question mentions that Black Energy 2 will "mount and bind to the /proc/ filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory", which aligns with T1055.009 - Proc Memory.
3. The question also mentions that Black Energy 2 will "remove on-disk artifacts", which aligns with the fileless storage concept in T1027.011 - Fileless Storage.
4. The question mentions that Black Energy 2 will "evade defenses by encrypting its payload", which aligns with T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File.
5. The question also mentions that Black Energy 2 will "load plugins directly onto the infected machine", which is a common behavior of fileless malware that uses plugins to extend its functionality.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the analysis of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Black Energy 2 will indeed mount and bind to the "/proc/" filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory while also removing on-disk artifacts after evading defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

Final Answer: A
