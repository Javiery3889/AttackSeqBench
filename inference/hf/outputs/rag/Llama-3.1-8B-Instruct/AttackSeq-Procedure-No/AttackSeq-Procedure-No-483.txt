Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involving the execution of SparrowDoor via cmd.exe, communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server, and the use of an encrypted HTTPS channel. The question asks whether it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell

The first TTP (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) indicates the exploitation of vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. The second TTP (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell) involves the use of a Windows command shell, which is consistent with the execution of SparrowDoor via cmd.exe.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the information provided, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application). This is followed by the execution of SparrowDoor via a Windows command shell (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell), which is consistent with the use of cmd.exe in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

Final Answer: A
