Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by FIN13, a threat group. It mentions the use of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server for command execution, and the potential use of external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. The question asks whether FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (establishing command and control channels using web protocols)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell (deploying web shells for persistence)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (using multi-stage channels for command and control)

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that FIN13 uses web protocols for command and control and deploys web shells for persistence. The question asks whether they will use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware after establishing persistence with other methods.

Considering the TTPs, it is likely that FIN13 will use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access after establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. This is because the TTPs suggest that FIN13 uses web protocols for command and control and deploys web shells for persistence, which aligns with the use of external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. FIN13 uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.
2. They establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
3. After establishing persistence, they are likely to use external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.

Final Answer: A
