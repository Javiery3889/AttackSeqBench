Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Rising Sun implant, which initially performs reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. The question then asks if it is likely that the implant communicated with C2 (Command and Control) using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to Command and Control (Tactic) and Bidirectional Communication (Technique T1102.002). Bidirectional Communication refers to the exchange of information between the attacker's C2 server and the compromised system. This technique can involve various communication protocols and methods, including using blogs and WordPress.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice as follows:

- Answer Choice A: Yes - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. This aligns with the related TTPs, as bidirectional communication is a key aspect of C2, and using blogs and WordPress as a communication channel is a plausible method for achieving this.

- Answer Choice B: No - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant did not communicate with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. While this is a possible scenario, it does not align as well with the related TTPs, which specifically mention bidirectional communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the Rising Sun implant performing reconnaissance, which is a precursor to C2 communication.
2. The related TTPs mention bidirectional communication, which is a key aspect of C2.
3. Using blogs and WordPress as a communication channel for bidirectional communication is a plausible method, given the related TTPs.
4. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the Rising Sun implant communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

Final Answer: A
