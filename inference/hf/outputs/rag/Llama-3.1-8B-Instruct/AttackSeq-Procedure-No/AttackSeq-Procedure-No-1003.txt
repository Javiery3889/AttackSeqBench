Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Longhorn's malware. The key points are:
- The malware communicates externally for scheduled exfiltration.
- The communication is done to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
- The question asks if the malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely using web protocols for C&C communication (T1071.001) and is also exfiltrating data using scheduled transfers (T1029). The question mentions that the malware communicates externally for scheduled exfiltration, which aligns with T1029. The question also asks about configuring a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication over HTTPS, which aligns with T1071.001.

Given this information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the malware using web protocols for C&C communication, which would likely involve configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the malware is likely using web protocols for C&C communication, which would involve configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
