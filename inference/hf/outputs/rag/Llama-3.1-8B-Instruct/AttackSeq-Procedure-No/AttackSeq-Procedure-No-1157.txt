Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. The messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges. After this, the attackers are likely to perform a specific action on the compromised accounts.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1656-Impersonation: This TTP involves the attackers impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts: This TTP involves the attackers compromising accounts, which could be a result of the phishing messages.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts: This TTP specifically involves compromising email accounts, which could be a part of the account compromise.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, the attackers have already compromised accounts through phishing messages. The next logical step would be to use the compromised accounts for further malicious activities. Changing account passwords only would not be a typical next step in this scenario, as the attackers have already compromised the accounts. Instead, the attackers would likely use the compromised accounts to collect more sensitive information.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The attackers have already compromised accounts through phishing messages (T1656-Impersonation and T1586-Compromise Accounts). The next step would be to use the compromised accounts to collect more information, which is likely to be done by using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials (T1586.002-Email Accounts). Therefore, it is unlikely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect more information.

Final Answer: B
