To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the Sednit group's operators will use a specific sequence of tactics and techniques to gain initial access. The question mentions COM object hijacking for persistence and the distribution of Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This TTP involves using spearphishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking: This TTP involves hijacking COM objects to maintain persistence on a system.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions COM object hijacking for persistence, which aligns with T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking.
   - The question also mentions distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails, which aligns with T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - The question asks if this will happen after using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader, which suggests a multi-stage attack.
   - Given the multi-stage nature of the attack and the use of COM object hijacking for persistence, it is likely that the Sednit group's operators will use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader before distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Sednit group's operators use COM object hijacking for persistence (T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking).
   - After establishing persistence, they use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
   - The new downloader is likely used to gain initial access through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) or links (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - The question specifically mentions distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails, which aligns with T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Sednit group's operators will use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader before distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
