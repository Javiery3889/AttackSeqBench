To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services, following initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information: This technique is related to reconnaissance, which involves gathering information about the victim.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique is related to initial access, which involves gaining access to the victim's system.
   - T1596.002-WHOIS: This technique is also related to reconnaissance, specifically gathering information about domain registration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, which aligns with T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the victim, which aligns with T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information.
   - The question specifically asks about registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services, which aligns with T1596.002-WHOIS.

Given the sequence of events, it is likely that ProjectM actors would gather victim identity information after gaining initial access, which would be followed by gathering more information about the victim, including potentially registering domains to gather more information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
2. After gaining initial access, the actors would likely gather more information about the victim (T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information).
3. As part of this reconnaissance, they might register domains to gather more information about the victim, which could involve using WHOIS protection services (T1596.002-WHOIS).

**Final Answer: A**
