Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of activities involving reconnaissance, specifically gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. It then asks if malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.
2. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about system network connections, which is also related to reconnaissance.
3. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks: This TTP involves monitoring user activity to gather information, which could be used for reconnaissance or to identify potential entry points.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it seems that the initial activities involve reconnaissance to gather information about the target system or network. The question asks if the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network. This implies that the implant needs to establish a connection to receive further instructions or to report back to the attackers.

Considering the TTPs, it is likely that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after the reconnaissance activities, as this would be a natural progression of the attack sequence. The employee-enabled macro execution is a method of initial infection, but it is not a communication method with C2 servers.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed on the network.

Final Answer: B
