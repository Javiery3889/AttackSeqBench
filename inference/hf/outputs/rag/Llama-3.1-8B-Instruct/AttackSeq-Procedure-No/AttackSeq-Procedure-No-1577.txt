To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks if Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing before using specific tools to discover machines in the compromised network. This implies a sequence of actions: initial compromise, lateral movement, and discovery.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This TTP involves using remote services to discover systems on a network.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery: This TTP involves discovering network services to identify potential entry points.
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This TTP involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: initial compromise (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but implied), lateral movement, and discovery.
   - The related TTPs provide insight into the discovery phase, which is part of the sequence.
   - The question mentions exploiting remote services as part of lateral movement, which aligns with Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - The question also mentions using internal spear phishing, which is not directly related to the provided TTPs but is a common tactic used for initial compromise.

Considering the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:
   - Initial compromise (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs)
   - Lateral movement by exploiting remote services (Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services)
   - Discovery of machines in the compromised network using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan (Tactic: Discovery, Techniques: T1018-Remote System Discovery and T1046-Network Service Discovery)

Given this analysis, the answer is affirmative, as the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the related TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
