Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attacker using a custom base64 alphabet to communicate with C2 servers and then asks if the TDrop2 malware will likely perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding (standard encoding methods)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding (non-standard encoding methods)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery (collecting system and network information)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The question describes the use of a custom base64 alphabet for communication with C2 servers, which falls under non-standard encoding methods (T1132.002). This suggests that the attacker is using a non-standard method to communicate with the C2 server, which is a common tactic for avoiding detection. Given this, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information (T1082) after establishing communication with the C2 server.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker is using a custom base64 alphabet for communication with C2 servers, which is a non-standard encoding method (T1132.002).
2. Non-standard encoding methods are often used to avoid detection and establish a secure communication channel.
3. After establishing a secure communication channel, the attacker is likely to perform discovery activities to gather more information about the system and network.
4. The discovery activity (T1082) is a common step in the attack chain after establishing communication with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
