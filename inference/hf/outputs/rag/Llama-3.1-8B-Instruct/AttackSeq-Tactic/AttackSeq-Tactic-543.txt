Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker gains initial access through a phishing email containing a malicious XLS file. The attacker then uses an MSI package to install a malicious Lua script and establishes autorun via an LNK file to gain persistence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to the Execution tactic, specifically T1204.002-Malicious File. This technique involves the use of malicious files to execute malicious code.

Comparison and Evaluation:
To determine the most likely tactic that occurred before the attackers gained persistence, we need to consider the sequence of events described in the question.

1. The attackers gained initial access through a phishing email containing a malicious XLS file. This suggests that the initial access was achieved through a social engineering tactic, but the specific tactic is not directly related to the provided TTPs.
2. The attackers then used an MSI package to install a malicious Lua script and established autorun via an LNK file to gain persistence. This indicates that the malicious file was executed, which aligns with the related TTPs.

Considering the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the attackers gained persistence is the execution of the malicious file. This is because the execution of the malicious file (T1204.002-Malicious File) is a necessary step before the attackers can install the Lua script and establish autorun via the LNK file.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access was gained through a phishing email containing a malicious XLS file.
2. The malicious XLS file was executed, which is related to the Execution tactic.
3. The execution of the malicious file allowed the attackers to install a malicious Lua script and establish autorun via an LNK file, which is a persistence mechanism.

Final Answer: D: Execution
