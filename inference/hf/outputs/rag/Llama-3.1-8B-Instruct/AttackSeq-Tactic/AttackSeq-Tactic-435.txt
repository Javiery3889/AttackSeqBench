Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where an obfuscated VBScript (VBS) named 'PlayList.vbs' is executed using 'wscript.exe' and then communicates with a C2 server. However, before the communication with the C2 server, the VBS script is deleted. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to delete the VBS script and evade detection.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004 - File Deletion
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic

The first TTP (T1070.004 - File Deletion) directly relates to deleting files to evade detection, which aligns with the action described in the question. The second TTP (T1059.005 - Visual Basic) is related to the execution of Visual Basic scripts, which is also relevant to the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the related TTPs, the most relevant tactic to the action of deleting the VBS script to evade detection is Defense Evasion. This tactic is directly related to techniques used to evade detection by an adversary, such as deleting files.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of events involving the execution of an obfuscated VBS script.
2. The script is executed using 'wscript.exe' and communicates with a C2 server.
3. Before the communication with the C2 server, the VBS script is deleted.
4. The related TTPs indicate that the deletion of the VBS script is a technique used for Defense Evasion.
5. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred to delete the VBS script and evade detection is Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: B
