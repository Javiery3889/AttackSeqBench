To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where an initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks. The attackers then managed three separate campaigns with different C&C (Command and Control) IPs to maintain control over their victims. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

   These TTPs indicate that the attackers used phishing and spear-phishing tactics to gain initial access to the victims. However, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after the initial access was gained.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: Exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network. This does not align with the scenario described, as the question mentions maintaining control over victims, not transferring data.
   - **B: Initial Access**: Initial Access is the tactic used to gain access to a system or network, which is already described in the question as spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target before an attack. This does not align with the scenario described, as the question mentions maintaining control over victims, not gathering information.
   - **D: Command and Control**: Command and Control (C2) refers to the communication between an attacker and their compromised systems. This aligns with the scenario described, as the attackers managed three separate campaigns with different C&C IPs to maintain control over their victims.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks (T1566-Phishing and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link), and then established Command and Control (C2) to maintain control over their victims.

Final Answer: D
