To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions involving a Mattermost server, where the attacker interacts with the server to collect and communicate system information and then communicates system details and screenshots to the same server. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after interacting with the Mattermost server to collect and communicate system information and before communicating system details and screenshots to the same server.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

Based on the related TTPs, we can see that T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique under the Exfiltration tactic, which involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique under the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering system information.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the attacker first interacts with the Mattermost server to collect and communicate system information. This action aligns with the Discovery tactic, as the attacker is gathering system information. The next action is communicating system details and screenshots to the same server, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic, as the attacker is exfiltrating data over a C2 channel (the Mattermost server).

Considering the sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery) followed by Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The attacker interacts with the Mattermost server to collect and communicate system information, which aligns with the Discovery tactic (T1082-System Information Discovery).
2. The next action is communicating system details and screenshots to the same server, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
