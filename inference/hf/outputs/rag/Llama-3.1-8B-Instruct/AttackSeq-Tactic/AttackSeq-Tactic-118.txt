Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events involving malicious emails, trojaned attachments, and the execution of the 'Surtr' malware through process injection. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the malicious emails were sent and before the malware execution.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves delivering malware through malicious files, which aligns with the trojaned attachments in the question.
- T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is the method used to execute the 'Surtr' malware.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Resource Development: This tactic involves creating or modifying resources, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- B: Execution: This tactic involves loading, running, or causing code to be executed, which aligns with the execution of the 'Surtr' malware through process injection.
- C: Impact: This tactic involves causing a direct impact on the target, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- D: Initial Access: This tactic involves gaining access to a target, which occurred before the events described in the question (the malicious emails were sent).

Based on the related TTPs and the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the malicious emails were sent and before the malware execution is the execution of the malware through process injection.

Final Answer: B
