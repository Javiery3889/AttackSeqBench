Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where attackers compromised Avast's download servers and embedded a malicious binary in software accessed by users. The malicious binary is CCleaner 5.33, which was altered to initiate execution of its altered flow to decrypt and deploy a malware payload.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary: This TTP is related to compromising software binaries to maintain persistence on a system.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads: This TTP is related to embedding malicious payloads within legitimate software to evade detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks about the tactic that enabled the attackers to compromise Avast's download servers and embed the malicious binary in software accessed by users. 
- The TTPs provided suggest that the attackers compromised a software binary (CCleaner 5.33) and embedded a malicious payload within it.
- The correct answer should be the tactic that aligns with the initial compromise of the software binary and the embedding of the malicious payload.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers compromised Avast's download servers, which suggests an initial compromise of a system or service.
2. The compromised software binary (CCleaner 5.33) was altered to initiate execution of its altered flow to decrypt and deploy a malware payload.
3. The TTPs provided suggest that the attackers compromised a software binary and embedded a malicious payload within it.
4. Based on the above analysis, the initial compromise of the software binary and the embedding of the malicious payload suggest that the attackers used the Initial Access tactic to gain access to the system or service (Avast's download servers) and then used Defense Evasion (Embedded Payloads) to evade detection by embedding the malicious payload within the software binary.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
