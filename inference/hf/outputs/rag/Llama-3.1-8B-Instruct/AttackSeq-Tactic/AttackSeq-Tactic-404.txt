To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware: 
     1. UAC bypass using a .NET technique to evade detection.
     2. Collection of basic system information, such as IP address and hostname.
     3. Searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control (UAC bypass)
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (not directly relevant to the question)
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery (collection of system information)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: evasion, collection of system information, and searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
   - The evasion action is related to Defense Evasion (Tactic: B).
   - The collection of system information is related to Discovery (Tactic: D).
   - The searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses is likely related to Command and Control (C2) as it implies the malware is trying to establish communication with a command and control server to send or receive information.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence is:
   - Evasion (Defense Evasion) -> Collection of system information (Discovery) -> Searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses (Command and Control)

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** the evasion and **before** the collection of system information. Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that is most closely related to the evasion action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The evasion action is related to Defense Evasion (Tactic: B).
   - The collection of system information is related to Discovery (Tactic: D).
   - The searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses is likely related to Command and Control (C2).
   - The correct sequence is Evasion -> Collection of system information -> Searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred after evasion and before collection of system information is Discovery.

Final Answer: D
