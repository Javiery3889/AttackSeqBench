To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of events where employees were socially engineered to enable macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware. After the malware installation, the adversaries used BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This TTP is related to the adversaries using BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service: This TTP is related to the initial social engineering of employees to enable macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This TTP is also related to the initial social engineering of employees to enable macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that facilitated communication between the malware and an external server. This implies a command and control (C2) channel.
   - The TTPs provided are related to the initial access and lateral movement phases of the attack. However, the question specifically asks about communication between the malware and an external server, which is a characteristic of a C2 channel.
   - Based on the ATT&CK framework, Command and Control (A) is the tactic that involves establishing a communication channel between the malware and an external server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the adversaries installed BlackEnergy 3 malware and then used it for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - The Related TTPs provided are related to the initial access and lateral movement phases of the attack.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that facilitated communication between the malware and an external server, which is a characteristic of a C2 channel.
   - Based on the ATT&CK framework, Command and Control (A) is the tactic that involves establishing a communication channel between the malware and an external server.

Final Answer: A
