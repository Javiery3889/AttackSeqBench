To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of tactics leading up to the SBDH malware contacting a remote server to download its backdoor and data stealer components. This implies that the malware has already been deployed and is now seeking to enhance its capabilities.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging: This technique involves staging data in a remote location, which could be a precursor to the malware downloading additional components.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer: This technique involves transferring data from the compromised system to a remote location, which could be a result of the malware's enhanced capabilities.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data through a command and control (C2) channel, which could be used by the malware to send stolen data back to its operators.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: Execution - This tactic would occur after the malware has been deployed and is executing its payload, which doesn't directly relate to the malware downloading additional components.
B: Command and Control - This tactic involves the communication between the malware and its C2 server, but it doesn't directly relate to the malware downloading additional components.
C: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves the malware moving laterally within the network, which is not directly related to the malware downloading additional components.
D: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial compromise of the system, which is the most likely precursor to the malware downloading additional components.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question asks about the sequence of tactics leading up to the malware downloading additional components.
2. The related TTPs include Remote Data Staging, which implies that the malware is preparing to download additional components.
3. Initial Access is the most likely precursor to the malware downloading additional components, as it involves the initial compromise of the system.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
