Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where attackers used initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using an Explosive Trojan. This indicates a movement of the attackers within the network, rather than an initial entry or control phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are all related to Lateral Movement. T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares and T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer are both techniques used for moving within a network, while T1091-Replication Through Removable Media is a technique for initial access, which is not relevant to the scenario described.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the attackers moving laterally within the network. The Explosive Trojan is used to spread manually across the network, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers initially infected servers, which is not the focus of the question.
2. The attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread across the network, indicating movement within the network.
3. The Explosive Trojan was used for this spread, which is a technique for lateral movement.
4. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: B
