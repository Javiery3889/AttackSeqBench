Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Russian-speaking cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems of a targeted organization. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before this action.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Credential Access (Tactic): This tactic involves obtaining valid accounts and credentials to access a system or network.
- Brute Force (T1110): This technique involves attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system by trying multiple combinations of usernames and passwords.
- Reconnaissance (Tactic): This tactic involves gathering information about a target system or network to inform an attack.
- Credentials (T1589.001): This technique involves gathering information about user credentials, such as usernames and passwords.
- Collection (Tactic): This tactic involves gathering information about a target system or network.
- Email Forwarding Rule (T1114.003): This technique involves setting up a rule to forward emails to a different address, often used for phishing or other malicious purposes.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, the most likely tactic that occurred before the cybercriminals used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems is Reconnaissance. This is because reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target system or network, which would be necessary to identify potential vulnerabilities and determine the best approach to gain access.

The Brute Force technique (T1110) is a method of gaining unauthorized access, but it is a technique under the Credential Access tactic, not a tactic itself. The other options, Impact, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration, do not align with the scenario described in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the cybercriminals first conducted reconnaissance to gather information about the target system or network, which would have included gathering information about user credentials (T1589.001-Credentials). This information would have been used to inform their approach to gaining access, which ultimately involved using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems.

Final Answer: C
