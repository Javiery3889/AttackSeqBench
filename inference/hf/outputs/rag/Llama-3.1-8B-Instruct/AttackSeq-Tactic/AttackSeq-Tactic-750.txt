Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of backdoors, malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, and the search for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during this sequence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a system.
- T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros in Microsoft Office documents to execute malicious code.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system's files and directories to identify potential targets.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The initial access was gained through spearphishing attachments (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
- The malicious macros in Word and Excel documents were used for execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
- The search for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives suggests that the attacker is gathering information about the system's files and directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).

Based on the sequence of events, the most likely tactic that occurred after employing backdoors and leveraging malicious macros is the collection of sensitive information. This is because the attacker is searching for sensitive documents, which aligns with the goal of gathering information about the system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker gained initial access through spearphishing attachments (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. The attacker used malicious macros in Word and Excel documents to execute code (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
3. The attacker searched for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives, which is a form of information gathering (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).

Final Answer: B
