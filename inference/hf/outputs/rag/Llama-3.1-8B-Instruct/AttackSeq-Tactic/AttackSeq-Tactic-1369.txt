Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, such as BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK, to establish a foothold in victim networks. This indicates that the attackers have successfully gained initial access to the network.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell: This TTP is related to maintaining access to a system by using a web shell. However, it is more about maintaining access rather than gaining it.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services: This TTP is related to gaining access to a network through external remote services.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question describes the exploitation of external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, which is a method of gaining initial access to a network. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after this is not Persistence, as the attackers have not yet maintained access. 
- Execution (B) is also not the correct answer because the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access, not the action of executing malware.
- Credential Access (D) is also not the correct answer because the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access, not the action of accessing credentials.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used External Remote Services (T1133) to gain initial access to the network, and then deployed web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold. This is a common sequence of events in an attack, where the attackers first gain access and then establish persistence.

Final Answer: D
