To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking in a legitimate application, and the attackers stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the DLL hijacking and before the credential theft.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking (DLL hijacking)
2. Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking (DLL hijacking)
3. Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking (DLL hijacking)

These TTPs all involve DLL hijacking, which is the initial action taken by the attackers.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we know that DLL hijacking is the initial action. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after DLL hijacking and before credential theft. 

- **Initial Access** (A) is the initial step in the attack, which is already completed with DLL hijacking.
- **Persistence** (B) is a plausible choice, as DLL hijacking can be used to maintain persistence on the system. This tactic would occur after the initial DLL hijacking and before the attackers steal credentials to maintain their presence on the system.
- **Credential Access** (C) is the tactic that occurred after the DLL hijacking, as it is the action of stealing domain authentication credentials.
- **Execution** (D) is not directly related to the DLL hijacking and credential theft sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. DLL hijacking occurred via T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking.
2. The next step would be to maintain the presence on the system, which is **Persistence**.
3. After maintaining persistence, the attackers stole domain authentication credentials, which is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: B**
