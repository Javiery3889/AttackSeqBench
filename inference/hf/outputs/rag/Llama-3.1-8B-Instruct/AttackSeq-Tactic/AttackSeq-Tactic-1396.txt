To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT10 deployed malware for long-term remote access and performed internal reconnaissance.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs include:
        - Lateral Movement (Tactic): This tactic involves the adversary moving within the network after initial access has been gained.
        - Execution (Tactic): This tactic involves the adversary executing code to achieve a specific goal.
        - T1080-Taint Shared Content: This technique involves the adversary using shared content to spread malware.
        - T1053.002-At: This technique involves the adversary using a remote access tool (RAT) to execute code.
        - Persistence (Tactic): This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the system or network over time.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the adversary used a RAT (Remote Access Tool) to execute code (T1053.002-At) and performed lateral movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content) to spread the malware.
    - The question mentions the deployment of malware for long-term remote access, which aligns with the use of a RAT.
    - The question also mentions internal reconnaissance to establish a foothold on the network, which aligns with the lateral movement tactic.

4.  Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the deployment of malware and internal reconnaissance.
    - Based on the related TTPs, the use of a RAT (T1053.002-At) and lateral movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content) occurred before the deployment of malware and internal reconnaissance.
    - Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the deployment of malware and internal reconnaissance is Execution.

5.  Final Answer:
    - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred before the deployment of malware and internal reconnaissance.
    - Final Answer: A
