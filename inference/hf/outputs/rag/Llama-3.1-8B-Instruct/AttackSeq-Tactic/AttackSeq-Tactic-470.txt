Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects were used to target high-ranking diplomats and academic researchers. This suggests a targeted attack aimed at gaining access to sensitive information or systems.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1589.002-Email Addresses: This technique involves gathering email addresses for targeting purposes, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- B: Reconnaissance: This tactic involves gathering information about a target, which aligns with the initial step of gathering email addresses (T1589.002) for targeting purposes.
- A: Defense Evasion: This tactic involves evading detection by security software, which is not directly related to the scenario described.
- C: Execution: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which would occur after initial access has been gained.
- D: Initial Access: This tactic involves gaining access to a system or network, which aligns with the use of spear phishing emails with attachments (T1566.001) to gain initial access.

Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events is reconnaissance (gathering email addresses) followed by initial access (using spear phishing emails with attachments). Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects were used to target high-ranking diplomats and academic researchers is Initial Access.

Final Answer: D
