To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where privilege escalation is achieved through a 'fileless' UAC bypass and code is injected into Notepad.exe. The question asks for the next likely ATT&CK tactic involving techniques such as process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process to bypass detection.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012 - Process Hollowing
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012 - Process Hollowing

Process hollowing is a technique used for Defense Evasion, where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process, making it difficult to detect. This technique is often used in conjunction with privilege escalation to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Collection - This tactic is not directly related to the scenario described in the question, which focuses on evasion and privilege escalation.

B: Privilege Escalation - While privilege escalation is mentioned in the question, the question asks for the next likely tactic, not the current one.

C: Command and Control - This tactic is not directly related to the scenario described in the question, which focuses on evasion and privilege escalation.

D: Defense Evasion - This tactic aligns with the related TTPs, specifically process hollowing, which is used to bypass detection. Given that the code is injected into a suspended process, it is likely that the attacker is attempting to evade detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a scenario where privilege escalation is achieved through a 'fileless' UAC bypass and code is injected into Notepad.exe.
2. The related TTPs mention process hollowing, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion.
3. The question asks for the next likely ATT&CK tactic involving techniques such as process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process to bypass detection.
4. Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described in the question, Defense Evasion is the most plausible next tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
