To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes Stuxnet employing rootkit functionality and using stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers for evasion. It also mentions exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (This TTP is related to spreading across networked systems)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing (This TTP is related to using stolen digital certificates to sign malicious code)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit (This TTP is related to hiding the presence of malware)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the use of rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates for evasion, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic. 
   - The question also mentions exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred while exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems. This is a key point, as it indicates the action of spreading across networked systems is the primary focus.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the use of rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates for evasion, which is a Defense Evasion tactic.
   - However, the primary action described in the question is the exploitation of vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems, which is a Lateral Movement tactic.
   - Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred while exploiting the vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems, the correct answer is the tactic that aligns with this action.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to Lateral Movement, as it aligns with the action of spreading across networked systems while exploiting vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: C
