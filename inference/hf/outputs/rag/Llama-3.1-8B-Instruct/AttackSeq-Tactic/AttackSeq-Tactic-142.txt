Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor, FamousSparrow, involving SparrowDoor. The sequence includes probing files in specified directories during the Discovery phase and communicating with a C&C server over HTTPS as part of Command and Control activities. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the Discovery phase but before the Command and Control phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs include techniques from the Command and Control (Tactic) and Discovery (Tactic) categories. Specifically, the techniques mentioned are:
  - T1071.001-Web Protocols (Command and Control): This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
  - T1083-File and Directory Discovery (Discovery): This technique involves discovering files and directories on a system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the Discovery phase but before the Command and Control phase. 
- The Discovery phase involves probing files in specified directories (T1083-File and Directory Discovery).
- The Command and Control phase involves communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
- Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after Discovery but before Command and Control, we need to find a tactic that logically fits between these two phases.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Discovery phase (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) is the initial phase where the threat actor probes files in specified directories.
2. The Command and Control phase (T1071.001-Web Protocols) involves communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS, which is the final phase in the sequence.
3. The tactic that logically fits between these two phases is Collection, as it involves gathering information or data from the system, which is a natural progression from Discovery and before the Command and Control phase where the data is sent to the C&C server.

Final Answer: C
