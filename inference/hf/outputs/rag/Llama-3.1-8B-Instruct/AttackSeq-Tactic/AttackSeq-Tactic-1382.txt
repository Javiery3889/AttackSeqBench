Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor TeamTNT. They downloaded and executed a coin miner payload, and then tracked infected hosts using iplogger.org. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the execution of the coin miner payload but before tracking infected hosts.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

These TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, which involve the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. T1102-Web Service and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer are both techniques used for C2, but they occur at different stages of the attack.

T1102-Web Service involves using a web service to establish a C2 channel, which could be used for various purposes, including downloading additional tools or payloads. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer involves transferring tools or payloads into a compromised system, which could be used for further exploitation.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, we need to determine which C2 tactic occurred after the execution of the coin miner payload but before tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.

- Execution (A) is the action of running the coin miner payload, which has already occurred.
- Discovery (B) is not directly related to the C2 tactics described in the related TTPs.
- Command and Control (C) is the most likely answer, as it involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which would be necessary for the attacker to track infected hosts using iplogger.org.
- Exfiltration (D) is the process of extracting data from a compromised system, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of actions taken by TeamTNT.
2. The related TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) tactics.
3. The C2 tactics involve communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
4. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the execution of the coin miner payload but before tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.
5. Based on the related TTPs, the most likely C2 tactic that occurred after the execution of the coin miner payload is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
