To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving Gamaredon, a group known for their tactics. The sequence involves exfiltration of documents to a C&C server and the use of both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This indicates the use of web protocols for C2 communication.
     - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This indicates the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the use of both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic using web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
   - The question also mentions exfiltration of documents to the C&C server, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
   - However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the exfiltration and after the use of web protocols for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of web protocols for C2 communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a prerequisite for exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).
   - Therefore, the Command and Control tactic must have occurred before the exfiltration.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the Command and Control tactic is the most likely to have occurred before the exfiltration of harvested documents to the C&C server and after the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

Final Answer: C
