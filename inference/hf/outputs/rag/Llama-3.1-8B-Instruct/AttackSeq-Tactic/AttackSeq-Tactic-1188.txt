To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by SUNSPOT, which includes:
1. Employing AES128-CBC encryption to protect targeted source code files and the backdoored source code file in the binary.
2. Monitoring running processes for MsBuild.exe to detect targeted build environments.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to Defense Evasion, which is a tactic used to evade detection by security controls. The specific techniques mentioned are:
- T1027.004: Compile After Delivery (a technique used to evade detection by compiling malware after it has been delivered to the victim's system)
- T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File (a technique used to evade detection by encrypting or encoding files)
- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information (a technique used to evade detection by obfuscating files or information)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that all of them are related to Defense Evasion. The question describes two actions taken by SUNSPOT: encrypting files and monitoring processes. The encryption of files is most closely related to T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion.

The monitoring of processes for MsBuild.exe is likely a precursor to the encryption of files, as it suggests that SUNSPOT is trying to identify and target specific build environments. This is most closely related to T1027.004: Compile After Delivery, which involves compiling malware after it has been delivered to the victim's system.

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the encryption, and the monitoring of processes for MsBuild.exe is more closely related to the compilation of malware after delivery.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. SUNSPOT monitors running processes for MsBuild.exe to detect targeted build environments (T1027.004: Compile After Delivery).
2. SUNSPOT employs AES128-CBC encryption to protect targeted source code files and the backdoored source code file in the binary (T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File).

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
