To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a multi-stage process involving the deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts to avoid detection by antivirus or endpoint security. This implies that the attacker is trying to execute malicious code on the system without being detected.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion (exploiting vulnerabilities to evade detection)
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell (using PowerShell to execute malicious code)
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.010-Command Obfuscation (obfuscating commands to evade detection)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the question describes a process of deploying GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts, which aligns with the techniques of Defense Evasion (T1211 and T1027.010) and Execution (T1059.001). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR.

Considering the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after deploying GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts would be to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel to communicate with the backdoor. This is because the backdoor is deployed, and the attacker needs to control it to execute further malicious activities.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker deploys GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts to evade detection.
2. The next logical step is to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel to communicate with the backdoor.
3. This C2 channel would allow the attacker to execute further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
