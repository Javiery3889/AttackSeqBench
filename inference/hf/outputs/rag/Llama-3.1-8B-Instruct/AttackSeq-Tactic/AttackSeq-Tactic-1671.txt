To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined above.

**Step 1: Analyze the Question**
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involved understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets before DNSpionage gained initial access through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.

**Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs**
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (general phishing)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear-phishing link)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (spear-phishing attachment)

These TTPs are related to the initial access tactic, specifically focusing on phishing techniques.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a tactic that occurred before the initial access through spear-phishing. The question mentions understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets, which suggests a reconnaissance activity.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning**
- The question specifies that the activity occurred before the initial access through spear-phishing, which means it cannot be a part of the initial access tactic.
- The question mentions understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets, which is a characteristic of reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance is a tactic that involves gathering information about a target before launching an attack, which aligns with the described activity.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
