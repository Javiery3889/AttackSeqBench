To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of tactics in an attack, specifically which tactic occurred before FIN13 employed JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy (network traffic proxying)
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery (network mapping)
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials (acquiring credentials)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions FIN13 employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying, which falls under Command and Control (Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy).
   - The question asks what tactic occurred before this action.
   - The related TTPs include network mapping (T1046-Network Service Discovery) and acquiring credentials (T1589.001-Credentials), which are both part of the Reconnaissance tactic.
   - Lateral Movement (A) is not directly related to the given TTPs.
   - Resource Development (B) is not directly related to the given TTPs.
   - Initial Access (C) is not directly related to the given TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions FIN13 employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying, which is a Command and Control tactic.
   - The related TTPs include network mapping and acquiring credentials, which are part of the Reconnaissance tactic.
   - Since Reconnaissance is the broader category that includes both network mapping and acquiring credentials, it is the most likely tactic to have occurred before the Command and Control tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Reconnaissance occurred before Command and Control.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Reconnaissance.
