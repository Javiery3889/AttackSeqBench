Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway. This means we are looking for the tactic that precedes the exploitation of external servers and the deployment of web shells.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell (deployment of web shells as a gateway)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services (exploitation of external servers)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the exploitation of external servers (T1133-External Remote Services) is the initial step that allows FIN13 to gain access to the victim's network. The deployment of web shells (T1505.003-Web Shell) is a subsequent step that enables persistence and potentially further exploitation.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: Reconnaissance is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers or the deployment of web shells.
- B: Defense Evasion is not relevant to the initial steps of gaining access to the network.
- C: Lateral Movement implies movement within the network, which is not the initial step in this scenario.
- D: Initial Access is the most plausible answer, as it directly relates to the exploitation of external servers (T1133-External Remote Services) that precedes the deployment of web shells.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that FIN13 exploited external servers (Initial Access) to gain access to the victim's network, and then deployed web shells as a gateway for persistence.

Final Answer: D
