Analysis of the Question:
The question describes the Darkhotel APT gaining initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates for hotel guests. It asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

These TTPs indicate that the attackers used techniques to evade detection and compromise the software supply chain to gain initial access. The technique T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location suggests that the attackers used legitimate names or locations to evade detection, which could be related to gathering information about the victims.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A: Resource Development is not directly related to gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
- Option B: Reconnaissance is a tactic that involves gathering information about a target, which aligns with the technique T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location.
- Option C: Initial Access is the tactic used by the attackers to gain access, but it does not specifically involve gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
- Option D: Command and Control is a tactic used after initial access has been gained, which is not relevant to the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used techniques to evade detection and gather information about the victims.
3. Option B: Reconnaissance is the tactic that aligns with gathering information about the victims.

Final Answer: B
