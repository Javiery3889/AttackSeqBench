To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack scenario where an attacker has already obtained domain administrator privileges using tools like Mimikatz.
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when the attacker used PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts (obtaining domain administrator privileges)
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts (obtaining domain administrator privileges)
     - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool (creating or acquiring tools like PsExec and WinExe)
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker has already gained initial access and escalated privileges, and now they are using tools to spread across the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network over time. While the attacker may be trying to maintain access, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred when the attacker spread across the compromised network using PsExec and WinExe.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to a system or network. The attacker has already gained initial access, as indicated by the related TTPs.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic is about increasing privileges on a system. The attacker has already escalated privileges, as indicated by the related TTPs.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving within a network after initial access has been gained. The use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across the compromised network suggests that the attacker is moving laterally within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attacker has already obtained domain administrator privileges and is now using tools to spread across the network.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already gained initial access and escalated privileges.
   - The use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across the network suggests lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is lateral movement.

Final Answer: D
