To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Korplug variant collects system information, including system details and metadata from network shared drives. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The provided TTPs are related to Discovery tactics. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1082-System Information Discovery are both part of the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the target system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This is the current action described in the question, so it's unlikely to be the next step.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within the network to reach other systems. While it's possible, it doesn't directly follow the collection of system information.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker's command and control (C2) server. It's a plausible next step after collecting system information to potentially send the collected data to the C2 server.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data out of the network. While it's a possible next step, it's less likely than establishing a C2 channel to send the collected data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: Based on the provided TTPs and the scenario, the most plausible next step after collecting system information is to establish a communication channel to send the collected data to the attacker's C2 server. This is a common pattern in many attacks, where the attacker collects information and then sends it back to their C2 server for further analysis or use.

Final Answer: C
