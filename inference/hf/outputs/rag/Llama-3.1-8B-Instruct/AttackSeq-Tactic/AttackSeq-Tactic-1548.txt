Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers, including using anti-analysis techniques, gathering data on the victim's computer, and utilizing a backdoor to collect extensive system data. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the attackers gathered data on the victim's computer but before they used the backdoor to collect more system data.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery: This technique involves discovering the presence of security software on the system.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering system information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attackers first used anti-analysis techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, including kernel information and anti-virus presence (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery). Then, they likely gathered more system information (T1082-System Information Discovery) before utilizing the backdoor to collect extensive system data (T1005-Data from Local System).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery)
2. Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery)
3. Collection (T1005-Data from Local System)

The final step of collecting extensive system data like file and process information is part of the Collection tactic, which is the correct answer.

Final Answer: D
