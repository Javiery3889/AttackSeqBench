To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding after BlueBravo's malware gathered system information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This technique involves encoding data using standard encoding schemes like Base64.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding. This suggests that the communication is being encoded and encrypted to evade detection.
   - Based on the related TTPs, the most relevant technique is T1132.001-Standard Encoding, which involves encoding data using standard encoding schemes like Base64.
   - However, the question also mentions HTTPS communication, which implies a Command and Control (C2) channel. Therefore, the most likely tactic is Command and Control, as it involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - BlueBravo's malware gathered system information, which is a precursor to establishing a Command and Control channel.
   - To enable HTTPS communication, the attacker would need to encode the data using a standard encoding scheme like Base64 (T1132.001-Standard Encoding).
   - This encoding would allow the attacker to establish a secure communication channel with the compromised system.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to Command and Control, which involves establishing a secure communication channel using standard encoding schemes like Base64.

Final Answer: D
