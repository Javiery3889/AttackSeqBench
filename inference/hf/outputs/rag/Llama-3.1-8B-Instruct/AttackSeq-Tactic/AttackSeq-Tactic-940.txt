To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by a backdoor: loading an encrypted configuration file, decrypting it, and using the SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers. This sequence suggests that the backdoor is communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003 - Protocol or Service Impersonation: This TTP is related to the backdoor's communication with the C2 server, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File: This TTP is related to the encryption of the configuration file, which is part of the sequence described in the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: Command and Control - This tactic is related to the backdoor's communication with the C2 server, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
B: Defense Evasion - This tactic is related to the encryption of the configuration file, which is part of the sequence described in the question. This makes it a strong candidate for the correct answer.
C: Execution - This tactic is related to the execution of the backdoor, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
D: Persistence - This tactic is related to the persistence of the backdoor on the system, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The backdoor loaded an encrypted configuration file, which suggests that the file was encrypted to evade detection.
2. The backdoor decrypted the configuration file, which implies that the encryption was used for defense evasion.
3. The backdoor used the SSL protocol to connect to C2 servers, which is a common method for Command and Control communication.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor used Defense Evasion (T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File) to load the encrypted configuration file, and then executed the sequence of actions to connect to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B**
