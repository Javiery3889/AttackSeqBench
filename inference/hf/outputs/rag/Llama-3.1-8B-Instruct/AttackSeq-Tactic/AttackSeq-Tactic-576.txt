Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving a Disttrack dropper, which is a type of malware. The dropper installs a communications and wiper module, attempts to spread to other systems, and then renders the system unusable by overwriting its MBR (Master Boot Record) and files. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the communications and wiper module was installed but before the system was rendered unusable.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- T1485-Data Destruction: This technique involves deleting or overwriting data to make it unrecoverable.
- T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe: This technique involves overwriting the MBR, which is a critical component of a disk's structure.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the system was rendered unusable by overwriting its MBR and files, which aligns with the Data Destruction and Disk Structure Wipe techniques. These techniques are part of the Impact tactic, which involves disrupting or destroying data, systems, or infrastructure.

Considering the sequence of events, the tactic that occurred after the communications and wiper module was installed but before the system was rendered unusable would likely be related to the spread of the malware to other systems. This is because the system was still operational enough to attempt to spread the malware before it was rendered unusable.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. The Disttrack dropper installed a communications and wiper module.
2. The system attempted to spread the malware to other systems on the network (Discovery is not the correct answer because it involves gathering information about the target, which is not the focus here).
3. The system was rendered unusable by overwriting its MBR and files (Impact).

The tactic that occurred after the communications and wiper module was installed but before the system was rendered unusable is likely related to the spread of the malware, which is not explicitly listed in the answer choices. However, the closest answer choice that aligns with the spread of the malware is Command and Control, as it involves the communication between the malware and its command and control server, which is necessary for the malware to spread to other systems.

Final Answer: D
