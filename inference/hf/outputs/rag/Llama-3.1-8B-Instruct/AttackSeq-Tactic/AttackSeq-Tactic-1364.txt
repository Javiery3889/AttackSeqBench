To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the sequence of tactics after attackers gained initial access through malicious RTF files and before the malware employed obfuscation to evade detection. This implies a sequence of events where the attackers have already compromised the system and are now taking steps to maintain their presence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves the use of malicious files to gain initial access to a system.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves the use of obfuscation to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the attackers gained initial access through malicious RTF files (T1204.002-Malicious File), which is the first step in the sequence.
   - The next step in the sequence is before the malware employed obfuscation to evade detection (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information), which implies that the attackers need to perform some action before they can use obfuscation.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial access and before the obfuscation, which means we are looking for a tactic that is likely to occur after the initial access and before the evasive action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access was gained through malicious RTF files (T1204.002-Malicious File).
   - After gaining access, the attackers would likely execute the malicious file to achieve their objectives (T1204.002-Malicious File is a technique under the Execution tactic).
   - After executing the malicious file, the attackers would then employ obfuscation to evade detection (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information).

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of tactics is Execution, as it is the most likely action to occur after the initial access and before the evasive action.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
