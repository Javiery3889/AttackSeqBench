To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where APT3 and APT18 used phishing campaigns to exploit a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT payloads. The payloads were used to establish communication with hardcoded CnC addresses. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this sequence of events.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation (This TTP is related to the impact of the attack, but it's not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (This TTP is related to spearphishing via links, which is not directly related to the question.)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (This TTP is related to spearphishing via attachments, which is relevant to the question as it describes the initial access method used by APT3 and APT18.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing attachments (T1566.001). The question asks for the tactic that occurred after this initial access. The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

1. Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)
2. Command and Control (to establish communication with hardcoded CnC addresses)

The Command and Control tactic would be the most likely next step after initial access, as it involves establishing communication with the attackers' command and control infrastructure.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. APT3 and APT18 used spearphishing attachments to gain initial access (T1566.001).
2. After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to establish communication with their CnC infrastructure to deliver the SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT payloads.
3. The most plausible tactic that occurred after initial access is Command and Control, as it involves establishing communication with the attackers' CnC addresses.

**Final Answer: A**
