Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has already established initial access through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Sednit's Delphi downloader sent gathered information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs include:
  - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This indicates the initial access was gained through a spearphishing email attachment.
  - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This suggests the use of PowerShell for execution.
  - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic: This indicates the use of Visual Basic (VBA) macros for execution.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question mentions that initial access was already established through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros. This aligns with the related TTP T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
- The question then asks for the tactic that occurred before the Sednit's Delphi downloader sent gathered information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`. This action is an example of Command and Control (C2) communication, which is typically associated with the Execution tactic.
- Given that the attacker has already established initial access and is now engaging in C2 communication, the most likely tactic that occurred before this action is also Execution, as it involves the execution of the Sednit's Delphi downloader and the subsequent C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access was gained through a spearphishing email attachment containing malicious VBA macros (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. The attacker then executed the malicious VBA macros (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
3. The execution of the malicious VBA macros likely led to the execution of the Sednit's Delphi downloader (T1059.001-PowerShell).
4. The Sednit's Delphi downloader sent gathered information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`, which is an example of C2 communication (Execution).

Final Answer: C
