To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of events where attackers initially gained access to the bank's network through phishing emails and created backdoors. Then, they leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement and compromised the Enterprise Admin account.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access to a network.
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This technique involves using spearphishing to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing certain actions within the network.
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that the attackers initially gained access through phishing emails and created backdoors, which is a form of Initial Access (Tactic).
   - The question then mentions that the attackers leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement and compromised the Enterprise Admin account. This implies that the attackers used the initial access to move laterally within the network.
   - The related TTPs mention T1534-Internal Spearphishing, which is a technique used for lateral movement.

Considering the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the attackers using the initial access (phishing emails and backdoors) to move laterally within the network using internal spearphishing (T1534-Internal Spearphishing).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The attackers gained initial access through phishing emails and created backdoors (Initial Access).
- They then used this initial access to move laterally within the network using internal spearphishing (Lateral Movement).
- Finally, they compromised the Enterprise Admin account, which is likely a result of the lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
