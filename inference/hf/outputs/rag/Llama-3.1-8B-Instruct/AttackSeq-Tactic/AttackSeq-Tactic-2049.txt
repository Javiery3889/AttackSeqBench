Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where an iOS malware is installed on compromised systems and then starts gathering sensitive information. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the malware installation but before the data collection.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs include:
  - Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal): This technique involves removing or modifying indicators of malicious activity to evade detection.
  - Collection (T1005-Data from Local System): This technique involves gathering data from the compromised system.
  - Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery): This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as its configuration and installed software.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the malware installation but before data collection. 
- Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal) is a tactic that can occur before data collection, as it involves removing indicators of malicious activity to avoid detection.
- Collection (T1005-Data from Local System) is the tactic that occurs after the malware starts gathering information, which is not what we are looking for.
- Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery) is a tactic that can occur before data collection, as it involves gathering information about the system.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware installed on the system (Execution) and then Defense Evasion (T1070-Indicator Removal) occurred to remove indicators of malicious activity before the malware started gathering information (Collection).

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the malware installation but before data collection. Therefore, the correct answer is not Execution, but rather the tactic that occurred before data collection.

Final Answer: D: Discovery
