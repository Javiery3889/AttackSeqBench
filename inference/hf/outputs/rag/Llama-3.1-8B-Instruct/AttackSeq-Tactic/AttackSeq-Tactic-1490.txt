To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Iranian hackers. They initially used spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages on social media to gain credentials for initial access. Then, they harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial access was gained but before the harvesting of email credentials.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphising Link

These TTPs all relate to the initial access tactic, which is the first step in the attack sequence. However, we are looking for the tactic that occurred after initial access was gained.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing, the next step would likely involve the exploitation of the gained access to obtain more information or credentials. The tactic that fits this description is Credential Access, as it involves the use of obtained credentials to access additional information or systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The Iranian hackers used spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages on social media to gain initial access (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service or T1566-Phishing or T1566.002-Spearphising Link).
2. After gaining initial access, the hackers would likely use the obtained credentials to access more information or systems, which is a characteristic of the Credential Access tactic.
3. The next step in the attack sequence is to harvest corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections, which is a form of Credential Access.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
