To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes the Lazarus group's malware installing a hidden 'autoupdater' module that communicates with a command and control (C2) server to download and execute additional payloads. This indicates a sequence of actions involving the installation of malware and the use of a C2 channel for further payload delivery.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
2. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

These TTPs are related to the Command and Control tactic, which involves the use of C2 channels for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer are specific techniques used for establishing and utilizing these C2 channels.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the installation of the 'autoupdater' module. The 'autoupdater' module is used to download and execute additional payloads, which implies that the C2 channel is already established.

Considering the related TTPs, both T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer are related to the establishment and use of C2 channels. However, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer specifically involves the transfer of tools or payloads through these channels, which aligns with the action of downloading and executing additional payloads.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Lazarus group first established a C2 channel using T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, and then used T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer to transfer the 'autoupdater' module and additional payloads.

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the 'autoupdater' module was installed. Given that T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the technique used for transferring the payloads, it is more likely that the tactic of Command and Control occurred before the installation of the 'autoupdater' module.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The Lazarus group established a C2 channel using T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.
2. The C2 channel was used to transfer the 'autoupdater' module and additional payloads using T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
3. The 'autoupdater' module was installed and used to download and execute additional payloads.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
