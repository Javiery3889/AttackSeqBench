To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where Tickusb infected systems via USB flash drives and then evaded detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial infection but before the evasion techniques.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (This TTP is related to the spread of malware through removable media, which is consistent with the initial infection via USB flash drives.)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (This TTP is similar to the previous one, indicating the initial infection via USB flash drives.)
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB (This TTP is related to the exfiltration of data over USB, which is not directly related to the evasion techniques described in the question.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial infection occurred via USB flash drives, which is consistent with both T1091-Replication Through Removable Media techniques. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial infection but before the evasion techniques. 

Considering the options:

A: Discovery - This tactic typically involves gathering information about the target system, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
B: Initial Access - This tactic is already covered by the related TTPs, which describe the initial infection via USB flash drives.
C: Execution - This tactic involves executing the malware on the infected system, which is a logical step after the initial infection and before the evasion techniques.
D: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the malware, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The initial infection occurred via USB flash drives, which is consistent with T1091-Replication Through Removable Media.
2. After the initial infection, the malware needs to execute on the infected system to carry out further actions.
3. The evasion techniques described in the question (altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot) are likely used after the malware has executed on the system.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
