To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the MSIL dropper deployed a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. This implies that the tactic in question is related to the initial steps of the attack, as the dropper is likely used to deliver malware.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript

These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using techniques to evade detection and execute malicious code. However, the specific techniques mentioned are related to deleting files (Defense Evasion) and executing JavaScript (Execution).

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a tactic that would precede the deployment of a dropper, which is a type of malware delivery mechanism. The tactic of Initial Access is the most likely candidate, as it involves the initial compromise of a system or network, which would be necessary for the dropper to be deployed.

The other options do not fit as well:

- Execution (A) is the tactic that involves running or loading malicious code, which is the next step after the dropper is deployed.
- Defense Evasion (C) is a tactic that involves techniques used to evade detection, but it is not the initial step in the attack sequence.
- Exfiltration (B) is a tactic that involves the unauthorized transfer of data out of a system or network, which is not related to the deployment of a dropper.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question asks about the tactic that occurred before the MSIL dropper deployed a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper.
2. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using techniques to evade detection and execute malicious code.
3. The tactic of Initial Access is the most likely candidate, as it involves the initial compromise of a system or network, which would be necessary for the dropper to be deployed.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
