Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the SombRAT backdoor has established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to transfer the collected data.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling: This technique involves using protocol tunneling to establish a covert communication channel between the attacker's C2 server and the compromised system.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS: This technique involves using DNS to establish a C2 channel.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data through a C2 channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the SombRAT backdoor has already established communication with the C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, the next step would likely involve transferring the collected data to the attacker. The related TTPs suggest that the data exfiltration would occur over the established C2 channel.

Answer Choice A (Resource Development) is incorrect because it refers to the development of new resources, which is not relevant to the scenario described.
Answer Choice B (Command and Control) is incorrect because while the initial communication was established using C2 techniques, the question specifically asks about transferring the collected data, which is a different phase of the attack.
Answer Choice D (Lateral Movement) is incorrect because it refers to moving within the network, which is not relevant to the scenario described.

Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to exfiltrate the collected data over the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: C
