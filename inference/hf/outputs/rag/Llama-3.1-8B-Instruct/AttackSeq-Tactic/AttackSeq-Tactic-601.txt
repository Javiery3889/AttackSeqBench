To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker (FIN4) targets individuals with access to confidential information. The attacker uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - These TTPs are related to initial access, specifically using spearphishing to trick victims into executing malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks which tactic occurred before FIN4 gained initial access through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used spearphishing to gain initial access.
   - Since the question asks what happened before the initial access, we need to look for a tactic that is not part of the initial access phase but is a precursor to it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Reconnaissance is a tactic that involves gathering information about a target, which is a precursor to the initial access phase.
   - The question states that the attacker targeted individuals with access to confidential M&A and market-moving information, which suggests that the attacker was gathering information about the target before attempting to gain access.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before FIN4 gained initial access is Reconnaissance.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Reconnaissance occurred before FIN4 gained initial access through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.
   - Final Answer: A
