To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers use spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links to gain initial access. The attackers also utilize an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   - These TTPs are related to initial access, specifically spear phishing, which involves using targeted emails to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes the attackers using spear phishing emails with embedded links to gain initial access. This matches the TTPs provided, which are also related to spear phishing.
   - The question also mentions the attackers utilizing an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection, which is a form of defense evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial access was gained.
   - Given that the attackers have already gained initial access through spear phishing, the next step in the attack sequence would likely involve executing the malware or payload delivered through the spear phishing email.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used spear phishing emails to gain initial access (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - The attackers then executed the malware or payload delivered through the spear phishing email, which is the next step in the attack sequence.
   - This execution of the malware or payload is a form of the Execution tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers executed the malware or payload delivered through the spear phishing email, which is a form of the Execution tactic.
   - Therefore, the final answer is:
   Final Answer: A
