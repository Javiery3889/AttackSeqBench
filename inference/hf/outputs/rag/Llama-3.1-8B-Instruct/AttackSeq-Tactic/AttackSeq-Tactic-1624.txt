To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes Earth Lusca infiltrating systems, collecting sensitive data using WinRAR and megacmd, and then facilitating secure communication with compromised systems while avoiding detection through encrypted channels and protocol tunneling.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Collection (T1560.001-Archive via Utility): This suggests that Earth Lusca is collecting data from the compromised systems.
     - Command and Control (T1572-Protocol Tunneling): This indicates that Earth Lusca is using protocol tunneling to facilitate communication with the compromised systems.
     - Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel): This implies that Earth Lusca is exfiltrating data from the compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, we can see that Earth Lusca is collecting data (Collection), using protocol tunneling for communication (Command and Control), and exfiltrating data (Exfiltration).
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred to facilitate secure communication with compromised systems while avoiding detection.
   - Given the context, the most relevant tactic is Command and Control, as it involves communication with the compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes Earth Lusca collecting data and then communicating with the compromised systems securely.
   - The related TTPs indicate that Earth Lusca is using protocol tunneling for communication, which is a technique used in Command and Control.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to Command and Control.

Final Answer: D
