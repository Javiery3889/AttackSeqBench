Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an initial access through a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via watering hole attacks, which is a type of drive-by compromise (T1189).
- The question asks about the next likely tactic involving the Poison Ivy RAT's communication with domains such as diff.qohub.info.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs are focused on Initial Access, specifically T1189-Drive-by Compromise, which is the initial access vector used in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Since the initial access has already been achieved through a drive-by compromise, the next likely tactic would be to establish a means of maintaining control over the compromised system or network.
- Command and Control (C2) is a common next step after initial access, as it involves establishing communication channels between the attacker and the compromised system for further exploitation and control.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access has been achieved through a drive-by compromise (T1189).
2. The next step would be to establish a means of maintaining control over the compromised system.
3. Command and Control (C2) is the most likely next tactic, as it involves communication between the attacker and the compromised system.

Final Answer: C
