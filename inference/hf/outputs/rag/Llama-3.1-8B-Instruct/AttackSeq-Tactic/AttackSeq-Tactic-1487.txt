To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions by Iranian threat actors, which includes creating fake personas, connecting with individuals on social media, accessing information about their location, activities, and relationships, and then sending spear-phishing messages containing links to fake pages to establish initial access.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service: This technique involves using spear-phishing messages to trick victims into providing credentials or other sensitive information.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves sending spear-phishing messages containing links to fake pages to trick victims into providing sensitive information or installing malware.
- T1585.001-Social Media Accounts: This technique involves creating fake personas and connecting with individuals on social media to gather information.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the threat actors first used social media to gather information (T1585.001-Social Media Accounts) and then used that information to send spear-phishing messages (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service or T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to establish initial access.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is gathering information through social media (T1585.001-Social Media Accounts) and then using that information to send spear-phishing messages (T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service or T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).

However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after gathering information through social media but before sending spear-phishing messages, we need to look for the tactic that is most closely related to gathering information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The threat actors created fake personas and connected with individuals on social media (T1585.001-Social Media Accounts).
2. They accessed information about the individuals' location, activities, and relationships through social media.
3. Before sending spear-phishing messages, the threat actors likely used the gathered information for reconnaissance purposes.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
