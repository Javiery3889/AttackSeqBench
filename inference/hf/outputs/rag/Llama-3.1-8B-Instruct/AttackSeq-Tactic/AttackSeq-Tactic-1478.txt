Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Duke group securely communicated with their command-and-control (C2) server using layered encryption and encoding for managing the compromised systems. This indicates that the group is using techniques to maintain control over the compromised systems and communicate with their C2 server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection and maintain confidentiality.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 communications.

Based on these TTPs, it is clear that the Duke group is using techniques to maintain control over the compromised systems and communicate with their C2 server securely.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the scenario and the related TTPs, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to maintain control over the compromised systems and exfiltrate data or other resources. 

- Option A (Collection) is not the most likely next step, as collection typically involves gathering information from the compromised systems, but it doesn't necessarily involve maintaining control.
- Option B (Exfiltration) is a plausible next step, as the group may want to exfiltrate data or other resources from the compromised systems after maintaining control.
- Option C (Lateral Movement) is not directly related to the scenario, as lateral movement involves moving within the network, which is not mentioned in the scenario.
- Option D (Command and Control) is the current step being described in the scenario, so it's not the next step.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
