Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker using Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and compromise additional endpoints. The attacker then proceeds to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information. This indicates a phase of lateral movement, where the attacker is moving within the network to find and access valuable data.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares: This technique involves using Windows admin shares to move laterally within the network.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools to a new system to facilitate further lateral movement.

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- A: Resource Development: This tactic involves creating or acquiring new tools, which is not directly related to the lateral movement efforts described in the question.
- B: Defense Evasion: This tactic involves evading detection by security controls, which is not the primary focus of the question.
- C: Credential Access: This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials to access systems, which could be a precursor to lateral movement but is not the most direct precursor to the described actions.
- D: Discovery: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which aligns with the initial use of Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network and compromise additional endpoints.

Based on the related TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of events is that the attacker first used discovery techniques (e.g., Cobalt Strike beacon) to gather information about the network and compromise additional endpoints. This discovery phase would have provided the necessary information for the lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information.

Final Answer: D
