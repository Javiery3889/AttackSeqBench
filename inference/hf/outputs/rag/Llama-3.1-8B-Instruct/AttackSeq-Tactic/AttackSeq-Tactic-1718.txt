To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker, starting with reconnaissance using Nmap, Nbtscan, and net user to identify lateral movement opportunities. The next step is collecting high-privilege network credentials and extracting password hashes from NTDS.dit files.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003.003-NTDS (extracting password hashes from NTDS.dit files)
     - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash (using extracted password hashes for lateral movement)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1550.002-Pass the Hash (using extracted password hashes for lateral movement, which can be considered a defense evasion technique as it evades detection by not using the actual password)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before collecting high-privilege network credentials and extracting password hashes from NTDS.dit files. 
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used lateral movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash) after collecting credentials and hashes. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this step.
   - The only tactic that fits this description is Lateral Movement, as it is the step that occurs before the attacker collects high-privilege network credentials and extracts password hashes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions, starting with reconnaissance and then lateral movement.
   - The lateral movement is followed by collecting high-privilege network credentials and extracting password hashes from NTDS.dit files.
   - Based on the related TTPs, the tactic that occurred before collecting high-privilege network credentials and extracting password hashes is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: B
