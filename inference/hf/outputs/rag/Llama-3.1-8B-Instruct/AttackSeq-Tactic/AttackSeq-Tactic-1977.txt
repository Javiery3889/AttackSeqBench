To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of events where a self-extracting wrapper file is used to conceal a Gh0st payload, and the embedded DLL of the Trojan is executed. The malware then establishes communication using a custom network protocol through its server hosted at 98.126.67.114. We need to identify the next ATT&CK tactic that likely occurred.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the question involves Defense Evasion techniques (T1027.013 and T1027.009) to conceal the Gh0st payload and execute the embedded DLL. The next step would likely involve establishing communication with the malware's server, which is a characteristic of Command and Control (C2) tactics.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question mentions the use of a self-extracting wrapper file to conceal the Gh0st payload, which aligns with Defense Evasion techniques (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1027.009-Embedded Payloads).
2. The execution of the embedded DLL of the Trojan also falls under Defense Evasion.
3. The malware then establishes communication using a custom network protocol through its server hosted at 98.126.67.114, which is a characteristic of Command and Control (C2) tactics.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Command and Control, as it aligns with the malware's communication with its server. 

Final Answer: C
