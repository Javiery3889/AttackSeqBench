Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker, WhiteBear, gains initial access through spearphishing with malicious PDF files. After gaining access, the binary loader injects code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred during this step.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs include:

- Privilege Escalation (Tactic) with Process Injection (T1055) and Process Injection (T1055) as techniques. This indicates that the attacker is using process injection to escalate privileges.
- Execution (Tactic) with Malicious File (T1204.002) as a technique. This suggests that the attacker is using a malicious file to execute code.
- Defense Evasion (Tactic) with Process Injection (T1055) as a technique. This indicates that the attacker is using process injection to evade detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the binary loader injecting code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem is a form of process injection. This is a technique used for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred when the binary loader began injecting code.

Considering the related TTPs, the most relevant tactic is Execution, as it involves the execution of malicious code. The process injection is a technique used to execute the malicious code, making it a part of the Execution tactic.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker gains initial access through spearphishing with malicious PDF files, which is not directly related to the current step.
2. The binary loader injects code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem, which is a form of process injection.
3. Process injection is a technique used for both Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred when the code was injected.
4. The Execution tactic involves the execution of malicious code, and process injection is a technique used to execute the code.

Final Answer: C
