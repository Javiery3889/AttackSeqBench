To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:** The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers before achieving initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   - These TTPs indicate that GreyEnergy initially gained access through exploiting public-facing applications and spearphishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control:** This tactic is about maintaining a connection with the compromised system. It doesn't directly relate to the initial targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves creating or acquiring new tools, techniques, or infrastructure. While it might be related to the overall attack, it's not directly connected to the initial targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering information from the compromised system. It's not directly related to the initial targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. Given that GreyEnergy targeted ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers, it's likely that they conducted reconnaissance to identify these systems and their vulnerabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - GreyEnergy initially gained access through exploiting public-facing applications and spearphishing.
   - To achieve this, they likely conducted reconnaissance to identify the public-facing applications and the potential targets (ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers).
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that informed their strategic targeting is reconnaissance.

5. **Final Answer:** D: Reconnaissance
