Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where a macro in a lure document is enabled, which triggers malicious PowerShell commands. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves using a malicious file to execute an attack. In this case, the malicious file is the lure document with a macro.
- T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute an attack. The question mentions that the malicious PowerShell commands are triggered after enabling the macro in the lure document.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question mentions that the malicious PowerShell commands are triggered after enabling the macro in the lure document. This implies that the malicious file (lure document) was used to execute the PowerShell commands.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload. This implies that the tactic occurred before the execution of the payload.

Based on the related TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of events is:
1. The malicious file (lure document) was used to execute the attack (T1204.002-Malicious File).
2. The execution of the malicious file led to the execution of PowerShell commands (T1059.001-PowerShell).
3. The PowerShell commands were used to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

Considering the ATT&CK tactics, the tactic that occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload is Initial Access. Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining access to a system or network, which in this case, was achieved through the malicious file (lure document).

Final Answer: D
