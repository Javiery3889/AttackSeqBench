To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries used various techniques to avoid detection and remove security software. The techniques mentioned are:

1. Obfuscated files
2. Software packing
3. Fileless malware attacks
4. Removal of security software (specifically Alibaba Aliyun Aegis cloud security software)

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to Defense Evasion, which is a tactic that involves techniques used to evade or avoid detection by security software. The specific techniques mentioned are:

1. T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion (exploiting vulnerabilities to evade detection)
2. T1027.002-Software Packing (packing software to evade detection)
3. T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (obfuscating files or information to evade detection)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the techniques mentioned in the question and the related TTPs, we can see that all the techniques are related to Defense Evasion. The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before these techniques were used. Since all the techniques are related to Defense Evasion, it's likely that the tactic that occurred before these techniques was also related to Defense Evasion.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries used various techniques to avoid detection and remove security software.
2. The techniques mentioned are all related to Defense Evasion (obfuscated files, software packing, fileless malware attacks, and removal of security software).
3. The related TTPs are also all related to Defense Evasion.
4. Since all the techniques and TTPs are related to Defense Evasion, it's likely that the tactic that occurred before these techniques was also related to Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
