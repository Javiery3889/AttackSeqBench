Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques related to an attack, focusing on the exploitation of a vulnerability for initial access and the subsequent use of webshells. It asks for the tactic that most likely involved the upload of tools such as Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro before establishing persistence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs include:
  - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This indicates the initial step of the attack, where the attacker exploits a public-facing application vulnerability for initial access.
  - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1136.001-Local Account: This suggests the establishment of persistence, specifically through the creation of a local account.
  - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves the transfer of tools into the compromised system, which is relevant to the upload of tools like Mimikatz and HyperBro.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely involved the upload of tools before establishing persistence. Given the related TTPs, the upload of tools like Mimikatz and HyperBro is most closely related to the Command and Control tactic, as it involves the transfer of tools into the compromised system.
- The other options do not fit as well:
  - Initial Access (A) is the initial step of the attack, which has already occurred.
  - Execution (B) involves the execution of the initial payload, but it does not specifically involve the upload of tools.
  - Reconnaissance (D) is the initial gathering of information about the target, which is not relevant to the upload of tools.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of events following initial access, focusing on the upload of tools.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the upload of tools is related to Command and Control.
3. The Command and Control tactic involves the transfer of tools into the compromised system, which aligns with the upload of Mimikatz and HyperBro.

Final Answer: C: Collection
