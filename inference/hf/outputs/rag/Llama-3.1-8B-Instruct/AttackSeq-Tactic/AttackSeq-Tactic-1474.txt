To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of events initiated by the Duke group, which includes:

1. Compromising high-profile government networks via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails with Trojan.Cozer.
2. Using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
3. Extracting email from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Lateral Movement (Tactic) with Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) as a technique.
2. Defense Evasion (Tactic) with Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) as a technique.
3. Credential Access (Tactic) with Ccache Files (T1558.005) as a technique.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the sequence of events described in the question, we can infer the following:

1. The initial compromise of high-profile government networks via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails with Trojan.Cozer is likely a Reconnaissance or Initial Access tactic, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs.
2. The use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks is mentioned, which is related to Lateral Movement (Tactic) and Defense Evasion (Tactic) with Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) as a technique.
3. The extraction of email from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials is related to Credential Access (Tactic).

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Initial compromise (not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs)
2. Lateral Movement (Tactic) with Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) as a technique ( Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks)
3. Credential Access (Tactic) with Ccache Files (T1558.005) as a technique (email extraction from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials)

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a sequence of events initiated by the Duke group.
2. The initial compromise is not explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, but it's likely a Reconnaissance or Initial Access tactic.
3. The use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks is related to Lateral Movement (Tactic) and Defense Evasion (Tactic) with Pass the Ticket (T1550.003) as a technique.
4. The extraction of email from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials is related to Credential Access (Tactic).
5. Based on the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement (Tactic) followed by Credential Access (Tactic).

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
