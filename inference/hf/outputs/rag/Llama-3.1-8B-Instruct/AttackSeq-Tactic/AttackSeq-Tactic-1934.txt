To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was achieved through emails embedding malicious documents. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Dridex malware communicated with its command and control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (communication with C2 servers via web protocols)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spearphishing via links)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphising Attachment (spearphishing via attachments)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, we need to consider the order in which these TTPs could occur in an attack.

1. The initial access was achieved through emails embedding malicious documents (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. The malware (Dridex) was executed on the compromised system (C: Execution).
3. The malware communicated with its C2 servers via encrypted POST requests (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

Considering the order of these TTPs, we can see that the Execution tactic (C) is the most likely to occur before the Command and Control tactic (A). This is because the malware needs to be executed on the compromised system before it can communicate with the C2 servers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Initial access was achieved through emails embedding malicious documents (T1566.001-Spearphising Attachment).
2. The malicious documents were executed on the compromised system (C: Execution).
3. The executed malware communicated with its C2 servers via encrypted POST requests (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
