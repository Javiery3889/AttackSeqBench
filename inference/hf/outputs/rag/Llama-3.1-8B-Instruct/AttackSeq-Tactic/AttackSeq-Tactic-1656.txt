To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware, including executing a PowerShell script at the memory level, downloading main malware components, and then employing base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the malware used base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts and manipulate scheduled tasks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to maintain persistence.
     - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This technique involves using scheduled tasks for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the malware creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks. This directly aligns with the techniques T1053.005-Scheduled Task and T1547.009-Shortcut Modification, which are both related to persistence.
   - The question also mentions the malware employing base64 encoded strings, which is not directly related to the provided techniques but is a common method used in various attack phases, including execution.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the malware used base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts and manipulate scheduled tasks. Since the creation of shortcuts and manipulation of scheduled tasks are directly related to persistence, it is likely that the tactic of persistence occurred before these actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that includes downloading main malware components, which is likely a part of the execution phase.
   - However, the specific actions of creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks are directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware executed (downloaded main malware components) and then employed persistence techniques (created shortcuts and manipulated scheduled tasks) to maintain its activities.

Final Answer: A
