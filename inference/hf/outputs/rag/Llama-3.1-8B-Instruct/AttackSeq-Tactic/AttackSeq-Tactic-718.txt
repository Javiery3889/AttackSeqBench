To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where the Aria-body backdoor has already gathered system information and collected files, screenshots, and metadata. The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System (gathering system information and data)
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrating data over a C2 channel)
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture (capturing screenshots)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker has already collected data (T1005 and T1113). The next logical step would be to exfiltrate the collected data to the C2 server. The technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most relevant to this scenario, as it involves sending the stolen data to the C2 server.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker has already gathered system information and collected files, screenshots, and metadata using T1005-Data from Local System and T1113-Screen Capture.
2. The next step would be to send the collected data to the C2 server for further analysis and command execution.
3. The most relevant technique for this step is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which involves sending data to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
