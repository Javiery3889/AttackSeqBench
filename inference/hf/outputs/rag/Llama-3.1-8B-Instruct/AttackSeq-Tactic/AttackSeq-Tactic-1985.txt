To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the RAT was set to automatically relaunch, let's analyze the given information and related TTPs.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question describes a multi-stage process involving unpacking, memory injection, and execution of the IEXPL0RE RAT.
    - The RAT is then set to automatically relaunch through the Start Menu and %temp% folder.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - T1059.003-Windows Command Shell: This technique involves the use of a command shell to execute commands. It's related to Execution.
    - T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: This technique involves modifying the registry to add a malicious entry that will execute a program at startup, which is related to Persistence.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - The question mentions the RAT being set to automatically relaunch through the Start Menu and %temp% folder. This implies that the attacker is attempting to maintain access to the system over time.
    - The related TTPs suggest that the attacker used a command shell to execute the RAT and then modified the registry to ensure the RAT relaunches at startup.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that the attacker used a command shell to execute the RAT (Execution) and then modified the registry to ensure the RAT relaunches at startup (Persistence).

Final Answer: D
