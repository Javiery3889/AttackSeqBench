To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Operation WizardOpium exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence involving a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome, which leads to a Use-After-Free condition for arbitrary read/write access. This is followed by tasks being installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This TTP involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to install malware for persistence.
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: This TTP involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task: This TTP involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to execute malware.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: Execution - This tactic is likely to occur after the exploitation of the vulnerability, as it involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to execute malware, which is a common step after gaining arbitrary read/write access.
B: Persistence - This tactic is likely to occur after the execution of malware, as it involves installing malware in the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence.
C: Defense Evasion - This tactic is not directly related to the described attack sequence, as it involves techniques to evade detection, which is not the focus of the question.
D: Exfiltration - This tactic is not directly related to the described attack sequence, as it involves the unauthorized transfer of data, which is not the focus of the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attack sequence starts with the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome, which leads to a Use-After-Free condition for arbitrary read/write access.
2. The next step is likely to be Execution, as the attacker needs to execute malware to gain further control over the system.
3. After execution, the attacker would likely install malware in the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence.

**Final Answer: Execution**
