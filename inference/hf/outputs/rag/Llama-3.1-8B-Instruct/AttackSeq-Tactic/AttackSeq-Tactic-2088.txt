To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions involving malware that maintains persistence using a registry key and then initiates HTTPS communication with a command and control (C2) server to send gathered system information. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after persistence was established but before the HTTPS communication.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry (modifying the registry to evade detection)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (maintaining persistence using a registry key)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (maintaining persistence through autostart execution)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, we need to find the tactic that occurred after persistence was established but before the HTTPS communication. 

- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that help the adversary evade detection, but it doesn't necessarily imply a sequence of actions that would occur after persistence and before C2 communication.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which could be a precursor to establishing persistence or C2 communication but doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which could be a plausible step after persistence is established and before C2 communication. The malware would need to execute to gather system information and send it to the C2 server.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves communication between the malware and the C2 server, which is the final step described in the question.

Considering the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurred after persistence was established (using a registry key) and before the HTTPS communication with the C2 server is **Execution**. This is because the malware needs to execute to gather system information and send it to the C2 server.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malware maintains persistence using a registry key (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder).
2. After persistence is established, the malware executes to gather system information (Tactic: Execution).
3. The malware initiates HTTPS communication with the C2 server to send the gathered system information (Tactic: Command and Control).

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
