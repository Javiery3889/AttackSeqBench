To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the "Infamous Chisel" tool's "netd" component is used to exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This indicates that the attacker is exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories: This suggests that the attacker is hiding files and directories to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the context of the question, we are looking for a tactic that is likely to occur after the exfiltration of files. Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: Credential Access: This tactic involves the unauthorized access to, or use of, sensitive credentials. While it's possible that credential access could occur after exfiltration, it's not the most direct or likely next step in this scenario.
     - B: Discovery: This tactic involves the gathering of information about the victim's environment. While discovery is a common initial step in many attacks, it's not directly related to the exfiltration of files.
     - C: Exfiltration: This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a victim's system. Since the question already describes exfiltration, this is not the most likely next step.
     - D: Impact: This tactic involves the disruption or destruction of the victim's system or data. While impact could be a potential goal of the attack, it's not directly related to the exfiltration of files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the question, the most plausible next step after exfiltration would be to use the exfiltrated data for further malicious activities. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after exfiltration, not what the exfiltrated data was used for. 
   - Since the question is asking for the tactic that occurred after exfiltration, we should look for a tactic that is not directly related to the exfiltration itself but could be a subsequent step in the attack. 
   - Considering the provided TTPs, the most plausible next step after exfiltration would be to use the Defense Evasion technique to hide the evidence of the exfiltration or to maintain access to the victim's system. However, this is not an option.
   - Since the question is asking for a tactic and not a technique, we should look for a tactic that is related to the provided TTPs. 
   - Given the provided TTPs, the most plausible next step after exfiltration would be to use the gathered information for further malicious activities, which is related to the Discovery tactic.

Final Answer: B
