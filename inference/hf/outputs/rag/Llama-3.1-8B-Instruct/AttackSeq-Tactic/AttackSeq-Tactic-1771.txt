To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of tactics in an attack, specifically which tactic occurred before the attackers used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and execute reconnaissance of the card processing service.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture (capturing credentials)
2. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts (gaining initial access)
3. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials (using credentials for reconnaissance)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attackers first captured credentials (T1056.003-Web Portal Capture) and then used those credentials for initial access (T1078-Valid Accounts). After gaining initial access, they used the captured credentials for reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials).

Given this sequence, the question asks which tactic occurred before the attackers used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and execute reconnaissance of the card processing service. The correct answer must be the tactic that occurred before the reconnaissance.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers captured credentials (T1056.003-Web Portal Capture).
2. They used those credentials for initial access (T1078-Valid Accounts).
3. After gaining initial access, they used the captured credentials for reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials).

Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the attackers used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and execute reconnaissance of the card processing service is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
