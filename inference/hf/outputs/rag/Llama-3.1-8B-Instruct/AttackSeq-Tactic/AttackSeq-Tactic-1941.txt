To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Mustang Panda's campaign, specifically focusing on the tactics and techniques used before collecting data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred during this campaign.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media (collection of data from removable media)
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (replication of malware through removable media)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (replication of malware through removable media)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques T1025 and T1091 both involve removable media, but they are categorized under different tactics: Collection and Lateral Movement, respectively. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before collecting data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives.

Given the sequence of actions, it is likely that the campaign first replicated the malware through removable media (T1091) to gain access to the system, and then collected data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives (T1025). This sequence aligns with the tactics of Initial Access and Collection, respectively.

However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred before collecting data, we can eliminate Collection (A) as the correct answer. Defense Evasion (B) is not directly related to the sequence of actions described. Resource Development (D) is also not relevant to the sequence.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access, which is associated with the technique T1091-Replication Through Removable Media.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Mustang Panda's campaign.
2. The related TTPs include techniques T1025 and T1091, both involving removable media.
3. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before collecting data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives.
4. The sequence of actions likely involves replicating malware through removable media (T1091) to gain access to the system, followed by collecting data (T1025).
5. The tactic that occurred before collecting data is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
