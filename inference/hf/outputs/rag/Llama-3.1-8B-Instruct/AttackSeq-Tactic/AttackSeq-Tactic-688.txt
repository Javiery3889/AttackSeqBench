To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Privilege Escalation (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)
- Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)
- Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
To determine the most plausible sequence, we need to understand the order of events in the attack. The question mentions that the backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items, which is a technique used for persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder). This implies that the persistence tactic occurred after the initial access.

Given the related TTPs, we can see that the Initial Access tactic (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is the most likely precursor to the persistence tactic. This is because the initial access is gained through spearphishing attachments, and the persistence tactic is used to maintain access to the system.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attack starts with Initial Access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment), where the attacker gains access to the system via a malicious Excel document with an embedded macro.
2. The attacker then uses the gained access to execute the backdoor program (Execution tactic).
3. The backdoor program employs persistence by writing startup items (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) to maintain access to the system.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
