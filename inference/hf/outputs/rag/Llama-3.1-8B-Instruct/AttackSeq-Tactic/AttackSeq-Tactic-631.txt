To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker who has gained initial access using tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' to scan and exploit targets. The attacker then escalated privileges by compromising administrator credentials, which is represented by TG-3279. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before this escalation.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to Privilege Escalation, which is the tactic we are interested in. The techniques listed are:

- T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
- T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This technique involves using domain accounts to escalate privileges.
- T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves using valid accounts to escalate privileges.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given that the attacker has already gained initial access and is now escalating privileges, we need to determine which tactic occurred before this escalation. The question mentions compromising administrator credentials, which suggests that the attacker used valid accounts to escalate privileges.

Based on the related TTPs, T1078-Valid Accounts is the most relevant technique, as it involves using valid accounts to escalate privileges. This technique is a common method for privilege escalation, especially when an attacker has already gained initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker gained initial access using tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' to scan and exploit targets.
2. The attacker then escalated privileges, which is represented by TG-3279.
3. The escalation involved compromising administrator credentials, which suggests the use of valid accounts.
4. Based on the related TTPs, T1078-Valid Accounts is the most relevant technique for this scenario.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
