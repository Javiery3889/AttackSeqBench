Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving enabling macros that executed payloads, followed by a backdoor function gathering machine information and sending it to a C&C server. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after enabling macros and before the backdoor function's actions.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves using a malicious file to execute a payload, which is related to the Execution tactic.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique is related to Initial Access, which involves tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question mentions enabling macros that executed payloads, which aligns with the Execution tactic (T1204.002-Malicious File).
- The backdoor function gathering machine information and sending it to the C&C server is related to the Persistence tactic, as it involves maintaining access to the compromised system.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after enabling macros and before the backdoor function's actions. Therefore, we need to find a tactic that logically follows Execution and precedes Persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Enabling macros that executed payloads is related to the Execution tactic (T1204.002-Malicious File).
2. The next step in the sequence would be to establish a persistent presence on the compromised system, which is related to the Persistence tactic.
3. The backdoor function gathering machine information and sending it to the C&C server is a part of the Persistence tactic.

Final Answer: B: Persistence
