To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the distribution of the Phenakite iOS surveillanceware, followed by persistence through a jailbreak using the Osiris jailbreak and Sock Port exploit. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial distribution and before the persistence.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Lateral Movement (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media): This technique involves moving laterally within a network using removable media.
     - Persistence (T1053.002-At): This technique involves adding, altering, or creating files or configuration information in the current user's Startup or load point for the next system boot.
     - Persistence (T1543.001-Launch Agent): This technique involves using a launch agent to maintain persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the persistence techniques (T1053.002-At and T1543.001-Launch Agent) are related to maintaining a foothold on the system after initial access. Lateral Movement (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media) is a technique that allows the attacker to move laterally within a network, but it is not directly related to the persistence of malware on a single system.
   - Given that the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial distribution of the malware and before the persistence through a jailbreak, we need to consider the sequence of events. The distribution of the malware (Initial Access) is followed by the execution of the malware, which would likely involve the replication of the malware within the system to maintain its presence. This is where Lateral Movement (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media) could fit in the sequence, as it involves the replication of the malware within the system.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Arid Viper distributed the Phenakite iOS surveillanceware using a mobile configuration profile.
     2. Lateral Movement: The malware replicates within the system using removable media (T1091-Replication Through Removable Media).
     3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence through a jailbreak using the Osiris jailbreak and Sock Port exploit.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial distribution and before the persistence is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: C
