To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker evading detection through modified network traffic patterns and an encrypted downloader. This suggests that the attacker is attempting to remain undetected while communicating with servers. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to maintain communication with servers such as roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation: This TTP involves an attacker impersonating a legitimate service or protocol to maintain communication with a command and control (C2) server.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This TTP involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading: This TTP involves disguising malicious files or processes as legitimate ones to evade detection.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, the attacker has already evaded detection through modified network traffic patterns and an encrypted downloader. The next step would likely involve maintaining communication with the C2 servers. 

- Option A (Credential Access) is not directly related to maintaining communication with C2 servers.
- Option B (Defense Evasion) is relevant to the initial evasion techniques, but it's not the next step in the attack sequence.
- Option C (Collection) is not directly related to maintaining communication with C2 servers.
- Option D (Command and Control) is the most plausible choice, as it involves maintaining communication with C2 servers, which aligns with the attacker's goal of evading detection and maintaining a connection with servers like roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker evaded detection through modified network traffic patterns and an encrypted downloader.
2. To maintain communication with C2 servers, the attacker would need to impersonate a legitimate service or protocol to avoid detection.
3. The most relevant TTP for this step is T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
