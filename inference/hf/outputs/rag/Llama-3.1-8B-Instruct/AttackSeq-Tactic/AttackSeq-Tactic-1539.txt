To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attacker moving laterally across the infrastructure, targeting internal hosts and servers, and then preparing documents for exfiltration. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the attackers prepared these documents.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging: This technique involves staging data in a remote location for exfiltration. It's related to the final step of preparing documents for exfiltration.
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems to facilitate lateral movement.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which could be related to gathering information about internal applications and procedures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within the network to reach other systems. It's a plausible step before preparing documents for exfiltration, as the attackers need to reach the systems containing the information they want to exfiltrate.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information, but it's not directly related to the lateral movement described in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a command and control channel, which is not directly related to the lateral movement or the preparation of documents for exfiltration.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves increasing privileges to access more sensitive information, but it's not directly related to the lateral movement or the preparation of documents for exfiltration.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure (Lateral Movement) to reach the systems containing the information they want to exfiltrate, and then prepared documents pertaining to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
