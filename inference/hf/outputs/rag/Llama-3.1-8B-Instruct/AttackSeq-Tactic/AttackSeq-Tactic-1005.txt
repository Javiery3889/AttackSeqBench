To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after WINDSHIFT APT sent emails with credential harvesting links mimicking password recovery or reset requests, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where WINDSHIFT APT sent emails with credential harvesting links. These links are designed to mimic password recovery or reset requests, which is a common tactic used to trick victims into revealing their credentials.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provided are:

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphising Link

These TTPs indicate that the attackers used spearphishing links to gain initial access and conduct reconnaissance. However, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the credential harvesting links were sent.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given that the attackers sent credential harvesting links, the most likely next step would be to access the credentials obtained from the victims. This would involve using the obtained credentials to access the victim's system or account.

Based on the ATT&CK framework, the tactic that involves accessing or obtaining credentials is **Credential Access**.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers sent emails with credential harvesting links (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
2. The victims clicked on the links, revealing their credentials.
3. The attackers would then use the obtained credentials to access the victim's system or account, which falls under the **Credential Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: A**
