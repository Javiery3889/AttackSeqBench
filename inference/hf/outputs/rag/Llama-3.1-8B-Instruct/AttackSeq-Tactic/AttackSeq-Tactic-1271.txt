To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, specifically TG1021. The sequence involves interfering with logging mechanisms to evade detection, followed by using publicly available offensive security tools for target mapping and reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion
   - These TTPs are related to the tactics of Discovery and Defense Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the attacker actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic. This is followed by using publicly available offensive security tools for target mapping and reconnaissance, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network, which is consistent with the use of tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.
   - The sequence of Defense Evasion followed by Discovery makes sense, as the attacker would first try to evade detection and then gather information about the target system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attacker first uses Defense Evasion techniques (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion) to evade detection by interfering with logging mechanisms (T1018-Remote System Discovery is not directly related to this step, but it is a discovery technique, which is the next step).
   - After evading detection, the attacker uses publicly available offensive security tools (SharpHound and PowerSploit) for target mapping and reconnaissance, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the related TTPs, the most likely tactic that occurred after Defense Evasion (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion) and before Discovery (using publicly available offensive security tools) is also Discovery, as it is the next logical step in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: C
