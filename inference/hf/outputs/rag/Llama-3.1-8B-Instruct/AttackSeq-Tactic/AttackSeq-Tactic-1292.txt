To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred before OceanLotus gained initial access through spear-phishing emails. This means we are looking for the tactic that happened before the initial access was gained.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   These TTPs indicate that the attackers used spear-phishing emails with links or attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about a target before launching an attack. While reconnaissance is an important step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the initial access gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves creating or acquiring tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to be used in an attack. While resource development is an important step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the initial access gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target's system or network. While collection is an important step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the initial access gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities. However, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the initial access was gained, which is not directly related to discovery.

However, given the context of the question, we can infer that the correct answer is not listed. The question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the initial access was gained, which is not explicitly listed in the answer choices. However, based on the context of the question, we can infer that the correct answer is likely related to the preparation or planning phase of the attack.

However, if we had to choose from the given options, the closest answer would be **B: Resource Development**, as it is the most plausible option given the context of the question. However, please note that this is an educated guess, and the correct answer is not explicitly listed.

**Final Answer: B**
