To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes attackers maintaining persistent access to compromised bank systems by configuring remote access to servers and making firewall configuration changes. This indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access and are now working to maintain their presence within the system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1222.002-Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification: This TTP involves modifying file and directory permissions to evade detection.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services: This TTP involves configuring remote access to servers to maintain persistent access.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of maintaining persistent access, the most relevant TTP is Tactic: Persistence. The question describes configuring remote access to servers, which aligns with the technique of T1133-External Remote Services. This technique is used to maintain access to the system, making it the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers have already gained initial access to the bank systems.
2. To maintain their presence, they need to configure remote access to servers.
3. Configuring remote access to servers is a technique used for persistence (T1133-External Remote Services).
4. The other TTPs (Defense Evasion and Exfiltration) do not directly relate to maintaining persistent access.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
