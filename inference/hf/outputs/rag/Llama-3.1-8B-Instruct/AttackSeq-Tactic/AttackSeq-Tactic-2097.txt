To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of tactics used by Suckfly, specifically the tactic that occurred before they used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content (This TTP is related to the spread of malware within the network after initial access has been gained.)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise (This TTP is related to the initial compromise of the victim's system.)
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping (This TTP is related to the extraction of credentials from the compromised system.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the sequence of events likely occurred as follows:

1. Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise): The victim's system was compromised through a drive-by download.
2. Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping): Credentials were extracted from the compromised system.
3. Lateral Movement (T1080-Taint Shared Content): The malware spread to other internal hosts, likely using the extracted credentials.

Given this sequence, the tactic that occurred before Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts is likely Initial Access, as it is the initial step in the sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question asks about the sequence of tactics used by Suckfly.
2. The related TTPs include Initial Access, Lateral Movement, and Credential Access.
3. Lateral Movement and Credential Access are likely to occur after Initial Access.
4. The sequence of events is: Initial Access -> Credential Access -> Lateral Movement.
5. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
