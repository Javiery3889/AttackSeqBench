To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable. Then, the TDrop2 malware uses process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include Defense Evasion (Tactic) and Process Hollowing (Technique T1055.012). Additionally, there's a mention of Privilege Escalation (Tactic) with the same technique, but it seems to be a duplicate or a mistake in the provided information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the use of process hollowing (T1055.012) for injecting malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable. 
   - Process hollowing is a technique used for Defense Evasion, as it allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, making it harder to detect.
   - Privilege Escalation is not directly related to the process of injecting code into a legitimate process, but rather to gaining elevated privileges on the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable, which is a form of initial access.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is the use of process hollowing (T1055.012) to inject malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable, which is a Defense Evasion technique.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the use of process hollowing is likely related to the initial access or the preparation for the attack, which is not explicitly listed in the provided TTPs. However, given the options, the closest related tactic is Defense Evasion, as it is the tactic associated with the technique used in the next step of the attack sequence.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable, and then Defense Evasion was used to inject malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable using process hollowing (T1055.012).
   - Therefore, the answer is: **Final Answer: B**
