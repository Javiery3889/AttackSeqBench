To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT Group, which includes delivering an ISO file containing malicious scripts and then using 'stopedge.bat' to schedule tasks for maintaining persistence. We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the delivery of the malicious scripts and before the scheduling of tasks.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task (related to maintaining persistence)
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task (related to executing malicious scripts)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the technique T1053.005 - Scheduled Task is associated with both persistence and execution tactics. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the delivery of the malicious scripts and before the scheduling of tasks for maintaining persistence.

Given that the delivery of the malicious scripts is an execution tactic (as it involves running the scripts), the most plausible sequence would be:

1. Execution (delivery of the malicious scripts)
2. Persistence (scheduling tasks for maintaining persistence using 'stopedge.bat')

Therefore, the tactic that occurred after the delivery of the malicious scripts and before the scheduling of tasks for maintaining persistence is Execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The Konni APT Group delivered an ISO file containing malicious scripts.
2. The delivery of the malicious scripts is an execution tactic (Tactic: Execution).
3. The next step in the sequence is to schedule tasks for maintaining persistence using 'stopedge.bat'.
4. Scheduling tasks for maintaining persistence is a persistence tactic (Tactic: Persistence).

**Final Answer: A**
