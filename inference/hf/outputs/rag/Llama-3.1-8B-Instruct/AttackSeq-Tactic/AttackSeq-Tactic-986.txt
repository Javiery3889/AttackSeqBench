To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious actor communicates with three command and control (C2) servers for further control and data transfer. The goal is to download and execute the FinSpy payload and display a lure document to the victim.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. T1204.002 - Malicious File: This technique involves downloading and executing a malicious file.
2. T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to gain initial access to a victim's system.
3. T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring a tool or payload into a victim's system.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: Command and Control - This tactic is related to the communication with C2 servers, but it doesn't directly involve the execution of the FinSpy payload or displaying the lure document.

B: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a victim's system, which is not directly related to the execution of the FinSpy payload or displaying the lure document.

C: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from a victim's system, which is not directly related to the execution of the FinSpy payload or displaying the lure document.

D: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials from a victim's system, which is not directly related to the execution of the FinSpy payload or displaying the lure document.

However, the question mentions the execution of the FinSpy payload and displaying the lure document, which is related to the Execution tactic. The Execution tactic involves the execution of a malicious file, which is described in T1204.002 - Malicious File. This technique is likely used after the initial access is gained through a spearphishing link (T1566.002) and the malicious file is transferred into the victim's system through Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105).

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after communicating with three command and control servers for further control and data transfer. This implies that the Command and Control tactic is the most relevant, as it involves the communication with C2 servers.

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to download and execute the FinSpy payload and display the lure document. The Execution tactic is the most relevant here, as it involves the execution of the malicious file. The Execution tactic is likely used after the initial access is gained through a spearphishing link and the malicious file is transferred into the victim's system through Ingress Tool Transfer.
