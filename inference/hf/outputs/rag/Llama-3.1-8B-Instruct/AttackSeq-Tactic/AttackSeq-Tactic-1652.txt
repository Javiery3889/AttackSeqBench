Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the deployment of njRAT malware, collection of Kavach authentication databases, and the use of modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these actions.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to Credential Access, specifically T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers. This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most likely next step would be to exfiltrate the stolen credentials. This is because the question mentions credential harvesting and browser password stealing, which are both related to collecting sensitive information. Exfiltration is the tactic of extracting or transferring data from a system or network, which aligns with the goal of stealing and transferring the collected credentials.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The njRAT malware is deployed with victim IDs of 'kavach', indicating an initial access or compromise of the system.
2. The malware uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect Kavach authentication databases, which is a form of credential access.
3. SideCopy extensively uses modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing, which is also a form of credential access.
4. The next logical step after collecting credentials would be to exfiltrate them, which is the transfer of the stolen credentials from the system.

Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
