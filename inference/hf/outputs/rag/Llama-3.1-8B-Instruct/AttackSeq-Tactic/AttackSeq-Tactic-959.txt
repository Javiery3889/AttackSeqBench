Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols. This indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now exfiltrating the stolen credentials.

Analysis of the Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, which involve the communication between an attacker's C2 server and the compromised system. The techniques listed are:

- T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP) to communicate with the C2 server.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols: This is a sub-technique of T1071, specifically using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication.
- T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols (e.g., DNS, SMB) for C2 communication.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols, the next likely tactic is not Initial Access (A), as the attacker has already gained access to the system. Exfiltration (B) is also not the correct answer, as the question specifically mentions sending credentials to a C2 server, which is a form of Command and Control, not exfiltration. Credential Access (D) is also not the correct answer, as the question states that the credentials have already been stolen and sent to the C2 server.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used the stolen credentials to communicate with the C2 server using standard application layer protocols, which aligns with the Command and Control (C) tactic.

Final Answer: C
