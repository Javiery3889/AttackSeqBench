To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where a malicious app is advertised on a dedicated Arabic website, and the attacker wants to ensure the Welcome Chat app auto-starts at device boot to maintain its functionality. This implies that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the device and is now trying to maintain persistence.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This TTP is related to gaining persistence by ensuring an application starts automatically at boot or logon.
2. **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**: This TTP is related to hiding files and directories to evade detection.
3. **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This TTP is directly related to ensuring an application starts automatically at boot or logon.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the question is closely related to the concept of persistence, specifically ensuring an application starts automatically at boot or logon. The fact that the attacker wants to maintain the functionality of the Welcome Chat app by auto-starting it at device boot also supports this conclusion.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker has already gained some level of access to the device, which is not explicitly stated in the question but can be inferred from the context.
2. The attacker wants to maintain the functionality of the Welcome Chat app, which implies that the app is already installed on the device.
3. To maintain the app's functionality, the attacker needs to ensure it starts automatically at device boot.
4. The related TTPs suggest that the attacker is using techniques related to persistence, specifically T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to persistence, which is the correct answer.
