Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving a coin miner saved on a host, and a script from TeamTNT that uses iplogger.org to track infected hosts and obtain their details. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this sequence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging: This suggests the collection of sensitive information, such as login credentials.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This involves gathering information about the system, which could be used to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service: This involves using web services for command and control, which could be used to track infected hosts.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the most relevant TTPs are related to discovery and collection. The use of iplogger.org to track infected hosts and obtain their details suggests that the attacker is collecting information about the hosts. The keylogging TTP (T1056.001) is also relevant, as it could be used to obtain sensitive information that would be useful for tracking and controlling the hosts.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit is not directly related to the described attack sequence.
- B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery is a plausible choice, as it involves discovering network connections, which could be used to identify potential hosts to infect.
- C: T1595-Active Scanning is also a plausible choice, as it involves scanning for hosts, which could be used to identify potential targets.
- D: T1087-Account Discovery is not directly related to the described attack sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is likely to involve discovering the hosts before tracking and controlling them. Between B and C, active scanning (T1595) is more likely to occur before tracking and controlling the hosts, as it involves actively searching for hosts, which would be a necessary step before using iplogger.org to track them.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker needs to identify potential hosts to infect.
2. Active scanning (T1595) would be a likely step to identify these hosts.
3. Once the hosts are identified, the attacker could use keylogging (T1056.001) to obtain sensitive information.
4. The attacker could then use this information to track the hosts using iplogger.org (T1102-Web Service).

Final Answer: C
