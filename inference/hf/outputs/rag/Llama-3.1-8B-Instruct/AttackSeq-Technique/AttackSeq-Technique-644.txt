To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where spear-phishing emails are used for initial access. After initial access is gained, the attackers, Moafee and DragonOK, deploy custom-built backdoors and publicly available Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to support their campaigns. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique best describes this activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (spear-phishing emails for initial access)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear-phishing links for initial access)
   - These TTPs indicate that the attackers used spear-phishing emails or links to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves using code signing certificates to make malware appear legitimate. While this could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly describe the deployment of backdoors and RATs.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining capabilities or tools to support an attack. Given the context of deploying custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs, this option seems plausible.
   - **C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique involves defacing a website or system, which doesn't match the description of deploying tools to support a campaign.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique used in the question, not the technique that describes the deployment of tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the attackers deploying tools (custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs) after initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails or links.
   - Based on the context, the most plausible technique that describes the deployment of tools to support the campaign is obtaining capabilities or tools to support the attack.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **Final Answer: B**
