Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where threat actors have successfully evaded defenses using Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls. This implies that they have compromised the system and are now attempting to gather information to further their objectives.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1484.002-Trust Modification: This suggests that the threat actors are attempting to modify trust relationships to gain elevated privileges.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading: This indicates that the threat actors are using masquerading techniques to evade detection.

Considering the context of the question and the related TTPs, the threat actors have already compromised the system and are now attempting to gather internal system information to further their objectives.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking: This technique involves hijacking a remote service session, which is not directly related to gathering internal system information.
- B: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system, which aligns with the goal of gathering internal system information.
- C: T1003.003-NTDS: This technique involves accessing the NTDS (Netlogon Database) to gather information, but it is more specific to Active Directory environments and not directly related to the general goal of gathering internal system information.
- D: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which is not directly related to gathering internal system information.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is gathering internal system information to further their objectives, which aligns with Technique T1057-Process Discovery.

Final Answer: B
