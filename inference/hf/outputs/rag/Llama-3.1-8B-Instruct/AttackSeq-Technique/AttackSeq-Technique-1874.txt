To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to evade detection and communicate with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated this communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service

   These TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, specifically focusing on web services and bidirectional communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which doesn't directly relate to the communication between malware and C2 servers through web services.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Obfuscation is a technique used to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the communication with C2 servers through web services.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography**: Steganography involves hiding data within other data, which is not directly related to the described scenario of using web services for C2 communication.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question mentions the use of legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) for C2 communication, which suggests the use of web services.
   - The related TTPs (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication and T1102-Web Service) also point towards web services being used for C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+ is the use of web services.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
