To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where FIN4 has stolen credentials through spearphishing emails and transmitted them to their C2 servers. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated their anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They are categorized into three tactics: Command and Control, Exfiltration, and Initial Access. The relevant techniques are:

- T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with C2 servers.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information: This technique is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.
B: T1590.002-DNS: This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication, but it's not the most likely choice given the context of web protocols.
C: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using proxies to hide communication, which could be a plausible choice for anonymous communication.
D: T1205.001-Port Knocking: This technique involves knocking on a port to establish a connection, which is not directly related to the context.

Given the context of web protocols (T1071.001) and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041), the most plausible choice is C: T1090-Proxy, as it involves hiding communication, which is likely used to maintain anonymity when communicating with C2 servers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. FIN4 has stolen credentials through spearphishing emails (T1566.002).
2. They transmitted the credentials to their C2 servers.
3. To maintain anonymity, they likely used a technique to hide their communication with the C2 servers.
4. Given the context of web protocols (T1071.001) and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041), the most plausible choice is a technique that involves hiding communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy**
