To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC (Command and Control) servers. The initial distribution of malware was through compromised websites.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, which is likely how the malware was initially distributed.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with compromised systems, which aligns with the use of multiple CnC servers.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication: This technique involves bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is a common requirement for CnC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule: This technique involves creating a rule to forward emails to a different address, which doesn't seem directly related to the use of multiple CnC servers.
   - Answer Choice B and C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution: This technique involves resolving a domain name to an IP address, which could be used to communicate with a CnC server. However, it's not the most specific technique for facilitating communication with multiple CnC servers.
   - Given the context of the question, the most relevant technique is T1104-Multi-Stage Channels, which involves using multiple channels to communicate with compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial distribution of malware was through compromised websites (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
   - The malware communicated with multiple CnC servers (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).
   - This technique is the most specific and relevant to the question.

Final Answer: C
