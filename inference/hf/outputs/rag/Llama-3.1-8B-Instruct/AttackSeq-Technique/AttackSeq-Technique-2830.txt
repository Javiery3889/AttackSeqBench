Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where BlackSoul has established communication with a C2 server using a specific protocol (RESTful Strapi) and data encoding (JSON-based). The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. The TTPs mention Exfiltration over C2 Channel (T1041) and Non-Application Layer Protocol (T1095). These TTPs suggest that the attack involves transferring data over a C2 channel using a protocol other than typical application-layer protocols.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket - This technique is related to Kerberos exploitation and doesn't seem relevant to the scenario described in the question.

B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not typically used for C2 communication. However, it doesn't specifically mention C2 channels.

C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves automated data exfiltration, but it's not specific to C2 channels or non-application layer protocols.

D: T1560-Archive Collected Data - This technique involves archiving collected data, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.

Based on the related TTPs, the most relevant technique is Exfiltration over C2 Channel (T1041). However, this option is not available in the answer choices. The closest match is B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol, which involves exfiltration over a non-C2 protocol, aligning with the T1095 Non-Application Layer Protocol TTP.

Final Answer: B
