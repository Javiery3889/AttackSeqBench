To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of techniques used by an attacker. The sequence starts with "Dropping Elephant" which is not a standard ATT&CK technique, but it seems to be related to the initial access technique. The attacker used spear-phishing emails with exploit documents for initial access. After that, the attacker employed encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware. We need to find the technique that occurred after the initial access and before the evasion technique.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling (not directly related to the question)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (related to the initial access technique)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (related to the initial access technique)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access techniques are spear-phishing links and attachments. Since the question mentions "Dropping Elephant" and spear-phishing emails with exploit documents, it is likely that the initial access technique is T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. The question asks for the technique that occurred after the initial access and before the evasion technique. The evasion technique is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs, but we can infer that it is related to T1027.006-HTML Smuggling.

However, the question specifically mentions "encoded blobs" which is not directly related to HTML Smuggling. A more likely evasion technique that involves encoded blobs is T1012- Sample the Domain Name System (DNS).
