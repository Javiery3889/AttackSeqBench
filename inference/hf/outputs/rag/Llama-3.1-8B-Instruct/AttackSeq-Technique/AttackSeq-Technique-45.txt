To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker initiating communication with a C2 server using HTTP connections and specific URIs, and then transferring stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the command and control infrastructure.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation (This TTP is related to the initial communication with the C2 server using HTTP connections and specific URIs.)
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (This TTP is related to transferring data to the command and control infrastructure.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial communication with the C2 server is related to Protocol or Service Impersonation (T1001.003), and the data transfer is related to Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041).

Considering the answer choices:

A: T1056-Input Capture is related to capturing user input, which is not directly related to the data transfer described in the question.

B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is related to exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol, which is not directly related to the C2 channel described in the question.

C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking is related to hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, which is not directly related to the data transfer described in the question.

D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most plausible answer choice, as it directly relates to transferring data to the command and control infrastructure, which is the final step in the attack sequence described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker initiates communication with the C2 server using HTTP connections and specific URIs, which is related to Protocol or Service Impersonation (T1001.003).
2. The attacker then transfers stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the command and control infrastructure, which is related to Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041).

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
