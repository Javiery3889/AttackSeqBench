To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the technique used by the TAIDOOR RAT to establish communication with its C2 servers after decrypting and executing the main malware in memory.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (This technique is related to using web protocols for C2 communication)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication (This technique is related to bidirectional communication between the attacker and the C2 server)
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (This technique is related to decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which is relevant to the decryption of the malware)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given that the TAIDOOR RAT decrypts and executes the main malware in memory, we can infer that the malware is likely using some form of communication to establish a connection with its C2 servers. The related TTPs suggest that the communication is likely bidirectional (T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication) and may involve web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

Considering the answer choices:

A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver - This technique is not directly related to bidirectional communication.
B: T1571-Non-Standard Port - This technique is related to using non-standard ports, but it's not directly related to the communication method used by the TAIDOOR RAT.
C: T1053.003-Cron - This technique is related to using cron jobs, which is not relevant to the communication method used by the TAIDOOR RAT.
D: T1204-User Execution - This technique is related to executing files or commands from user input, which is not directly related to the communication method used by the TAIDOOR RAT.

However, none of the answer choices directly match the related TTPs. But, considering the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is B: T1571-Non-Standard Port, as it is the only answer choice that could potentially be used for bidirectional communication, and the TAIDOOR RAT may use a non-standard port to communicate with its C2 servers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The TAIDOOR RAT decrypts and executes the main malware in memory.
2. The malware needs to establish communication with its C2 servers.
3. The related TTPs suggest that the communication is likely bidirectional and may involve web protocols.
4. The answer choices are evaluated, and B: T1571-Non-Standard Port is the most plausible answer, as it could be used for bidirectional communication.

**Final Answer: B**
