Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used by Sednit's downloaders and backdoors to establish communications with the C&C server. The key information is that the communications are encrypted and hex-encoded over commonly used ports.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This technique involves encoding data using standard encoding schemes, which could be relevant to the hex-encoding mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not directly relevant to the question but could be related to the use of "commonly used ports" in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution: This technique involves resolving a domain name to an IP address, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
- Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not relevant to the communication with the C&C server.
- Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel, which aligns with the encrypted data mentioned in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1547.012-Print Processors: This technique involves using print processors, which is not related to the communication with the C&C server.

Based on the related TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of techniques is establishing an encrypted channel before using it to communicate with the C&C server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the communications are encrypted and hex-encoded, which suggests that an encrypted channel is used.
2. The related TTP T1132.001-Standard Encoding is relevant to the hex-encoding mentioned in the question.
3. The question does not mention any non-standard ports, so T1571-Non-Standard Port is not directly relevant.
4. The other answer choices do not align with the information provided in the question.

Final Answer: C
