Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises were used to gain access to a target system, and customized Poison Ivy server code was executed on the system. This indicates that the attacker has already gained initial access to the system.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This indicates that phishing was used to gain initial access to the system.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This indicates that a spear-phishing attachment was used to gain initial access to the system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the attacker has already gained initial access to the system, the next step would likely involve executing malicious code on the compromised system. 

- Option A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management is related to remote management of Windows systems, which is not directly related to executing malicious code on a compromised system.
- Option B: T1199-Trusted Relationship is related to exploiting trusted relationships, which is not directly related to executing malicious code on a compromised system.
- Option C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution is related to executing malicious code in response to a specific event, which aligns with the scenario of customized Poison Ivy server code being executed on the target system.
- Option D: T1566-Phishing is the initial access technique, not the next step after gaining access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is executing malicious code on the compromised system in response to a specific event, which is described by T1546-Event Triggered Execution.

Final Answer: C
