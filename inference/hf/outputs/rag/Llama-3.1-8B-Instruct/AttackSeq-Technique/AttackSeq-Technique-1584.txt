To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attacker (T9000) communicating with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specific port, which implies the use of a non-standard port for communication.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using a non-standard port for communication, which aligns with the question's description of using a specific port.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for communication, which could be related to the use of a binary protocol.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves encrypting communication, but it doesn't necessarily involve using a non-standard port or protocol.
   - Answer Choice B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation: This technique involves using DNS for malicious purposes, which is not directly related to the use of a non-standard port or protocol.
   - Answer Choice C: T1123-Audio Capture: This technique involves capturing audio, which is unrelated to the communication described in the question.
   - Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is not directly related to the use of a non-standard port or protocol.

Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events would involve using a non-standard port (T1571-Non-Standard Port) before communicating with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port.

Final Answer: A
