To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Dridex employs heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection. It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to communicate data with its true Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1497.003-Time Based Evasion: This technique is related to evading detection by using time-based evasion techniques, which is not directly relevant to the question.
   - T1071.004-DNS: This technique is related to using DNS to communicate with C2 servers, but the question specifies POST requests, not DNS.
   - T1001-Data Obfuscation: This technique is related to the obfuscation used by Dridex to evade detection, but it's not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application-layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers. Given that the question mentions encrypted POST requests, this technique seems like a good fit.
   - **B: T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique is related to evading debuggers, which is not relevant to the question.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way, which is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique is related to gathering information about the victim's physical location, which is not relevant to the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question mentions Dridex employing heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection, which aligns with T1001-Data Obfuscation.
   - The question asks about communicating data with C2 servers via encrypted POST requests, which aligns with using an application-layer protocol.
   - Given the information, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible technique used by Dridex to communicate with its C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
