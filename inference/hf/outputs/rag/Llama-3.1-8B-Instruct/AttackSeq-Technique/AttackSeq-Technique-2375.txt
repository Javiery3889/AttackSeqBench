Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where malware uses defense evasion techniques, specifically self-deletion on a hardcoded date, to avoid detection. After evading detection, the malware collects detailed information about system properties. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the reconnaissance phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion (self-deletion on a hardcoded date)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery (collecting system properties)

Comparison and Evaluation:
The question describes the malware evading detection and then collecting system properties. The related TTPs indicate that the malware used self-deletion to evade detection and then used T1082-System Information Discovery to collect system properties. 

Considering the answer choices:
- A: T1070-Indicator Removal is incorrect because it refers to removing indicators of compromise, not collecting system properties.
- B: T1082-System Information Discovery is the correct answer because it matches the related TTPs and the scenario described in the question.
- C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook is incorrect because it refers to exfiltrating data over a webhook, which is not related to collecting system properties.
- D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery is incorrect because it refers to collecting browser information, which is not mentioned in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the malware evading detection using self-deletion on a hardcoded date.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the malware used T1070.004-File Deletion for defense evasion.
3. After evading detection, the malware collected system properties.
4. The related TTPs indicate that the malware used T1082-System Information Discovery to collect system properties.
5. Based on the scenario and related TTPs, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred during the reconnaissance phase is T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: B
