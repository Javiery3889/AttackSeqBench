To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT-TOCS evaded detection, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes APT-TOCS evading detection by executing malicious code in memory without any hard disk activity and running multi-beacon communication. This suggests that the adversary is using techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- T1497.003-Time Based Evasion: This technique involves using timing-based evasion to avoid detection.
- T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process.
- T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a running process.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques involve evasion and process injection. To evade detection and execute malicious code in memory without any hard disk activity, the adversary would likely inject malicious code into a running process. This would allow them to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The adversary would first need to inject malicious code into a running process to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This is consistent with T1055-Process Injection.
2. Once the malicious code is injected, the adversary can execute it in memory without any hard disk activity, evading detection.
3. The adversary can then use multi-beacon communication to maintain communication with their command and control (C2) server.

**Final Answer: T1055-Process Injection**
