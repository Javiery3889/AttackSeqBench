To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl.' This implies that the technique in question is related to gaining access to the systems before executing commands.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a network.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.004-Unix Shell: This technique involves using a Unix shell to execute commands.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell: This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the Tuyul botnet is using Unix and Windows shells to execute commands. This suggests that the botnet has already gained access to the systems. The question asks about the technique that occurred before this execution.

Considering the related TTPs, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most likely technique that occurred before the execution of commands. This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a network, which would allow the Tuyul botnet to execute commands on the victim systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl.'
2. This implies that the botnet had access to the systems before executing the commands.
3. The related TTPs include T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, which involves gaining access to a network.
4. This technique is the most likely to have occurred before the execution of commands.

**Final Answer: B: T1133-External Remote Services**
