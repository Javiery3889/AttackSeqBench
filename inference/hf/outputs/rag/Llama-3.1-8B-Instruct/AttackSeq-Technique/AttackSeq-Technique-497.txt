To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of events where payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor. After that, a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection was used to inject the final payload DLL into memory. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this sequence.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

1. T1620-Reflective Code Loading: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which is relevant to the PowerShell loader used in the question.
2. T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process, which is also relevant to the PowerShell loader used in the question.
3. T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is similar to the DLL injection mentioned in T1055.001.
4. T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the attacker's IP address, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
5. T1587.003-Digital Certificates: This technique involves using digital certificates to authenticate or encrypt data, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
6. T1129-Shared Modules: This technique involves using shared modules to execute code, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
7. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job: This technique involves using scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code, which is relevant to the payload stagers being executed using scheduled tasks in the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is the most relevant technique to the sequence of events described in the question. The question states that payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor, which is a clear indication of T1053-Scheduled Task/Job. The other techniques, while related to the overall attack, do not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a sequence of events where payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor.
2. The related TTPs include T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, which is directly related to the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks.
3. The other techniques, while related to the overall attack, do not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
