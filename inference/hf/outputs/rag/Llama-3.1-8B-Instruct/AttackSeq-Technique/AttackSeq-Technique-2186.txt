To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers first use social engineering tactics to send malicious documents with a Taiwan theme. This is likely a spearphishing attack, as it targets a specific region or theme.
   - The attackers then exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft and Adobe applications to gain initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious links to trick victims into clicking on them.
     - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to trick victims into opening them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes the attackers using malicious documents, which aligns with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - The question also mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft and Adobe applications to gain initial access, which is a common outcome of opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first used social engineering tactics to send malicious documents, which is consistent with T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment.
   - The attackers then exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft and Adobe applications, which is a likely outcome of opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment to send malicious documents, which led to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft and Adobe applications to gain initial access.

Final Answer: D
