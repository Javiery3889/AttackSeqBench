To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes APT28's actions after deploying a backdoor component (advstoreshell.dll) indicated in a configuration file during data collection. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C2 servers.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context about APT28's tactics and techniques. They include:

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer (This TTP is related to data collection, which is mentioned in the question.)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication (This TTP is related to communication between the attacker and their C2 servers.)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels (This TTP is related to alternative communication channels, which could be used for secure communication.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1569-System Services - This technique is related to the exploitation of system services, which is not directly related to secure communication with C2 servers.

B: T1071.001-Web Protocols - This technique is related to the use of web protocols for C2 communication, but it's not the most likely choice since the question mentions a backdoor component and a configuration file.

C: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is related to the use of encrypted channels for communication, which aligns with the idea of secure communication with C2 servers.

D: T1218.014-MMC - This technique is related to the use of Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for C2 communication, but it's not the most likely choice since the question doesn't mention MMC.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. APT28 deployed a backdoor component (advstoreshell.dll) indicated in a configuration file during data collection.
2. The goal is to facilitate secure communication with their C2 servers.
3. The related TTPs suggest that APT28 uses bidirectional communication (T1102.002) and fallback channels (T1008) for C2 communication.
4. The most plausible technique for secure communication is the use of an encrypted channel (T1573).

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
