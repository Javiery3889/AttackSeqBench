To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where Mustang Panda uses spearphished '.lnk' files to deliver payloads like Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves delivering a malicious file to a victim's system.
2. T1204.001-Malicious Link: This technique involves deceiving a user into clicking on a malicious link.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attack involves delivering malicious files and links to deceive users. The question specifically asks for the technique that occurred to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

- Option A, T1036-Masquerading, involves making a file or process appear as a legitimate one, but it's not directly related to deceiving users into executing a malicious file.
- Option B, T1070.006-Timestomp, involves modifying timestamps to make a file appear as if it was created or modified at a different time, which is not relevant to the scenario.
- Option C, T1647-Plist File Modification, involves modifying a property list file, which is not related to the scenario.
- Option D, T1566-Phishing, involves deceiving users into performing a specific action, such as clicking on a link or executing a file, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attack scenario where users are deceived into executing malicious '.lnk' files.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves delivering malicious files and links to deceive users.
3. Option D, T1566-Phishing, is the only technique that directly involves deceiving users into performing a specific action, such as clicking on a link or executing a file.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
