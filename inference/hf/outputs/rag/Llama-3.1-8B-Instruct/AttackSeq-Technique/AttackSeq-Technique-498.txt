Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of techniques used in the CostaRicto Campaign, specifically focusing on the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor (SombRAT). The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the payload stagers were executed but before the process discovery and system information discovery functionalities of the SombRicto backdoor were utilized.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task

These TTPs indicate that the attackers used scheduled tasks (T1053.005) to execute payload stagers, which is consistent with the question. The process discovery technique (T1057) is also related to the discovery of system information, which is mentioned in the question as a functionality of the SombRAT backdoor.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we need to find a technique that fits between the execution of payload stagers using scheduled tasks and the process discovery and system information discovery functionalities of the SombRAT backdoor.

- Option A (T1078.004-Cloud Accounts) is not directly related to the execution of payload stagers or the discovery of system information.
- Option B (T1546.010-AppInit DLLs) is a technique related to persistence, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- Option C (T1055-Process Injection) is a technique that involves injecting code into a process, which could be a plausible step after executing payload stagers and before utilizing the process discovery and system information discovery functionalities of the SombRAT backdoor.
- Option D (T1001-Data Obfuscation) is a technique related to evasion, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of techniques is that the attackers injected code into a process (T1055-Process Injection) after executing payload stagers using scheduled tasks, but before utilizing the process discovery and system information discovery functionalities of the SombRAT backdoor.

Final Answer: C
