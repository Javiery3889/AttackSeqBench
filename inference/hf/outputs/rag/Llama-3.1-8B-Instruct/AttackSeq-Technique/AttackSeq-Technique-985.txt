Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker, starting with gathering system information using the InfoOS module and then listing installed applications and iPhone backups for Discovery. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery

These TTPs are related to the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the target system. T1082-System Information Discovery involves gathering system information, and T1518-Software Discovery involves gathering information about installed software.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attacker is gathering information about the target system. The question mentions that the InfoOS module gathered system information and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups. This suggests that the attacker is gathering information about the system and its software.

Considering the answer choices:
A: T1090-Proxy - This technique involves creating a proxy server to intercept and manipulate traffic. It does not seem directly related to gathering system or software information.
B: T1057-Process Discovery - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on the system. While it is related to system information, it is not the most direct next step after gathering system information and listing installed applications.
C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture - This technique involves capturing user input from the GUI. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
D: T1040-Network Sniffing - This technique involves intercepting and analyzing network traffic. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

However, T1518-Software Discovery is related to listing installed applications, which is mentioned in the question. Therefore, the most plausible next step would be to gather more information about the software installed on the system.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after gathering system information and listing installed applications would be to gather more information about the software installed on the system.

Final Answer: B
