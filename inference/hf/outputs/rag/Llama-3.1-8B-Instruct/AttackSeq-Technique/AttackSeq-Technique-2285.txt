Analysis of the Question:
The question describes the Regin malware's discovery phase, where it gathers information on processes, memory utilization, and monitors network traffic. This suggests that the malware is actively gathering information about the system and its environment.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the discovery phase of the Regin malware.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking: This technique is related to evading detection by blocking indicators, but it's not directly related to the discovery phase.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about running processes, which is also related to the discovery phase.

Given the context of the question, the next step in the attack sequence would likely involve gathering more information about the system or its processes.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server: This technique is related to creating a virtual private server, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
- B: T1110.001-Password Guessing: This technique involves guessing passwords, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
- C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
- D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over alternative protocols, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.

However, T1057-Process Discovery is the most relevant technique to the discovery phase of the Regin malware, as it involves gathering information about running processes, which aligns with the information gathered by the malware during its discovery phase.

Final Answer: T1057-Process Discovery
