To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question describes a sequence of actions involving exploitation of CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation and the use of GitHub gists for discovery.
    - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure the SLUB backdoor remained active upon system startup.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs include techniques for Privilege Escalation, specifically Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068) and Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001).
    - These TTPs are relevant to the question as they relate to the exploitation and persistence of a backdoor.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - Answer Choice A (T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication) is unrelated to the persistence of a backdoor and is actually a technique for authentication.
    - Answer Choice B (T1546.010-AppInit DLLs) is a technique for persistence, but it involves loading a DLL at application initialization, which is not directly related to the SLUB backdoor.
    - Answer Choice C (T1113-Screen Capture) is a technique for data collection and is not relevant to the persistence of a backdoor.
    - Answer Choice D (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is a technique for persistence, specifically involving the execution of a process at boot or logon, which aligns with the requirement for the SLUB backdoor to remain active upon system startup.

4.  Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
    - The question describes a sequence of actions involving exploitation and persistence of a backdoor.
    - The related TTPs indicate that the focus is on Privilege Escalation and persistence.
    - Answer Choice D (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs as it involves ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup, which aligns with the requirement for persistence.

Final Answer: D
