To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where Volatile Cedar uses keylogging capabilities for credential access. After gaining access, the campaign connects with a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs in this scenario.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging (keylogging capabilities for credential access)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (connecting with a multi-tiered server backend framework)
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging (redundant information, but still relevant to the initial access)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access is achieved through keylogging (T1056.001-Keylogging). The next step is to connect with a multi-tiered server backend framework, which is a characteristic of multi-stage channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels). This suggests that the campaign is using a complex command and control infrastructure to control the targeted systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Volatile Cedar uses keylogging capabilities for credential access (T1056.001-Keylogging).
2. The campaign connects with a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems, which is a characteristic of multi-stage channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).

**Final Answer: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
