To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes APT42 using application layer protocols and encrypted channels to maintain communication with compromised systems. This implies that the attackers are using techniques to establish a command and control (C2) channel with the compromised systems.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics and techniques. Specifically, they involve using various protocols and channels to maintain communication with compromised systems.

- T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a C2 channel.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain communication with compromised systems.
- T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols to establish a C2 channel.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a technique that would occur after establishing a C2 channel using application layer protocols and encrypted channels. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution: This technique involves resolving a domain name to an IP address, which is not directly related to maintaining a C2 channel.

B: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using web services to establish a C2 channel, which is a plausible next step after using application layer protocols and encrypted channels.

C: T1587-Develop Capabilities: This technique involves developing new capabilities, which is not directly related to maintaining a C2 channel.

D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature: This technique involves using invalid code signatures, which is not directly related to maintaining a C2 channel.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after using application layer protocols and encrypted channels to maintain communication with compromised systems is to use web services to establish a C2 channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. APT42 used application layer protocols to establish a C2 channel with compromised systems (T1071).
2. To maintain communication with the compromised systems, APT42 used encrypted channels (T1573).
3. To further maintain the C2 channel, APT42 used web services (T1102).

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
