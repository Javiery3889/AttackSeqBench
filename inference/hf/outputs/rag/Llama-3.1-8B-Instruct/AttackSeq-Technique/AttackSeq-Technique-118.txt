To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by Agrius to ensure command execution and minimize detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service: This TTP is related to the initial deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which suggests that Agrius used a Windows service to achieve persistence.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary: This TTP is also related to persistence, but it involves compromising a host software binary, which is not directly related to the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service: This TTP is related to privilege escalation, which is a common step after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands, which could be a plausible way to ensure command execution after achieving persistence.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to ensuring command execution.
   - **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor or ensuring command execution.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly, which could be a plausible way to minimize detection after achieving persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Agrius achieved persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which is a Windows service (T1543.003-Windows Service).
   - To ensure command execution and minimize detection, Agrius would likely use a technique that allows for indirect command execution, as it would be more difficult to detect than direct command execution.
   - Based on the related TTPs, **T1202-Indirect Command Execution** is the most plausible technique for ensuring command execution and minimizing detection after achieving persistence.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Final Answer: D
