Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Turla group, which includes leveraging PowerShell to run malware directly in memory for execution and then encrypting payloads to evade detection. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the first action and before the second action.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

Reflective Code Loading (T1620) is a technique used for Defense Evasion, where an attacker loads malicious code into memory without writing it to disk. This is often used to evade detection by traditional signature-based detection systems. PowerShell (T1059.001) is a technique used for Execution, where an attacker uses PowerShell to execute malicious code.

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- A: T1546-Event Triggered Execution: This technique is related to Execution and involves executing code in response to a specific event. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- B: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: This technique is related to Privilege Escalation and involves modifying cloud compute infrastructure. It does not relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- C: T1137-Office Application Startup: This technique is related to Execution and involves executing malicious code when an office application starts. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery: This technique is related to Reconnaissance and involves discovering peripheral devices. It does not relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of actions would involve loading malicious code into memory using PowerShell (T1059.001) and then evading detection by encrypting payloads. Reflective Code Loading (T1620) is a technique used for Defense Evasion, which fits the sequence of actions described in the question.

Final Answer: D.
