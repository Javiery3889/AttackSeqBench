To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Turla malware has already utilized encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade defenses and hide its tracks. The attackers are now gathering specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all related to Defense Evasion techniques. Specifically, they involve hiding files, directories, or file systems to evade detection. This context suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain their presence on the system without being detected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe**: This technique involves wiping the contents of a disk, which is not directly related to gathering information from systems.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves gathering data from network shared drives, which is a possible way to gather information, but it's not directly related to the context of the question, which focuses on gathering information from systems after evading defenses.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which could be a possible way to gather specific information from systems. However, it's not the most direct or likely technique given the context of the question.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as a capability used by the Turla malware to evade defenses. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred as the attackers began gathering specific information from systems, not the technique used for evasion.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique that aligns with gathering specific information from systems after evading defenses is **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**. This is because the attackers have already used rootkit capabilities to evade defenses and hide their tracks, and now they need to gather specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

**Final Answer: C**
