To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques used in Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on credential harvesting. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely captured credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link
   - These TTPs indicate that the attackers used spearphishing links to gather credentials and then used web portal capture to log victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves manipulating or exploiting application-layer protocols. While it could be related to the scenario, it's not directly related to logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages. This is a strong candidate for the correct answer.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography, which is unrelated to logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - **D: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This technique involves using password spraying, which is a different tactic from logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Based on the related TTPs, the attackers used spearphishing links to gather credentials and then used web portal capture to log victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - The correct answer choice is the one that aligns with logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is B: T1056-Input Capture.

Final Answer: B
