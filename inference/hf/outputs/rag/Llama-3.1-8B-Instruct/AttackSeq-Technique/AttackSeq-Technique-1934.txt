To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an infection sequence involving sysOptimizer.bat collecting personal files and sysCrt32.exe initializing execution components. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer collected data securely to the FTP servers.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging

These TTPs are related to data collection and exfiltration, which are relevant to the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves the transfer of data from a system to an external location, which aligns with the question's description of transferring collected data to FTP servers.

B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to execute a command or process, but it doesn't directly relate to data transfer.

C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files - This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the question's description of data transfer.

D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, but it's not the most specific match for transferring data to FTP servers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question describes an infection sequence involving data collection and transfer.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves data collection and exfiltration.
3. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique for transferring collected data to an external location, such as FTP servers.

**Final Answer: A**
