To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used by an attacker, specifically what technique occurred after the attacker performed reconnaissance on the target networks.
   - The attacker used the NodeIISWeb malware to intercept HTTP requests on the server, which suggests the use of a web protocol for command and control (C2).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This suggests the use of web protocols for C2.
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery: This indicates the attacker discovered the target's internet connection.
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing: This suggests the attacker sniffed the network to gather information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the use of web protocols for C2 and the fact that the attacker intercepted HTTP requests, we can infer that the attacker likely exploited a public-facing application to gain access to the network.
   - Answer choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the most plausible sequence of TTPs, as it aligns with the use of web protocols for C2 and the exploitation of a public-facing application.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attacker performed reconnaissance on the target networks using techniques like internet connection discovery and network sniffing (T1016.001 and T1040).
   - The attacker then exploited a public-facing application (T1190) to gain access to the network.
   - After gaining access, the attacker maintained persistence using the NodeIISWeb malware to intercept HTTP requests on the server (T1071.001).

5. **Final Answer:** 
   Final Answer: B
