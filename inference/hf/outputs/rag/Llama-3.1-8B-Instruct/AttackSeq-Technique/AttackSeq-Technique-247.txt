To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker executing CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to evade detection. The goal is to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location (disguising the malware as a legitimate process)
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service (masquerading as a legitimate task or service)

These TTPs indicate that the attacker is using techniques to evade detection by making the malware appear legitimate.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, the attacker has already used T1036.005 to disguise the malware as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'. To maintain persistence, the attacker would likely use a technique that allows the malware to run repeatedly without being detected.

- A: T1571-Non-Standard Port is not directly related to maintaining persistence through repeated executions.
- B: T1505.003-Web Shell is not relevant to the scenario, as it involves creating a web shell on a compromised system.
- C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a plausible choice, as it allows the attacker to schedule the malware to run repeatedly, maintaining persistence.
- D: T1583.007-Serverless is not relevant to the scenario, as it involves using serverless computing to execute malicious code.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker has already used T1036.005 to disguise the malware as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
2. To maintain persistence, the attacker needs a technique that allows the malware to run repeatedly without being detected.
3. T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is a technique that allows the attacker to schedule the malware to run at regular intervals, maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
