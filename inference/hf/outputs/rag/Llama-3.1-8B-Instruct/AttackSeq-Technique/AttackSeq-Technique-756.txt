To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where a malicious XLS macro downloads and installs the SunSeed malware, which then connects to an actor-controlled staging server. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to ensure the SunSeed malware runs automatically at Windows Startup.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (This TTP is related to the communication between the malware and the actor-controlled staging server.)
2. Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (This TTP is related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.)
3. Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (This TTP is also related to ensuring the malware runs at startup.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that both T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution techniques are related to ensuring the malware runs at startup. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred after the execution step involving the malicious XLS macro. Given this context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the malware being installed and then configured to run at startup.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malicious XLS macro executes and downloads/install SunSeed malware.
2. The malware establishes a connection to the actor-controlled staging server (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).
3. To ensure the malware runs automatically at Windows Startup, the actor uses T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
