To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where adversaries have already gained valid credentials to access the target network. They are now moving across the network to further their objectives. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur in this situation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs indicate that the adversaries have already gained initial access through valid accounts (T1078-Valid Accounts) and are now moving across the network. This suggests that the adversaries are using legitimate access to expand their presence within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages to move laterally within a network. While it's a plausible option, it's not the most direct method of moving across the network using valid credentials.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**: This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies to gain unauthorized access. However, the question states that the adversaries already have valid credentials, so modifying policies is not necessary.
   - **C: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network. While it's a possibility, the question doesn't specify cloud services as the primary means of movement.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting remote services to move laterally within a network. However, the question states that the adversaries have valid credentials, making exploitation unnecessary.

Considering the related TTPs and the scenario described, the most plausible technique is **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**. This is because the adversaries are using valid credentials to move across the network, which aligns with the use of multi-stage channels to expand their presence.

**Final Answer: A**
