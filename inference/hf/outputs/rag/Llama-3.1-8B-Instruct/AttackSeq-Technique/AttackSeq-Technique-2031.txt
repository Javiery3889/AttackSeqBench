To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker (Duke group) securely communicating with their C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels. After this, they archived and transmitted sensitive information using legitimate cloud services. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this process.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. We have two related TTPs:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols - This TTP indicates the use of web protocols for command and control communication.
2. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This TTP suggests exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one used for C2 communication. However, the question does not specify an alternative protocol, and the related TTPs do not support this choice.

B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository - This technique involves accessing data from a configuration repository, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.

C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services for transmitting sensitive information. The related TTP T1071.001-Web Protocols also supports this choice, as it indicates the use of web protocols for C2 communication.

D: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts - This technique involves using cloud accounts for malicious activities, but it does not specifically describe the exfiltration of data.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes the Duke group securely communicating with their C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
2. The question then mentions archiving and transmitting sensitive information using legitimate cloud services, which suggests exfiltration over a web service.
3. Based on the related TTPs, T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is the most plausible choice, as it involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
