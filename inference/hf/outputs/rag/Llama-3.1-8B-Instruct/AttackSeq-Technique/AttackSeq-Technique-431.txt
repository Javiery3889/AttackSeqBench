Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving a Delphi downloader that gathers system information and sends it to a C&C server. The question asks about the technique that secures communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics and techniques. Specifically, they involve techniques for establishing and maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised system. 

- T1071.001-Web Protocols is a technique for using web protocols to communicate with the C2 server.
- T1008-Fallback Channels is a technique for establishing a secondary communication channel in case the primary channel is disrupted.
- T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography is a technique for encrypting communication using symmetric cryptography.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the focus is on securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server. The most relevant technique from the related TTPs is T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography, which involves encrypting communication using symmetric cryptography. This would be a common method for securing communication between a backdoor and a C&C server.

Answer Choice A (T1595-Active Scanning) is not relevant to securing communication, but rather to reconnaissance. Answer Choice C (T1071.004-DNS) is a technique for using DNS to communicate with the C&C server, but it does not necessarily secure the communication. Answer Choice D (T1574-Hijack Execution Flow) is a technique for hijacking the execution flow of a process, which is not relevant to securing communication.

Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
