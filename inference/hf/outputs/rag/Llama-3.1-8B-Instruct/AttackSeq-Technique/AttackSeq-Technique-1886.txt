To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker staging data collected from network shared drives and archiving it with specific utilities. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that enabled the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They are:

1. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging - This TTP involves staging data collected from a remote location.
2. Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer - This TTP involves transferring tools within the network.
3. Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive - This TTP involves collecting data from network shared drives.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker is collecting data from network shared drives (T1039) and staging it remotely (T1074.002). The next step would likely involve transferring tools within the network (T1570) to enable further communication and actions.

Considering the answer choices:

A: T1090-Proxy - This technique involves creating a proxy to hide the attacker's identity, which is not directly related to the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition - This technique involves adding a dynamic link library (DLL) to a process, which is not directly related to the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

C: T1021-Remote Services - This technique involves establishing a remote service to enable communication, which aligns with the lateral movement and tool transfer described in the related TTPs.

D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure - This technique involves hiding the attacker's infrastructure, which is not directly related to the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker collects data from network shared drives (T1039).
2. The attacker stages the collected data remotely (T1074.002).
3. To enable further communication and actions, the attacker needs to transfer tools within the network (T1570).
4. To facilitate this transfer, the attacker likely established a remote service to enable communication (T1021).

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
