Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker collecting sensitive information from an iOS device and then sending it out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix. This indicates that the attacker is encoding the data to conceal its content and possibly evade detection.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132-Data Encoding

These TTPs are related to encoding data, which is a common technique used in Command and Control (C2) operations to conceal malicious data from detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice as follows:

A: T1614-System Location Discovery - This technique is related to gathering system location information, which is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.

B: T1132-Data Encoding - This technique is directly related to encoding data, which matches the action described in the question. The question mentions sending the information out via Base64 encoded tokens, which is a form of data encoding.

C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting - This technique is related to using a third-party domain to hide malicious activity, which is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.

D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools - This technique is related to compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to encoding data, which is described in answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
