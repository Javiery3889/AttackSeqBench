To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where Grabit malware downloads itself via a malicious macro from a compromised remote server. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely happened to maintain persistence on the infected system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task - This TTP is related to maintaining persistence on the infected system by using scheduled tasks.
2. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This TTP is related to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
3. Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This TTP is related to maintaining persistence on the infected system by executing malware at boot or logon.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1008-Fallback Channels - This TTP is related to using fallback channels for communication, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.

B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This TTP is directly related to maintaining persistence on the infected system by executing malware at boot or logon, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

C: T1546.011-Application Shimming - This TTP is related to modifying the behavior of a legitimate application, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.

D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association - This TTP is related to changing the default file association, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a scenario where Grabit malware downloads itself via a malicious macro from a compromised remote server.
2. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely happened to maintain persistence on the infected system.
3. Based on the related TTPs, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique for maintaining persistence on the infected system.
4. This technique is directly related to executing malware at boot or logon, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
