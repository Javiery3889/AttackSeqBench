To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes GreyEnergy operators using Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials, and then redirecting requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.002-External Proxy: This technique involves using an external proxy to redirect requests for stealthy communication.
   - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool: This technique involves using tools to support the attack.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect requests for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management: This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to access remote systems. While it's a way to access remote systems, it doesn't directly relate to the use of internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.
   - Answer Choice B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. While it's a way to gain access, it doesn't directly relate to the use of internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.
   - Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting public-facing applications to gain access to a system. While it's a way to gain access, it doesn't directly relate to the use of internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.
   - Answer Choice D: T1070.004-File Deletion: This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks. While it's a way to cover tracks, it doesn't directly relate to the use of internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.

Based on the related TTPs, the most relevant technique is T1090-Proxy, which involves using a proxy to redirect requests for command and control. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before the use of internal C&C proxies. The use of tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials is likely a precursor to the use of a proxy for command and control.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used tools (T1588.002-Tool) to gain necessary credentials, and then used those credentials to exploit a remote service (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) to gain access to the system. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before the use of internal C&C proxies, which is more directly related to T1090-Proxy.

However, the most plausible answer choice that fits the sequence of TTPs described in the question is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, as it is the most likely technique that occurred before the use of internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.

Final Answer: B
