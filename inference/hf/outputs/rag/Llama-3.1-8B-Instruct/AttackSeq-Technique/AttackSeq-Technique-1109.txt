To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving exploitation of an Exchange Server via ProxyLogon, uploading a webshell for high-privilege code execution, and then creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (this is the initial exploitation of the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon)
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service (this is the creation of a Windows system service for persistence)
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service (this is related to the creation of a Windows system service, which is also relevant to the question)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after exploiting the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon and uploading a webshell for high-privilege code execution.
   - The exploitation of the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon and uploading a webshell for high-privilege code execution is related to T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence, which is related to T1543.003-Windows Service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step is the exploitation of the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon, which is related to T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - The next step is the uploading of a webshell for high-privilege code execution, which is not directly listed in the related TTPs but is a common step after exploitation.
   - The final step is the creation of a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence, which is related to T1543.003-Windows Service.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - Exploitation of the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services)
     - Uploading a webshell for high-privilege code execution (not directly listed, but a common step after exploitation)
     - Creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service)
   - However, the question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after exploiting the Exchange Server via ProxyLogon and uploading a webshell for high-privilege code execution. Therefore, the correct answer is the technique that is most closely related to the next step in the attack sequence, which is creating a Windows system service for persistence.

   Final Answer: C: T1543.003-Windows Service
