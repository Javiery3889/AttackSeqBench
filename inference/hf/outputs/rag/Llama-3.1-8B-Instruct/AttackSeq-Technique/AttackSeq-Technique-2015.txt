To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins to conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions to identify targets within corporate networks. Later, they enumerated all networked devices on the ICS network. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after these actions.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing
2. Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing
3. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery

These TTPs are related to network discovery and sniffing, which are relevant to the question. However, they don't directly indicate the next step in the attack sequence.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, the adversaries have already conducted credential harvesting and network discovery functions using BlackEnergy 3 plugins. The next logical step would be to enumerate the networked devices on the ICS network to identify potential targets for further exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins to conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
2. The next step would be to enumerate the networked devices on the ICS network to identify potential targets.
3. The technique that best fits this step is T1087.004-Cloud Account is not relevant in this context, as the question is about ICS network enumeration.
4. T1595-Active Scanning and T1018-Remote System Discovery are related to network discovery, but they are not the most specific technique for enumerating networked devices on an ICS network.
5. T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance is not directly related to network enumeration.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversaries enumerated all networked devices on the ICS network using a technique that is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs. However, the closest match is T1087.004 is not the best fit, but T1018-Remote System Discovery is the closest match as it is a technique that involves enumerating networked devices.

However, the best answer is not listed, but the closest match is T1018-Remote System Discovery.
