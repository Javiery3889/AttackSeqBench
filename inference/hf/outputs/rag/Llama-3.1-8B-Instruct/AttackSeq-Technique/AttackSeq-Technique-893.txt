To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes APT28's attack sequence, which involves harvesting credentials via spear-phishing and employing OLDBAIT. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks following the exploitation of internet-facing servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting internet-facing servers)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts (using valid accounts for further access)
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials (harvesting credentials via spear-phishing and OLDBAIT)

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions exploiting internet-facing servers, which aligns with T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application. This technique is a good starting point for the attack sequence.
   - The question also mentions harvesting credentials via spear-phishing and OLDBAIT, which aligns with T1589.001-Credentials.
   - To move deeper into the network, APT28 likely used the valid accounts obtained from the credentials to gain further access, which aligns with T1078-Valid Accounts.

However, the question asks about the technique that allowed APT28 to move deeper into the network following the exploitation of internet-facing servers. The exploitation of internet-facing servers is the initial step, and the subsequent step would be to use the obtained access to move deeper into the network.

Considering the ATT&CK techniques, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most likely technique that allowed APT28 to move deeper into the network. This technique involves using the access obtained from the initial exploitation to gain further access to the network.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - APT28 exploited internet-facing servers using T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
   - They harvested credentials via spear-phishing and OLDBAIT using T1589.001-Credentials.
   - They used the valid accounts obtained from the credentials to gain further access, which aligns with T1078-Valid Accounts.
   - To move deeper into the network, they likely used the access obtained from the initial exploitation to gain further access, which aligns with T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

Final Answer: A
