To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT37 avoided detection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: APT37 used compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service providers for their command and control (C2) infrastructure to avoid detection. This implies that they have already established a C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts: This indicates that APT37 used cloud accounts for evasion, which aligns with the use of cloud service providers for C2 infrastructure.
   - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1584.004-Server: This suggests that APT37 compromised servers, which is also mentioned in the question.
   - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.003-Cloud Accounts: This further supports the use of cloud accounts for C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2, which is not directly related to the use of compromised servers and cloud service providers.
   - **B: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to the use of cloud service providers or compromised servers for C2.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to bypass security controls, which could be a plausible next step after establishing a C2 channel using compromised servers and cloud service providers.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing certain actions, which is not directly related to the use of compromised servers and cloud service providers for C2.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after APT37 avoided detection by leveraging compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service providers for their C2 infrastructure is to use protocol tunneling to maintain a secure and stealthy C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
