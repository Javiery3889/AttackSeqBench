To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where malware made a POST request to a C2 domain, and the goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (This TTP is related to the initial communication between the malware and the C2 domain, which is a POST request.)
2. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (This TTP is related to the transfer of tools or payloads from the C2 domain to the compromised system.)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial communication between the malware and the C2 domain is facilitated by T1071.001-Web Protocols. However, the question asks about the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains, which is more closely related to T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malware made a POST request to the C2 domain, which is facilitated by T1071.001-Web Protocols.
2. The goal is to identify the technique that facilitated the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.
3. Based on the related TTPs, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant technique for the transfer of tools or payloads.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
