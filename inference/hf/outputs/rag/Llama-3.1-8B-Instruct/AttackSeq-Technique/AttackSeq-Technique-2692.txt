To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where Elfin (a threat actor) exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) on unpatched systems to ensure code execution. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this exploitation.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution (Execution Tactic): This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on a client-side system.
- T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access Tactic): This technique involves using spear-phishing links to gain initial access to a system.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we need to find a technique that precedes the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250. 

- Option A (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) is not directly related to the exploitation of a vulnerability on a client-side system.
- Option B (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is a related technique, but the question specifically mentions spear-phishing links (T1566.002), not attachments.
- Option C (T1562-Impair Defenses) is a technique that could potentially occur before exploitation, but it is not directly related to the exploitation of a vulnerability.
- Option D (T1027.014-Polymorphic Code) is a technique related to code execution, but it is not directly related to the exploitation of a vulnerability.

However, T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access Tactic) is the most likely precursor to the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250, as it involves gaining initial access to a system, which could lead to the exploitation of a vulnerability.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question describes an attack sequence where Elfin exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) to ensure code execution.
2. The related TTPs include T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, which is the technique being used to exploit the vulnerability.
3. T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is the most likely precursor to the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250, as it involves gaining initial access to a system, which could lead to the exploitation of a vulnerability.

**Final Answer: B**
