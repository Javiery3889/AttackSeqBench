Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where malicious payloads are deployed in the background during the execution phase, and the initial access was enabled using embedded '.lnk' files. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled this initial access.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell: This technique is related to maintaining access to a system, but it's not directly related to the initial access.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link: This technique is related to the delivery of a malicious payload via a link, which is similar to the '.lnk' files mentioned in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the related TTPs, the most relevant one is T1204.001-Malicious Link, which involves delivering a malicious payload via a link. The '.lnk' files mentioned in the question are a type of malicious link that can be used to deliver payloads. This technique is likely to be used for initial access.

Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing is not directly related to the delivery of malicious links.
Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading is a technique that involves disguising malicious files as legitimate ones, but it's not directly related to the delivery of malicious links.
Answer Choice C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations is a technique related to persistence and not directly related to the initial access.
Answer Choice D: T1078.001-Default Accounts is a technique related to initial access, but it's not directly related to the delivery of malicious links.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the delivery of malicious links, which is T1204.001-Malicious Link.

Final Answer: B
