To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS
   - These TTPs are related to reconnaissance, command and control, and hiding infrastructure, which are all relevant to the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is a broad technique that could be relevant, but it's not specific to DNSpionage or the use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic.
   - Answer Choice B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules is related to hiding malicious activity, but it's not directly related to DNSpionage or the use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic.
   - Answer Choice C: T1590.005-IP Addresses is a specific technique that could be related to DNSpionage, but it's not the most likely precursor to the use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic.
   - Answer Choice D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is not directly related to DNSpionage or the use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic.

However, considering the related TTPs, the most relevant one is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, which is a technique used for reconnaissance. This technique is likely to occur before the use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the precursor to DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes.
   - The related TTPs suggest that reconnaissance is a key part of the attack.
   - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a reconnaissance technique that would provide the necessary information for DNSpionage to redirect traffic.

5. Final Answer: 
   Final Answer: A
