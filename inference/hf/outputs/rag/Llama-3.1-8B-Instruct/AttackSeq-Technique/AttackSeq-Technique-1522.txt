Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker who has obfuscated their malicious code using the Dean Edwards Packer and base62 encoding for defense evasion. The attacker then appends the obfuscated code to a compromised CDN's Javascript file. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred prior to this action.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are all related to Defense Evasion, which is the tactic in question. Specifically, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is mentioned, which is the technique of making files or information difficult to detect by using various methods of obfuscation.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1659-Content Injection is not directly related to the defense evasion tactic, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.
- Answer Choice B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a tactic that involves compromising a website or application, but it doesn't directly relate to the defense evasion tactic or the specific actions described in the question.
- Answer Choice C: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain is a tactic that involves compromising the supply chain of hardware, which is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is the technique of making files or information difficult to detect by using various methods of obfuscation, which is directly related to the defense evasion tactic and the actions described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker used the Dean Edwards Packer and base62 encoding for defense evasion, which is a method of making files or information difficult to detect.
2. The attacker then appended the obfuscated code to a compromised CDN's Javascript file, which suggests that the code was already present on the compromised CDN.
3. Given that the code was already present on the compromised CDN, it's likely that the attacker compromised the CDN first, which would involve T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information as a technique to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
