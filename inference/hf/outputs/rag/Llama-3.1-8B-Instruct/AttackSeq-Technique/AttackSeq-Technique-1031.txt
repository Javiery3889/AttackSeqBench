To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack scenario where an adversary, Kingslayer, employs a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion using a stolen code signing private key. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated its deployment into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provided are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002-Code Signing
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion
   - These TTPs are related to Defense Evasion techniques, specifically code signing and time-based evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Answer Choice A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain - This choice is not directly related to software subversion or code signing.
   - Answer Choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise - This choice is related to compromising the supply chain, which could involve stealing a code signing private key and using it for software subversion.
   - Answer Choice C: T1021.005-VNC - This choice is related to remote access, not software subversion or code signing.
   - Answer Choice D: T1219-Remote Access Software - This choice is also related to remote access, not software subversion or code signing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions a stolen code signing private key, which is used for Defense Evasion (T1553.002-Code Signing).
   - The question also mentions a sophisticated software subversion, which is related to compromising the supply chain (T1195).
   - Given the context of code signing and software subversion, the most plausible answer choice is related to supply chain compromise.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer choice is B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise. This choice aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, which involves a stolen code signing private key and sophisticated software subversion.

Final Answer: B
