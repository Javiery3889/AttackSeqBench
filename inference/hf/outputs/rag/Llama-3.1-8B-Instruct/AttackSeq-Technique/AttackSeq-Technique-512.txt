To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attacker achieving persistence through the use of HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to transmit encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker used registry keys to achieve persistence, specifically through autorun system registry keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique is not relevant to transmitting data via HTTP POST requests.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application-layer protocols, such as HTTP, to communicate with the C2 infrastructure. Given that the question mentions transmitting data via HTTP POST requests, this technique seems plausible.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application-layer protocols, such as DNS or SMB, to communicate with the C2 infrastructure. This does not match the HTTP POST requests described in the question.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is related to achieving persistence, but it does not involve transmitting data via HTTP POST requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attacker achieving persistence through registry keys and then transmitting data via HTTP POST requests.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used registry keys for persistence.
   - The most plausible technique for transmitting data via HTTP POST requests is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
   - Therefore, the final answer is:
   Final Answer: B
