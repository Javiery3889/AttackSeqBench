To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the Question**
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker, Machete, which includes:
1. Establishing command and control using FTP and HTTP.
2. Encrypting data with AES for transmission.
3. Exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file is present.

**Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs**
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB

These TTPs are all related to exfiltration techniques, which is the tactic in question. However, they don't directly relate to the specific actions described in the question.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the given sequence of actions:
A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel using asymmetric encryption. However, the question mentions that data is encrypted with AES for transmission, which is symmetric encryption, not asymmetric. This makes this option less likely.
B: T1113-Screen Capture - This technique involves capturing the screen of a user, which is not related to the actions described in the question.
C: T1056.001-Keylogging - This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is not related to the actions described in the question.
D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, such as a USB drive. This option aligns with the action of Machete copying data to removable drives.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Machete exfiltrated data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file was present, which aligns with the technique of exfiltrating data over a physical medium.

Final Answer: D
