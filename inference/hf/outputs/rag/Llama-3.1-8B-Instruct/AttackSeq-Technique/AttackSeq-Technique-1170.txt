To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the ATT&CK technique that Longhorn used to maintain operational security and avoid detection during its external communication process with C&C servers. The key phrase here is "maintain operational security and avoid detection," which suggests that the technique is related to concealing or encrypting communication.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1572-Protocol Tunneling
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS

   These TTPs are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, which involve establishing and maintaining communication between an attacker and their C2 servers. However, the question is specifically asking about maintaining operational security and avoiding detection, which is more closely related to techniques that involve encryption or concealment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing malware in memory rather than on disk, which is not directly related to maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during communication.
   - **B and C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data at a scheduled time, which is not directly related to maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which is directly related to maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is the one that involves encryption, which is the best way to maintain operational security and avoid detection during communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
