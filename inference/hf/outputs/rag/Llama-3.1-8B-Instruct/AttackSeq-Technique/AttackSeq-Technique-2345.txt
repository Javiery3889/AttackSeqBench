To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attacker group, BRONZE PRESIDENT, developing its own remote access tools and utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure. It then uses tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they employed these tools.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool
     - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At
   - These TTPs indicate that the attackers are involved in developing their own tools (Resource Development) and using them for execution (Execution).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique is related to social engineering and doesn't directly relate to the development of tools or their execution.
   - **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique is related to web-based attacks and doesn't fit the context of developing and executing tools.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising software supply chains, which could be a way to obtain tools, but it's not directly related to developing tools.
   - **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining capabilities, which could be tools, and is closely related to the development of tools (T1588.002-Tool) mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions BRONZE PRESIDENT developing its own remote access tools, which aligns with the Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool.
   - The question then mentions utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure and using tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution, which aligns with the Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At.
   - The most plausible sequence of events is that BRONZE PRESIDENT first obtained capabilities (tools) and then used them for execution.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that BRONZE PRESIDENT first obtained capabilities (tools) and then used them for execution. Therefore, the correct answer is:
   Final Answer: D
