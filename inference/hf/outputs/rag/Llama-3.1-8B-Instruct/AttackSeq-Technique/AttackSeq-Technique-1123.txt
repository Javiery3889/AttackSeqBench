To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an APT group establishing a simple remote command shell connecting to its C2 server after deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL. This indicates a multi-stage attack where the attackers first load a malicious DLL to gain a foothold, and then establish a command shell for further control.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. We have three TTPs related to the question:
- T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique is related to the command and control tactic, which involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system.
- T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading: This technique is related to the defense evasion tactic, which involves loading a malicious DLL to bypass security controls.
- T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is also related to the privilege escalation tactic, which involves loading a malicious DLL to gain elevated privileges.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:
A: T1218.008-Odbcconf - This technique is not directly related to the deployment of a malicious DLL or establishing a command shell.
B: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS - This technique is related to the command and control tactic, but it's not directly related to the deployment of a malicious DLL.
C: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is related to the command and control tactic, but it's not directly related to the deployment of a malicious DLL.
D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow - This technique is not directly related to the deployment of a malicious DLL or establishing a command shell.

However, T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is directly related to the deployment of a malicious DLL. Given that the question mentions deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL, this technique is the most likely to occur before establishing a command shell.

However, the question asks for the technique that occurred after deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load the malicious DLL. Therefore, we need to find a technique that is related to the command and control tactic, which is likely to occur after the malicious DLL is loaded.

Based on the related TTPs, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is the most likely technique to occur after the malicious DLL is loaded, as it is related to establishing a command and control channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The attackers deploy a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading).
2. The malicious DLL is loaded, and the attackers establish a command and control channel (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels).

**Final Answer: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
