To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker connecting to a C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and executing additional payloads through reflection methods to establish backdoor access. This implies that the attacker has already gained initial access to the system and is now escalating their privileges and establishing a persistent backdoor.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server, which could be used for reflection methods.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to the compromised system, which could be related to the CARBANAK RAT.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native API calls to interact with the operating system. While it could be used for process injection, it's not directly related to the C2 server connection or reflection methods.

B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI: This technique involves accessing a network device using a command-line interface. It's not directly related to the C2 server connection or reflection methods.

C: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports to communicate with the C2 server. This could be related to the reflection methods used to establish backdoor access.

D: T1080-Taint Shared Content: This technique involves injecting malicious code into shared content, such as documents or scripts. While it's a defense evasion technique, it's not directly related to the C2 server connection or reflection methods.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. The attacker used process injection (T1055) to evade detection and gain initial access to the system.
2. The attacker used multi-stage channels (T1104) to communicate with the C2 server, which could involve reflection methods.
3. The attacker transferred the CARBANAK RAT to the compromised system (T1105) to establish backdoor access.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
