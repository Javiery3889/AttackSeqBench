To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where Gamaredon uses a backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves discovering files and directories on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A: T1596.002-WHOIS: This technique is related to gathering information about the target's domain name and IP address, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
   - Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls: This technique involves subverting trust controls, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
   - Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection: This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which aligns with the use of a backdoor to automatically list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase.
   - Answer Choice D: T1213.001-Confluence: This technique is related to gathering information from collaboration platforms, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.

Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to automated collection of data from the local system and network shares.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The question describes an attack scenario where Gamaredon uses a backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase.
- The goal is to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is collecting data from the local system and network shares.
- The most plausible technique that aligns with this scenario is T1119-Automated Collection, as it involves using automated tools to collect data.

**Final Answer: C**
