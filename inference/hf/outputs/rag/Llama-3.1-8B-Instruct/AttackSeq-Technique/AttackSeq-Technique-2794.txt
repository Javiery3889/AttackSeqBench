Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where an XAgent app collects information from an iOS device and then uploads files to a C2 (Command and Control) server via FTP. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates this action.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration (exfiltration of data without user interaction)
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltration of data through a C2 channel)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols (use of file transfer protocols for C2 communication)

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques related to exfiltration and C2 communication are relevant to the question. The question specifically mentions uploading files via FTP to a C2 server, which aligns with the Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols.

Answer Choice Analysis:
- A: T1204-User Execution is not directly related to file transfer or C2 communication.
- B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS is related to domain name system (DNS) tunneling, which is not directly related to file transfer.
- C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is related to privilege escalation, which is not directly related to file transfer.
- D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is related to the transfer of tools or malware into a network, but it does not specifically mention file transfer via FTP.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is the one that directly relates to file transfer protocols for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
