To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spearphishing email with an Excel attachment that led to malware being executed, and the malware deleted the original file to evade defense mechanisms.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are related to Initial Access, specifically T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This indicates that the attack started with a spearphishing email attachment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves an attacker convincing a user to execute a malicious file. However, the question states that the malware deleted the original file, which doesn't necessarily imply user execution.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves an attacker collecting data from the local system. While this could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly relate to the initial action of deleting the original file.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves an attacker using native API calls to interact with the system. While this could be a possible step, it's not directly related to the deletion of the original file.
   - **D: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves an attacker modifying the registry to execute a malicious file at startup. However, the question doesn't mention any registry modifications.

However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of events is that the spearphishing email attachment was executed, and the malware deleted the original file to evade detection. This implies that the malware was executed, which is the primary action of T1204-User Execution.

However, the deletion of the original file to evade defense mechanisms is more closely related to T1569-System Service Discovery, but since that is not an option, the closest related technique is T1204-User Execution, which is the initial action that led to the malware being executed.

**Final Answer: A**
