To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where SideCopy used njRAT malware with specific victim IDs and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this action.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
2. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB

These TTPs are related to exfiltration techniques, which involve the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception - This technique is related to social engineering and credential access, which doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data.

B: T1659-Content Injection - This technique involves injecting malicious content into a document or file, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

C: T1056-Input Capture - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a system or network, which aligns with the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, which is a type of data exfiltration.
2. The related TTPs (T1041 and T1052.001) are also related to exfiltration techniques.
3. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique that aligns with the exfiltration of data from a system or network.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: D
