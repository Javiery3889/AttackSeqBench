To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and then deleted itself to evade detection. We need to find the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this sequence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities
   - These TTPs are related to evading detection by deleting files and renaming system utilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - Answer Choice B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - Answer Choice C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications - This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique is related to evading detection by hiding or deleting artifacts. Given the context of the question, this is the most plausible answer. The obfuscated VBS script deleting itself post-execution is a form of hiding artifacts, which aligns with the T1564-Hide Artifacts technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and then deleted itself to evade detection.
   - The related TTPs are related to evading detection by deleting files and renaming system utilities.
   - Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts is the most plausible answer as it directly relates to hiding or deleting artifacts, which aligns with the described sequence of events.

Final Answer: D
