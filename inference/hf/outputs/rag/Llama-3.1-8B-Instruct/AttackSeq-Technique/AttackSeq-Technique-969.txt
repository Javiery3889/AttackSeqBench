Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker using the Aria-body backdoor. The backdoor first collects system information such as hostname, username, and system architecture. Then, it proceeds to collect file metadata and take screenshots. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial system information collection but before the collection of file metadata and screenshots.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the initial action of collecting system information.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1113-Screen Capture: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is the final action described in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the sequence of actions, we need to find a technique that fits between the initial system information collection (T1082) and the final screenshot collection (T1113). 

- A: T1614-System Location Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system's location, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- B: T1087-Account Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about user accounts, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- C: T1205.001-Port Knocking: This technique involves using a port knocking technique to gain access to a system, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- D: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves establishing an encrypted communication channel, which could be a plausible step after collecting system information to ensure secure communication for the next steps, such as collecting file metadata and taking screenshots.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial action is collecting system information (T1082).
2. The next step should be a technique that prepares for the collection of file metadata and screenshots.
3. Establishing an encrypted channel (T1573) would be a logical step to ensure secure communication for the next actions.

Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
