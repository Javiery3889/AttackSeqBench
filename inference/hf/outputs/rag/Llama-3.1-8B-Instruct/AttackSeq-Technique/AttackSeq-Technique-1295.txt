To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attacker establishing persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain a Poison Ivy server process. This indicates the attacker is using a custom malware (Poison Ivy) to maintain a connection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
   - These TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, which involve the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system. T1571 and T1095 both involve non-standard communication protocols, which could be used to secure communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique is not directly related to securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: While a proxy can be used to secure communication, the question specifically mentions a custom network protocol over TCP, which is not directly related to proxying.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique is related to executing code based on system events, which is not directly related to securing communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves securing communication using an encrypted channel, which aligns with the idea of using a custom network protocol over TCP to secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attacker using a custom malware (Poison Ivy) to maintain a connection and secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
   - The related TTPs (T1571 and T1095) are related to non-standard communication protocols, which could be used to secure communication.
   - Based on this information, the most plausible answer is D: T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it involves securing communication using an encrypted channel, which aligns with the idea of using a custom network protocol over TCP.

Final Answer: D
