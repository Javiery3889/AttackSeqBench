To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where PROMETHIUM used a document search module to locate and parse files in preparation for exfiltration to a C2 server. This indicates that the attacker is in the process of collecting data from the compromised system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

These TTPs are related to the exfiltration of data from the compromised system to a C2 server. T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools to exfiltrate data, while T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise - This technique is related to compromising a software update or patch to gain access to a system, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

B: T1119-Automated Collection - This technique is related to the use of automated tools to collect data, which aligns with the use of a document search module to locate and parse files.

C: T1569-System Services - This technique is related to the exploitation of system services to gain access to a system, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

D: T1560-Archive Collected Data - This technique is related to archiving collected data, which is a step that occurs after the data has been exfiltrated.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. The attacker used a document search module to locate and parse files (T1119-Automated Collection).
2. The collected data is then exfiltrated to the C2 server using automated tools (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).
3. The exfiltrated data is then transmitted over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

**Final Answer: B: T1119-Automated Collection**
