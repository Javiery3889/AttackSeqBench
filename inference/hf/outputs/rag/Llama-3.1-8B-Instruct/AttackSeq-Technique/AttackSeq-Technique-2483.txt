To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses during the attack. Reflective code loading is a technique used to load malicious code into a process without writing it to disk, making it difficult to detect.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1620-Reflective Code Loading
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal

These TTPs are related to evasion techniques, which suggests that the adversaries are trying to avoid detection.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels - This technique is related to command and control (C2) channels, which is not directly related to evasion techniques.

B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation - This technique is related to domain name system (DNS) calculation, which is not directly related to evasion techniques.

C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies - This technique is related to conditional access policies, which is not directly related to evasion techniques.

D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique is related to exploiting public-facing applications, which is not directly related to evasion techniques.

However, none of these options directly follow reflective code loading. But, considering the context of evasion techniques, we can infer that the next step would be to remove indicators of the attack to avoid detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The adversaries used reflective code loading (T1620) to evade defenses.
2. To maintain the evasion, the next step would be to remove indicators of the attack (T1070) to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: T1070-Indicator Removal**
