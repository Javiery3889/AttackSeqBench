Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker, CosmicDuke, uses Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on the network and hard drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

These TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery techniques to gather information about the environment. T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery involves identifying and gathering information about peripheral devices connected to the network, while T1083-File and Directory Discovery involves identifying and gathering information about files and directories on the system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the most relevant TTP is T1083-File and Directory Discovery, as it involves gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with the description of identifying targeted files on network and hard drives.

Considering the answer choices, D: T1025-Data from Removable Media is the most plausible sequence of TTPs. This technique involves gathering data from removable media, which aligns with the description of gathering information from removable drives.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes an attacker using Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on the network and hard drives.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using Discovery techniques to gather information about the environment.
3. The most relevant TTP is T1083-File and Directory Discovery, which involves gathering information about files and directories.
4. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when gathering information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.
5. Based on the context, T1025-Data from Removable Media is the most plausible sequence of TTPs, as it involves gathering data from removable media.

Final Answer: D
