To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Tropic Trooper, a malware, after it has decrypted its configuration file and connected using the SSL protocol. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before they leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

   These TTPs are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics, which involve the communication between the malware and the C2 server. T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1571-Non-Standard Port are related to the communication protocols used, while T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation is related to the impersonation of legitimate services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique is not directly related to the communication protocols used by the malware.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encryption to protect the communication channel, which aligns with the use of custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data, which is not related to the communication protocols used by the malware.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is related to the deployment of malware, not the communication protocols used.

Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware used an encrypted channel (T1573-Encrypted Channel) to connect to the C&C server before leveraging custom SSL libraries.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The malware connected using the SSL protocol, indicating that encryption is already being used.
- To securely connect to the C&C server, the malware would likely use an encrypted channel to protect the communication.
- The use of custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server suggests that the malware is using an encrypted channel to communicate.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
