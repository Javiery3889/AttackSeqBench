To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where the Pierogi backdoor is executed by downloading and running it via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to ensure the backdoor would run upon user login.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File - This TTP is related to the initial execution of the Pierogi backdoor via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents.
2. Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This TTP is related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial execution of the Pierogi backdoor is related to T1204.002-Malicious File, and the persistence mechanism to ensure it runs upon user login is related to T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Considering the question asks which technique most likely occurred to ensure the backdoor would run upon user login, the answer should be related to persistence. Among the answer choices, only B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution aligns with the persistence mechanism.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The Pierogi backdoor was executed via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents, which is related to T1204.002-Malicious File.
2. To ensure the backdoor runs upon user login, a persistence mechanism is required.
3. The related TTP for persistence is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
