Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access was gained via exploitation of Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) using Tropic Trooper. The next step involves the execution of a backdoor's installer, which is triggered by users' action or interaction.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side applications to execute malicious code.
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves delivering a malicious file to a victim's system, which can be executed by the user.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A (T1573-Encrypted Channel) is not relevant to the scenario as it involves encrypting communication between the attacker and the victim, which is not mentioned in the question.
- Answer Choice B (T1564.009-Resource Forking) is not relevant as it involves creating multiple copies of a process to evade detection, which is not described in the question.
- Answer Choice C (T1648-Serverless Execution) is not relevant as it involves executing code without a server, which is not mentioned in the question.
- Answer Choice D (T1204-User Execution) is the most plausible as it involves the execution of a malicious file by a user, which aligns with the scenario described in the question. The execution of the backdoor's installer is triggered by users' action or interaction, indicating that the malicious file is executed by the user.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access was gained via exploitation of Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) using Tropic Trooper.
2. The next step involves the execution of a backdoor's installer.
3. The execution of the backdoor's installer is triggered by users' action or interaction, indicating that the malicious file is executed by the user.
4. Based on the related TTPs, T1204.002-Malicious File involves delivering a malicious file to a victim's system, which can be executed by the user.
5. Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment is T1204-User Execution.

Final Answer: D
