To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where an Explosive Trojan is used to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this sequence.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media
2. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media

These TTPs are related to the use of removable media (e.g., USB drives) for initial access and lateral movement.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attack sequence involves the use of removable media for initial access and lateral movement. The question mentions the use of manual methods and USB infection, which aligns with the T1091-Replication Through Removable Media technique.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application-layer protocols for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. It's not directly related to the use of removable media.

B: T1056-Input Capture: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse clicks. It's not directly related to the use of removable media.

C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket: This technique involves using a compromised domain controller to obtain Kerberos tickets for lateral movement. While it's a lateral movement technique, it's not directly related to the use of removable media.

D: T1552.008-Chat Messages: This technique involves using chat messages for C2 or data exfiltration. It's not directly related to the use of removable media.

Considering the related TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the use of removable media for lateral movement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
