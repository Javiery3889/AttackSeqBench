To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred before initial access to target systems was achieved via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros. This implies that the question is looking for a technique that happened before the actual phishing attack.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment
   These TTPs are related to spearphishing, which is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or groups. The fact that these TTPs are related to initial access suggests that they are part of the initial phase of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**: This technique is not directly related to gathering information about potential victims. It's more about manipulating data, which is a later stage in the attack.
   - **B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique is related to obtaining or using digital certificates, which is not directly related to gathering information about potential victims.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves gathering information about potential victims through phishing, which is a plausible precursor to the spearphishing attack described in the question.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: This technique is about searching open technical databases, which is not directly related to gathering information about potential victims.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker gathered information about potential victims before sending them spearphishing emails.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The question asks about the technique that occurred before initial access to target systems was achieved via phishing emails.
- The related TTPs are related to spearphishing, which is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or groups.
- The technique that fits best with gathering information about potential victims before the attack is T1598-Phishing for Information.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
