Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script is executed in memory and then uses WScript Shell to create auxiliary files for payload execution. This indicates that the PowerShell script is being used to execute a command or script, which is a key aspect of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell: This technique involves using a Windows Command Shell to execute a command or script.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute a command or script.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that both T1059.003 and T1059.001 involve executing a command or script using a shell or PowerShell. However, the question specifically mentions the use of PowerShell, which aligns with T1059.001. 

The other options do not directly relate to the execution of a command or script using PowerShell. T1553-Subvert Trust Controls involves manipulating trust controls to gain unauthorized access, T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation involves impersonating a protocol or service, and T1610-Deploy Container involves deploying a container, none of which are directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a PowerShell script being executed in memory and running a WScript Shell to create auxiliary files for payload execution.
2. This indicates that the PowerShell script is being used to execute a command or script.
3. The related TTPs show that T1059.001-PowerShell involves using PowerShell to execute a command or script.
4. The other options do not directly relate to the execution of a PowerShell script.

Final Answer: B
