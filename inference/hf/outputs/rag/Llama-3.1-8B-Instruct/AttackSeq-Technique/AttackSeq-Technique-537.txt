To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious .lnk (shortcut) is installed in the Windows Startup folder to establish persistence. Then, a variant of PIVY executes a copied version of rundll32.exe with a path to a malicious DLL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification: This TTP is related to the initial action of installing a malicious .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: This TTP is related to the persistence mechanism, but it's more focused on the registry run keys rather than the shortcut modification.
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: This TTP is similar to the previous one but is more focused on the registry run keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the PIVY variant executed a copied version of rundll32.exe with the path to the malicious DLL. This action involves executing a command or script, which is a key characteristic of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.
   - The rundll32.exe is a command-line utility that executes in-process dynamic-link library (DLL) modules. Executing a DLL through rundll32.exe is a form of command execution, which aligns with the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the action of executing a copied version of rundll32.exe with a path to a malicious DLL is most likely related to the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the execution of a command or script. T1609-Container Administration Command is related to container administration, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is related to network communication, and T1542.005-TFTP Boot is related to booting a system via TFTP.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
