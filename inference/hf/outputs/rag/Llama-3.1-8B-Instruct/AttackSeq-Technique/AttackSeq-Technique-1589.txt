Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has performed DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe and initiated further execution of its payload. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely ensured T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process at system startup, typically through the AppInit_DLLs registry key. This allows the DLL to run with every user mode process spawned.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process without using the Windows loader, often through DLL sideloading.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the provided TTPs, the goal is to find a technique that ensures T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot. 

- Option A, T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, is not relevant to the scenario as it deals with evading detection in virtualized or sandboxed environments.
- Option B, T1036.003-Rename System Utilities, is not relevant as it involves renaming system utilities, which is not related to the persistence of T9000's components.
- Option D, T1543-Create or Modify System Process, is not directly related to ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned.
- Option C, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, is the most plausible answer. This technique involves ensuring that an application or process runs at boot or logon, which aligns with the goal of ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe and further execution of its payload.
2. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique ensures T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.
3. The related TTPs provide insight into techniques related to persistence and DLL loading.
4. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique as it ensures an application or process runs at boot or logon, aligning with the goal of persistence.

Final Answer: C
