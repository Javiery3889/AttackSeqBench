To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes APT-TOCS conducting lateral movement within the internal network and then communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs. This indicates a transition from lateral movement to command and control (C2) activities.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They include:

- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (indicating the initial lateral movement)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (indicating C2 activities using web protocols)
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer (indicating the transfer of tools for lateral movement)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall - This technique is not directly related to the transition from lateral movement to C2 activities.
B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique is not directly related to the transition from lateral movement to C2 activities.
C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique is a parent technique that includes T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is directly related to the C2 activities described in the question. This makes it a plausible choice.
D: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is related to C2 activities but does not directly indicate the transition from lateral movement to C2 activities.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. APT-TOCS conducted lateral movement within the internal network (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services).
2. To establish C2, APT-TOCS would need to use a protocol to communicate with compromised systems.
3. The most likely protocol used for C2 in this scenario is a web protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is lateral movement (T1210) followed by C2 using web protocols (T1071.001).

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
