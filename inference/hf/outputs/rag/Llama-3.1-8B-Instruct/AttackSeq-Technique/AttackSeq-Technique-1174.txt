To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving public exploits (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) and APT29 maintaining persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (deploying public exploits)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts (obtaining legitimate credentials)
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts (maintaining persistent access using legitimate credentials)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions deploying public exploits (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) to gain initial access, which aligns with T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is obtaining legitimate credentials, which is described in the related TTPs as T1078-Valid Accounts (Defense Evasion and Persistence).
   - The question also mentions using anonymizing services, which is not directly related to the provided TTPs but is a common technique used for Defense Evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step is deploying public exploits (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix), which is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.
   - The next step is obtaining legitimate credentials, which is T1078-Valid Accounts.
   - Since the question asks for the technique that occurred before APT29 maintained persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials, we can conclude that the correct answer is the technique that directly precedes obtaining legitimate credentials.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the technique that directly precedes obtaining legitimate credentials, which is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

Final Answer: A
