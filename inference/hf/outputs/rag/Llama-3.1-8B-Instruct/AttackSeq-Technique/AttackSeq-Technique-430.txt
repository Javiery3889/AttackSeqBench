To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes the Sednit group's malware using AutoIt downloader to gather system information, which was deemed interesting by the server. This implies that the malware has successfully gathered some valuable information about the system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
2. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1592.002-Software
3. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595-Active Scanning

These TTPs are all related to reconnaissance and discovery, which aligns with the initial steps of the attack. The question mentions that the malware gathered system information, which is consistent with T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we need to find a technique that is likely to occur after the malware has gathered system information and deemed the server as an interesting target.

- A: T1600-Weaken Encryption is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that involves manipulating application-layer protocols, which is not directly related to the scenario.
- C: T1558.002-Silver Ticket is a technique that involves exploiting Kerberos, which is not directly related to the scenario.
- D: T1219-Remote Access Software is a technique that involves using remote access tools, which is a plausible next step after gathering system information and deeming the server as an interesting target.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malware used AutoIt downloader to gather system information (T1082-System Information Discovery).
2. The server deemed the system as an interesting target.
3. The next logical step would be to establish a remote access to the system to further exploit it.

**Final Answer: D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
