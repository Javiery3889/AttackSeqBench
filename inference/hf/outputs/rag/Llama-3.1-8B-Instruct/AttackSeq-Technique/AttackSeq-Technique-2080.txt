To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has already gained Initial Access through Drive-by Compromise via malvertising or compromised websites. The next step in the attack sequence involves executing an obfuscated PowerShell script for fetching malware.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This TTP indicates the use of PowerShell as a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This TTP confirms the initial access gained through malvertising or compromised websites.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile: This TTP involves modifying the PowerShell profile, which is not directly related to executing an obfuscated PowerShell script.

B: T1053.003-Cron: This TTP involves using a scheduled task (Cron) to execute a command, which is not directly related to PowerShell or the given context.

C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities: This TTP involves obtaining capabilities, which is a broad term and not specific to the execution of a PowerShell script.

D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This TTP involves using a command or scripting interpreter, which is a broad category that includes PowerShell. Given the context of the question, this is the most likely technique to execute an obfuscated PowerShell script.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker has gained Initial Access through Drive-by Compromise (T1189).
2. The next step involves executing an obfuscated PowerShell script, which suggests the use of PowerShell as a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
3. Based on the related TTPs, T1059.001-PowerShell is a specific instance of T1059, which involves using PowerShell as a Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
