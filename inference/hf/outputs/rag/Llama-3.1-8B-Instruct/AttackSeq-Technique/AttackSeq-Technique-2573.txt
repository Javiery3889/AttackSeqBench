Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker using an Emissary Trojan to maintain persistence on a targeted system. The Emissary Trojan is utilizing methods such as hijacking legitimate services or adding startup code to maintain persistence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service: This technique involves creating a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking: This technique involves modifying the system's DLL search order to load a malicious DLL.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attacker is using techniques related to persistence. The question mentions the Emissary Trojan maintaining persistence on the targeted system. 

- Option A (T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures) is related to database exploitation and does not directly relate to maintaining persistence on a system.
- Option B (T1543.002-Systemd Service) is related to Linux systems and does not match the context of the question, which mentions Windows services.
- Option C (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is a technique that involves adding code to the boot or logon process to maintain persistence, which aligns with the methods used by the Emissary Trojan.
- Option D (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) is a technique related to web-based attacks and does not match the context of the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to adding code to the boot or logon process to maintain persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes an Emissary Trojan maintaining persistence on a targeted system.
2. The related TTPs provide context about techniques related to persistence.
3. Option C (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is the only option that directly relates to adding code to the boot or logon process to maintain persistence.

Final Answer: C
