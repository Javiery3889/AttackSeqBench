To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred in this scenario.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing (not directly relevant to the question)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (not directly relevant to the question)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (relevant to the question, as it involves spearphishing with attachments)
   - The question mentions spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros, which is a type of attachment-based spearphishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token (not directly related to the scenario, as it involves stealing access tokens, not capturing credentials)
   - Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture (relevant to the question, as it involves capturing user input, such as credentials, through a spearphishing email with a macro)
   - Answer Choice C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule (not directly related to the scenario, as it involves email forwarding rules, not capturing credentials)
   - Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal (not directly related to the scenario, as it involves removing indicators, not capturing credentials)

Based on the related TTPs and the scenario described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to capturing user credentials through a spearphishing email with a macro.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The question describes a scenario where FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.
- The related TTPs include T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which involves spearphishing with attachments.
- T1056-Input Capture is the most relevant technique, as it involves capturing user input, such as credentials, through a spearphishing email with a macro.

**Final Answer: B**
