Analysis of the Question:
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor. This implies that the technique must be related to initial access or establishing a foothold on the network.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) and specifically mention T1071.004-DNS, which is a technique for using DNS for C2. This suggests that the initial access was likely facilitated through DNS.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1078.003-Local Accounts: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a network, which is not directly related to DNS.
- B: T1133-External Remote Services: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network, which could be related to DNS but is not as specific as the related TTP.
- C: T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a network, which is not directly related to DNS.
- D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts: This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a network, which is not directly related to DNS.

Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to using DNS for C2, which suggests that the initial access was facilitated through DNS. However, the question asks for the technique that facilitated remote access before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor. Given the options, the closest related technique is T1133-External Remote Services, as it involves using external services, which could include DNS, to gain remote access to a network.

Final Answer: B
