To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes ProjectM targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites. We need to determine how ProjectM most likely developed its capabilities after this initial step.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear-phishing emails)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise (watering hole sites)
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link (spear-phishing links)
   - These TTPs indicate that ProjectM used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to gain initial access to the targeted systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1543.005-Container Service**: This technique is related to container service exploitation, which is not directly related to the initial access methods described in the question.
   - **B: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This technique is related to network device exploitation, which is also not directly related to the initial access methods described in the question.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique is related to developing capabilities, which is a plausible next step after gaining initial access to the targeted systems.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique is related to gathering victim identity information, which is a step that might occur before developing capabilities, but it's not the most direct next step after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Based on the related TTPs, ProjectM used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to gain initial access to the targeted systems.
   - The next logical step would be for ProjectM to develop its capabilities, such as establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, and moving laterally within the network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that ProjectM developed its capabilities after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: C
