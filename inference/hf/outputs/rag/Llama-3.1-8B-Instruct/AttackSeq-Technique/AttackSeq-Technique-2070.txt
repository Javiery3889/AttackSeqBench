To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access was gained via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper. The loader Trojan.Vcrodat then executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the initial access.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File: This TTP is related to the execution of malicious files, which is relevant to the execution of malicious DLLs by the loader Trojan.Vcrodat.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This TTP is related to the initial access gained via spear-phishing emails.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP is related to the spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access was gained via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). The loader Trojan.Vcrodat then executed malicious DLLs (T1204.002-Malicious File) to gain elevated privileges.

Considering the answer choices:

A: T1608.004-Drive-by Target: This technique is related to drive-by downloads, which is not relevant to the given scenario.

B: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique is related to remote system discovery, which is not relevant to the given scenario.

C: T1129-Shared Modules: This technique is related to shared modules, which is not directly related to the execution of malicious DLLs.

D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools: This technique is related to the execution of software deployment tools, which aligns with the execution of malicious DLLs by the loader Trojan.Vcrodat.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Initial access was gained via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. The loader Trojan.Vcrodat executed malicious DLLs (T1204.002-Malicious File) to gain elevated privileges.
3. The execution of malicious DLLs is related to the execution of software deployment tools.

**Final Answer: D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
