To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used by the attackers during Operation NightScout, specifically before extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system.
   - The question is focused on the technique used to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs provide context about the attack sequence. 
   - T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain is the initial access technique used in the supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism.
   - T1070.006-Timestomp is a defense evasion technique, but it's not directly related to the question.
   - T1036-Masquerading is another defense evasion technique, which involves making malware appear as legitimate software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Answer choice C, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, is the initial access technique used in the supply chain attack, but it's not the technique used to evade detection.
   - Answer choice A, T1497.001-System Checks, is not directly related to the question.
   - Answer choice D, T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice, is not relevant to the context of the question.
   - Answer choice B, T1564-Hide Artifacts, is a defense evasion technique that involves concealing malicious files or data from detection. This is the most plausible technique used to evade detection before extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about the technique used to evade detection before extracting C&C information.
   - The related TTPs provide context about the attack sequence, including the initial access technique (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain) and defense evasion techniques (T1036-Masquerading and T1070.006-Timestomp).
   - Based on the context, the most plausible technique used to evade detection is T1564-Hide Artifacts, which involves concealing malicious files or data from detection.

Final Answer: B
