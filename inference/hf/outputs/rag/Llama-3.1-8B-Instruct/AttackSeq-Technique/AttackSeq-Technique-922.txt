To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Volatile Cedar, including:
1. Conducting vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
2. Using an Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:
1. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
2. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access technique is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access to the network. The reconnaissance technique is T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning, which involves scanning the network to identify vulnerabilities.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve identifying vulnerabilities through scanning (T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning) and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access to the network (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application). However, the question asks for the technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after conducting vulnerability scans.

Considering the options provided, T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the most likely technique that would allow Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after identifying vulnerabilities through scanning. This is because exploiting a public-facing application would provide a means for Volatile Cedar to gain access to the network and potentially spread further.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Volatile Cedar conducts vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers (T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning).
2. Volatile Cedar exploits the identified vulnerabilities through a public-facing application (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
3. The exploitation of the public-facing application allows Volatile Cedar to gain access to the network and potentially spread further.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
