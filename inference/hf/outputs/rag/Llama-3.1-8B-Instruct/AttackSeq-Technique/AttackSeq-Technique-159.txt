To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after account discovery to enable lateral movement within the network. This implies that the attackers have already identified local accounts on compromised systems and are now attempting to move laterally.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account (account discovery)
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts (initial access using local accounts)
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts (persistence using domain accounts)

   These TTPs indicate that the attackers have already identified local accounts and are now attempting to use them for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1021.005-VNC**: This technique is related to remote services, which is not directly related to lateral movement using local accounts.
   - **B: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique is used for initial access, not for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which could be a plausible next step after account discovery to move laterally within the network.
   - **D: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique is related to defense evasion, which is not directly related to lateral movement.

Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible next step after account discovery would be to use the identified local accounts for lateral movement, which involves using alternative authentication methods.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The attackers have identified local accounts on compromised systems (T1087.001-Local Account).
- The next logical step would be to use these local accounts for further actions, which involves using alternative authentication methods (T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material).
- This would enable the attackers to move laterally within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
