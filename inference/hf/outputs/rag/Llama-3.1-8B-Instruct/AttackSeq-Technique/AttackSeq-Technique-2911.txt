To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes APT15 evading policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe to disable the command prompt. This action is likely done to facilitate the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this action.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.002-Disable Windows Event Logging
2. Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell
3. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry

These TTPs are all related to evasion and execution techniques, which are relevant to the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable - This technique is related to kernel-mode API hooking, which is not directly related to the described action of disabling the command prompt.

B: T1562-Impair Defenses - This technique is a broader category that includes disabling Windows Event Logging (T1562.002), which is one of the related TTPs. Disabling event logging would make it harder to detect the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption - This technique is related to encrypting data, which is not directly related to the described action of disabling the command prompt.

D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates - This technique is related to certificate manipulation, which is not directly related to the described action of disabling the command prompt.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is disabling Windows Event Logging (T1562.002) to impair defenses, making it harder to detect the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe to disable the command prompt.
2. To make the backdoor installation less detectable, APT15 likely disabled Windows Event Logging (T1562.002) to impair defenses.
3. This would make it harder to detect the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

**Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
