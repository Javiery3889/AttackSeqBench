To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack where an attacker modified a Javascript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to load additional malicious code. The attacker then evaded detection using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
   - These TTPs are related to evading detection by making files or software difficult to analyze or detect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection. This is a form of software packing, which is described in T1027.002-Software Packing.
   - However, the question also mentions the initial modification of a Javascript file to load additional malicious code, which is not directly related to the provided TTPs.
   - Looking at the answer choices, we can see that T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is a broader category that includes software packing, which is a more specific technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial modification of the Javascript file to load additional malicious code is not directly related to the provided TTPs.
   - However, the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection is related to T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
   - This technique is a broader category that includes software packing, which is the more specific technique used in this case.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker modified the Javascript file to gain initial access, and then used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection, which falls under T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

Final Answer: D
