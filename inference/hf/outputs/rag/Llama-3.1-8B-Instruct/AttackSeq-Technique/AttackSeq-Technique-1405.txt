To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where TidePool, likely a threat actor, has modified registry settings to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security for defense evasion. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique enabled TidePool to communicate and execute commands from its C2 server.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry (modifying registry settings)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools (disabling or modifying tools)
   - These TTPs indicate that the threat actor is attempting to evade detection by modifying system settings and tools.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1001.002-Steganography is not relevant to the scenario as it involves hiding data within a file or communication, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - Answer Choice B: T1601-Modify System Image is not relevant as it involves modifying the system image, which is not related to the registry settings modification.
   - Answer Choice C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is not relevant as it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - Answer Choice D: T1219-Remote Access Software is the most plausible choice as it involves enabling remote access to the system, which would allow TidePool to communicate and execute commands from its C2 server.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The threat actor modified registry settings to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security, which is a defense evasion technique (T1112-Modify Registry).
   - This modification likely allowed the threat actor to execute commands or communicate with its C2 server, which would require remote access to the system.
   - The most plausible technique that enabled this remote access is T1219-Remote Access Software.

5. Final Answer: 
   Final Answer: D
