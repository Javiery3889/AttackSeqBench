To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where a malware is executed as ActiveFlash.exe using rundll32.exe. The goal is to ensure the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. We have three TTPs related to the question:
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique is related to persistence, where an attacker attempts to ensure the malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon.
- T1218.011-Rundll32: This technique is related to defense evasion, where an attacker uses rundll32.exe to execute a malicious DLL.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique is also related to persistence, similar to the first one.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the question is related to persistence, specifically ensuring the malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon. The use of rundll32.exe to execute the malware is a defense evasion technique.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:
A and C are the same, which is a mistake in the question. We can ignore this option.
B: T1546.002-Screensaver is not related to the scenario described in the question.
D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most plausible answer, as it directly relates to the persistence technique described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The malware is executed as ActiveFlash.exe using rundll32.exe, which is a defense evasion technique (T1218.011-Rundll32).
2. The goal is to ensure the malware starts automatically during system boot or user logon, which is a persistence technique (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
