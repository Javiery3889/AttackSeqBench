To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of techniques used by Hidden Cobra before executing their Bankshot implant via a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878. This implies that the question is asking about the initial steps taken by the attackers to set up the exploitation.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability on a client-side system to execute arbitrary code.
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves delivering a malicious file to a victim's system.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a technique that likely occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878, which is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The exploitation of this vulnerability would involve delivering a malicious file to the victim's system, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.

However, the question specifically asks about the technique that occurred before the exploitation. Considering the related TTPs, T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution is the most likely candidate because it involves exploiting a vulnerability on a client-side system, which is a prerequisite for delivering a malicious file (T1204.002-Malicious File) that exploits CVE-2018-4878.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers need to exploit a vulnerability on the client-side system to execute arbitrary code.
2. The exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 is a client-side vulnerability that can be exploited by delivering a malicious file.
3. Therefore, the technique that likely occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 is T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.

**Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
