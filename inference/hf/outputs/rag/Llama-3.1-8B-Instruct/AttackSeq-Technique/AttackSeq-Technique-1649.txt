Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where PurpleFox evades detection by installing a rootkit driver and blocking incoming connections via a firewall rule. The goal is to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs indicate that the attacker has already used Defense Evasion techniques, specifically disabling or modifying the system firewall (T1562.004) to evade detection.
- The attacker has also used a rootkit (T1008) to establish a presence on the system.
- The goal is to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers, which is a Command and Control (C2) technique.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A (T1102-Web Service) is a technique used for establishing a C2 channel, but it typically involves using a web service, which is not directly related to the given scenario.
- Answer Choice B (T1205-Traffic Signaling) is a technique used for establishing a C2 channel, but it involves signaling through network traffic, which is not directly related to the given scenario.
- Answer Choice C (T1008-Rootkit) is a technique used for establishing persistence, not for establishing a C2 channel.
- Answer Choice D (T1014-Rootkit) is not a valid ATT&CK technique.

However, considering the ATT&CK technique T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, which is related to the question, and the fact that the attacker has already established a rootkit presence (T1008), the most plausible answer is actually T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication. However, this option is not available in the answer choices.

Given the available options, the closest match is T1102-Web Service, which is a broader category of C2 techniques. However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible answer is actually T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication, which is not available.

Final Answer: A
