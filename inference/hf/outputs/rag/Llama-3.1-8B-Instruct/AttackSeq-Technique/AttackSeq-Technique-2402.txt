To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack scenario where a victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link leading to trojanized files under the guise of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable the removal of attack artifacts through the script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker is trying to evade detection by removing indicators of the attack and deleting files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. The 'DeleteLeftovers' script is likely executed using a command or scripting interpreter, which would enable the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **B: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This technique involves creating or modifying user accounts to facilitate the attack. It does not directly relate to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It does not relate to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands. While it is related to command execution, it is more specific to Windows command shells, whereas the question does not specify the operating system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions a script named 'DeleteLeftovers', which implies the use of a scripting or command interpreter to execute the script.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is trying to remove attack artifacts, which aligns with the goal of the 'DeleteLeftovers' script.
   - Based on this analysis, the most plausible technique is the one that involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute the script.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, which is **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.
