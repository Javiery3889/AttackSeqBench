Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where APT10 used DLL sideloading for defense evasion. DLL sideloading is a technique used to load malicious code into a process without the need for administrative privileges. This technique is often used to evade detection by security software.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to defense evasion and DLL side-loading. However, the relevant TTP for gaining initial access is not directly related to defense evasion. The provided TTPs are more focused on the evasion aspect of the attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
To determine the most likely technique used to gain initial access, we need to consider the typical attack sequence. After evading detection using DLL sideloading, the attacker would likely use a technique to gain initial access to the network. 

- Option A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files is not directly related to gaining initial access through valid accounts.
- Option B and C: T1078-Valid Accounts is a plausible choice as it involves using valid accounts to gain access to the network. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access.
- Option D: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage is not directly related to gaining initial access through valid accounts.

Based on the typical attack sequence and the provided TTPs, the most plausible technique used to gain initial access after DLL sideloading is using valid accounts.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker used DLL sideloading for defense evasion, which is a technique used to evade detection.
2. After evading detection, the attacker would likely use a technique to gain initial access to the network.
3. The provided TTPs are related to defense evasion, but not directly related to gaining initial access.
4. Considering the typical attack sequence, using valid accounts is a common technique used to gain initial access.

Final Answer: B
