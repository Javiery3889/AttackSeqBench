To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor collecting data and archiving it in a custom storage file format. We need to find the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer the data from the victim's system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context about the attack sequence:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This TTP indicates that the attacker collected data from the local system.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This TTP suggests that the attacker exfiltrated data over a Command and Control (C2) channel.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method: This TTP indicates that the attacker archived data using a custom method.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a USB device, which is not directly related to the C2 channel or custom storage file format mentioned in the question.

B: T1129-Shared Modules: This technique involves loading shared modules, which is not directly related to data exfiltration or the custom storage file format.

C: T1590.001-Domain Properties: This technique involves modifying domain properties, which is not directly related to data exfiltration or the custom storage file format.

D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique matches the related TTP Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which suggests that the attacker exfiltrated data over a C2 channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker collected data from the local system using T1005-Data from Local System.
2. The attacker archived the collected data in a custom storage file format using T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method.
3. The attacker exfiltrated the archived data over a C2 channel using T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
