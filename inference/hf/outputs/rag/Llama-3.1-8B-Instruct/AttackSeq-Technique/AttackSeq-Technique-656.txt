Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where an attacker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents. This indicates that the attacker has already compromised the victim's device and is now looking to escalate their privileges or perform further actions.

Analysis of the Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange: This TTP is related to the exploitation of the DDE protocol, which is already mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP is related to the initial access vector used by the attacker, which is also mentioned in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the attacker has already gained initial access to the victim's device using a spearphishing attachment, the next logical step would be to escalate their privileges or perform further actions on the compromised device. 

Option A: T1090.002-External Proxy is not directly related to the exploitation of the DDE protocol or the initial access vector used by the attacker.

Option C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium is not relevant to the scenario described, as the attacker has already gained access to the device and is looking to perform further actions.

Option D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange is the same technique mentioned in the question, which is the exploitation of the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory. This is not the next step in the attack sequence.

Option B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is the most plausible next step in the attack sequence. This technique involves the use of command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, which is a common next step after gaining initial access to a device. The attacker may use this technique to escalate their privileges, move laterally, or perform further malicious activities on the compromised device.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker gained initial access to the victim's device using a spearphishing attachment (T1566.001).
2. The attacker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained further access to the device (T1559.002).
3. The next logical step would be to escalate their privileges or perform further actions on the compromised device, which would involve the use of a command and scripting interpreter (T1059).

Final Answer: B
