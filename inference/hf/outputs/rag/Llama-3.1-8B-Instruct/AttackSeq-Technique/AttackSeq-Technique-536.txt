To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used command and control (C2) by designing msdisp64.exe to download the next stage located in victim-specific folders on the C2 server. This implies a multi-stage attack where the attackers have already established a C2 channel and are now using it to download additional tools or payloads.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. We have three TTPs related to Command and Control (C2) and Defense Evasion:

1. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This TTP is related to the use of multiple stages or channels to communicate with the C2 server.
2. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This TTP is related to the transfer of tools or payloads from the C2 server to the victim's system.
3. T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location: This TTP is related to evading detection by matching the name or location of the malicious tool with a legitimate one.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1102-Web Service: This TTP is related to the use of web services for C2, but it doesn't directly relate to the multi-stage attack described in the question.

B: T1588.003-Code Signing Certificates: This TTP is related to code signing certificates, which is not directly related to the attack sequence described in the question.

C: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This TTP is directly related to the use of multiple stages or channels for C2, which aligns with the attack sequence described in the question.

D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job: This TTP is related to the use of scheduled tasks or jobs for persistence, but it doesn't directly relate to the multi-stage attack described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a multi-stage attack where attackers used C2 by designing msdisp64.exe to download the next stage.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves multi-stage channels (T1104) and the transfer of tools or payloads (T1105).
3. The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the use of multi-stage channels (T1104) to establish the C2 channel, followed by the transfer of tools or payloads (T1105) to the victim's system.

**Final Answer: C: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
