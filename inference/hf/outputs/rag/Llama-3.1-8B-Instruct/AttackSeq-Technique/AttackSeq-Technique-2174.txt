Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a targeted attack via spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents. The attackers achieved initial access, and we are asked to identify the technique used to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer, specifically the Microsoft Office version.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

The provided TTPs indicate that the attackers used spear phishing attachments to gain initial access. However, the question asks about the technique used to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- A: T1566-Phishing: This is the parent technique of T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, but it is too broad and does not specifically mention gathering information about software installed on the victim's computer.
- B: T1598-Phishing for Information: This technique involves using phishing to gather information about the victim, which could include software installed on their computer. This seems like a plausible answer.
- C: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data: This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not relevant to the scenario described in the question.
- D: T1648-Serverless Execution: This technique involves executing code without using a server, which is not relevant to gathering information about software installed on the victim's computer.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a targeted attack via spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents.
2. The attackers achieved initial access, and we are asked to identify the technique used to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer.
3. The related TTPs indicate that the attackers used spear phishing attachments to gain initial access.
4. Based on the information provided, the most plausible technique used to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer is T1598-Phishing for Information.

Final Answer: B
