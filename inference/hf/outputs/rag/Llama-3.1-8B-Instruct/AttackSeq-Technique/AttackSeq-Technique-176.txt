To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where an attacker, Infamous Chisel, achieves persistence by replacing a legitimate system binary (netd) and executing it with root privileges. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to run multi-call binary utilities like dropbear, ssh, and scp as root.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs provide context about the attack. They mention:
     - Privilege Escalation techniques: T1037.004-RC Scripts and T1543.002-Systemd Service.
     - Persistence technique: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary.
   - These TTPs suggest that the attacker is using various methods to escalate privileges and maintain persistence on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it's possible that the attacker used a scripting interpreter to run the multi-call binary utilities, it's not the most direct method described in the question.
   - **B: T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique involves using the Active Setup service to execute arbitrary code. However, the question doesn't mention Active Setup, and this technique doesn't directly relate to running multi-call binary utilities.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering software on a system. It's not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
   - **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves communication between processes. While it's possible that the attacker used IPC to communicate with the multi-call binary utilities, it's not the most direct method described in the question.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible technique is **T1543.002-Systemd Service**, which is mentioned in the related TTPs. This technique involves using a systemd service to execute arbitrary code, which aligns with the scenario described in the question. The attacker likely used a systemd service to run the multi-call binary utilities like dropbear, ssh, and scp as root.

**Final Answer: B**
