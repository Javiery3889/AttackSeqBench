To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking about the method FamousSparrow used to exfiltrate data after communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
     - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker is likely using a method to exfiltrate data, specifically over a channel or protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the initial communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.
   - Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection - This technique involves injecting code into a process, which does not directly relate to data exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery - This technique involves discovering security software, which is not relevant to data exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice D: This is a duplicate of Answer Choice A.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS, which is a C2 protocol.
   - The use of different multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted/decrypted communications suggests that the data is being exfiltrated over a C2 channel.
   - Given the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is described in Answer Choice A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
