To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence for the Regin malware and asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers for managing payloads and before stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File (related to encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers)
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes (related to hiding files)
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers (related to stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attack sequence involves:

1. Using EVFS containers for managing payloads (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File)
2. Hiding files to evade detection (T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes or T1564-Hide Artifacts)
3. Stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings (T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers)

Considering the options provided:

A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery is not directly related to the sequence described.
B: T1564.005-Hidden File System is a more specific technique related to hiding files, which aligns with the hiding step in the sequence.
C: T1218.011-Rundll32 is not directly related to the sequence described.
D: T1564-Hide Artifacts is a more general technique that includes hiding files, which aligns with the hiding step in the sequence.

Given the options, B: T1564.005-Hidden File System is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the execution of EVFS containers and before stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attack sequence starts with the execution of EVFS containers for managing payloads (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File).
2. To maintain persistence and evade detection, the attacker would likely hide the files used in the attack (T1564.005-Hidden File System).
3. After hiding the files, the attacker would steal credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings (T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers).

**Final Answer: B**
