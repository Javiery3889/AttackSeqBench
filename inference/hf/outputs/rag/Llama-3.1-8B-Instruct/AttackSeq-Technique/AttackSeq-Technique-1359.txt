To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack involving a first stage downloader (Rdws.exe) and a second stage PlugX file. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access through a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities".

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They are categorized into three tactics: Command and Control, Initial Access, and Defense Evasion.

- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages to communicate with the C2 server, which is relevant to the second stage PlugX file.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves gaining access to a system through a compromised website, which is relevant to the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising malicious files or processes to evade detection, which is relevant to the first stage downloader (Rdws.exe).

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service: This technique involves using spearphishing to gain access, but it's not directly related to the compromised website or the multi-stage channels.

B: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communication, but it's not directly related to the initial access or the multi-stage channels.

C: T1648-Serverless Execution: This technique involves executing code without a server, but it's not directly related to the compromised website or the multi-stage channels.

D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves gaining access to a system through a compromised website, which aligns with the question and the related TTPs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attack involving a compromised website, which suggests an Initial Access tactic.
2. The related TTPs for Initial Access include T1189-Drive-by Compromise, which matches the question.
3. The other related TTPs (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1036-Masquerading) are relevant to the second stage PlugX file and the first stage downloader, respectively, but they are not the primary technique that facilitated the adversary's method of gaining access.

**Final Answer: D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
