To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes FIN13 conducting reconnaissance by mapping victim networks and capturing credentials.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before they executed commands locally using JSPRAT.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials
   - These TTPs are related to initial access, discovery, and reconnaissance techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions FIN13 capturing credentials as part of reconnaissance. This aligns with T1589.001-Credentials, which is a reconnaissance technique.
   - The question also mentions executing commands locally using JSPRAT, which implies that FIN13 has gained some level of access to the system.
   - T1078.003-Local Accounts is a technique that involves the use of local accounts to gain access to a system, which could be a precursor to executing commands locally.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Given that FIN13 conducted reconnaissance by mapping victim networks and capturing credentials, the most likely previous step would be reconnaissance.
   - Among the answer choices, T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is a reconnaissance technique that aligns with the initial steps of the attack.
   - T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is a more general technique that encompasses the actions described in the question, such as mapping victim networks and capturing credentials.

5. Final Answer:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 conducted reconnaissance by gathering victim network information, which includes mapping networks and capturing credentials, before executing commands locally using JSPRAT.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:
   Final Answer: D
