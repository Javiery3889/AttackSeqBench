To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker receiving instructions from C2 servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. This implies that the attacker is attempting to evade detection by making the files less suspicious.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

These TTPs are related to encoding and decoding files, which aligns with the question's description of encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries - This technique is related to persistence and does not align with the encoding of configuration files.

B: T1498-Network Denial of Service - This technique is related to disruption of service and does not align with the encoding of configuration files.

C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood - This technique is related to disruption of service and does not align with the encoding of configuration files.

D: T1590.001-Domain Properties - This technique is related to domain name system (DNS) manipulation and does not align with the encoding of configuration files.

However, none of the above options directly match the description of encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. But, we can infer that the correct answer is related to encoding/decoding files.

Given the options, we can deduce that the closest related technique is T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File, which is a technique related to encoding files. However, this option is not available in the choices.

Since T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File is not an option, we can look at the other related TTP, T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. Although this technique is about deobfuscating/decoding, it is related to the encoding process.

Considering the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to encoding/decoding files, which is closest to T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attacker encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys.
2. The related TTPs are T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
3. Since T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File is not an option, we look at T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, which is related to encoding/decoding files.
4. Although T1140 is about deobfuscating/decoding, it is the closest related technique to the encoding process.

**Final Answer: D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
