To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where Sofacy uses obfuscated code to redirect users to malicious webpages or legitimate sites in their phishing campaigns. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to steal credentials from victims.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1589.001-Credentials: This technique is related to the collection of credentials, which is a key aspect of the question.
   - T1598.003-Spearphishing Link: This technique is related to phishing, which is also mentioned in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: Keylogging is a technique used to capture keystrokes, but it's not directly related to the phishing scenario described in the question.
   - **B: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves creating fake credentials, which is not directly related to the scenario where Sofacy attempts to steal existing credentials.
   - **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication**: This technique is related to authenticating to network devices, which is not relevant to the phishing scenario.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique is related to the use of obfuscated code, which is mentioned in the question as a means to redirect users to malicious webpages or legitimate sites.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Sofacy uses obfuscated code to redirect users to malicious webpages or legitimate sites in their phishing campaigns (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information), and then attempts to steal credentials from victims (T1589.001-Credentials).

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
