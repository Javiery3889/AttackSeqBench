To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the defense evasion strategy used by Charming Kitten before they used hidden tracking images to monitor when targets opened phishing emails. This implies that the technique in question is related to evading detection or hiding malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs include:
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link (This is the initial step of the attack, where the attackers send spearphishing links to their targets.)
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (This is another way of saying the same thing as the previous one, but with a different technique ID.)
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading (This is the technique we're looking for, which is related to defense evasion.)

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading - This is the technique related to defense evasion, which matches the context of the question. Masquerading involves hiding the true nature of a process or file, which could be used to evade detection before using hidden tracking images.
   - Answer Choice B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information - This technique is related to gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to defense evasion.
   - Answer Choice C: T1003.006-DCSync - This technique is related to lateral movement and does not fit the context of the question.
   - Answer Choice D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing - This technique is related to process hollowing, which is a technique used for persistence, not defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Charming Kitten used masquerading as part of their defense evasion strategy before using hidden tracking images to monitor when targets opened phishing emails.

Final Answer: A
