Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites, and scripts or HTML smuggling techniques are used for malware delivery. This indicates an initial access tactic where the attacker is attempting to compromise the victim's system.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1189-Drive-by Compromise is an initial access tactic where an attacker compromises a website to infect visitors' systems.
- T1027.006-HTML Smuggling is a defense evasion technique used to smuggle malicious code within HTML content, which can be used to deliver malware.
- T1608.004-Drive-by Target is related to the delivery of malware through drive-by downloads.

Based on the related TTPs, it appears that the question is describing a scenario where an attacker uses drive-by compromise to redirect victims to a compromised website, and then uses HTML smuggling to deliver malware.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites is not directly related to the initial access or malware delivery described in the question.
- B: T1566-Phishing is a tactic that involves tricking victims into performing a specific action, but it does not directly relate to the drive-by compromise and HTML smuggling described.
- C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the system or user, which is not directly related to the malware delivery described in the question.
- D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is a technique used to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link, which is not directly related to the drive-by compromise and HTML smuggling described.

Based on the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is drive-by compromise (T1189) followed by HTML smuggling (T1027.006) for malware delivery.

Final Answer: D
