To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker (TG-3279) using compromised credentials from pwdump6 to add scheduled system tasks to key resources. The attacker is using Conpee or Etso tools from a few key hosts, which are likely compromised. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated C2 (Command and Control) communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are focused on Command and Control (C2) tactics and the technique T1571-Non-Standard Port. This suggests that the question is related to C2 communication and the use of non-standard ports.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols - This technique is related to email protocols, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.

B: T1595-Active Scanning - This technique is related to network scanning, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.

C: T1571-Non-Standard Port - This technique is directly related to the use of non-standard ports, which matches the description in the question. This technique is used for C2 communication, and the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic is a common example of this technique.

D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure - This technique is related to acquiring infrastructure, which is not directly related to the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attacker using compromised credentials and tools for C2 communication.
2. The related TTPs focus on C2 tactics and the technique T1571-Non-Standard Port.
3. The question specifically mentions the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which is a common example of T1571-Non-Standard Port.
4. Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of T1571-Non-Standard Port for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
