Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where Gamaredon's malware scans all drives to locate sensitive files, including local, removable, and network drives. This indicates that the malware is gathering information about the system and its environment.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media: This TTP involves an adversary collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This TTP involves an adversary gathering information about the system's files and directories.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the adversary is gathering information about the system and its environment. The question states that the malware scanned all drives to locate sensitive files, which aligns with the TTPs provided.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: T1199-Trusted Relationship: This technique involves establishing a trusted relationship with a user or system, which is not directly related to scanning drives for sensitive files.
- B: T1498.002-Reflection Amplification: This technique involves using a reflection amplification attack, which is not related to scanning drives for sensitive files.
- C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is a possible next step after scanning all drives for sensitive files.
- D: T1074-Data Staged: This technique involves staging data for exfiltration, which is a possible next step after collecting sensitive files.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after scanning all drives for sensitive files would be to collect data from network shared drives, as it aligns with the TTPs provided and the attack scenario described.

Final Answer: C
