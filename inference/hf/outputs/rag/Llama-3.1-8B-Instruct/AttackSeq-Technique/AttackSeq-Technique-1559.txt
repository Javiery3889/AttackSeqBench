To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the ATT&CK technique that APT42 used to complement their credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors before gaining initial access via spear phishing and MFA bypass.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (general phishing)
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear phishing link)
   - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link (spear phishing link)

   These TTPs indicate that the attackers used phishing and spear phishing to gain initial access. However, the question is asking about the technique used to complement credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**: This technique involves installing a root certificate to bypass certificate validation, which could be used to complement credential harvesting efforts by allowing the attackers to establish a secure communication channel with their command and control (C2) server.
   - **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing new capabilities, which is not directly related to complementing credential harvesting efforts.
   - **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**: This technique involves using social media accounts for reconnaissance, which is not directly related to complementing credential harvesting efforts.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves using internal spear phishing, which is a type of phishing but not directly related to complementing credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Based on the related TTPs, the attackers used phishing and spear phishing to gain initial access. To complement their credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors, they would need a technique that allows them to establish a secure communication channel with their C2 server. Installing a root certificate (T1553.004) would enable them to bypass certificate validation and establish a secure connection.

5. **Final Answer**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is installing a root certificate to complement credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors. 

Final Answer: A
