To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used by an attacker, specifically after the Aria-body backdoor has collected information from the victim's machine. The question is focused on the discovery phase, and we need to determine which technique occurred before gathering data on installed software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs provided are all related to the discovery tactic, which is the initial phase of the attack where the attacker gathers information about the victim's system. The techniques mentioned are:
   - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and other system details.
   - T1518-Software Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the software installed on the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: Based on the related TTPs, we can see that T1518-Software Discovery is the technique that involves gathering information about installed software. Since the question asks what occurred before gathering data on installed software, we need to look for a technique that would logically precede T1518-Software Discovery.

   - T1090.001-Internal Proxy and T1069.003-Cloud Groups are not directly related to the discovery of system or network information.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is a technique related to the collection of sensitive information, but it is not directly related to the discovery of system or network information.

   - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1082-System Information Discovery are both related to the discovery of system and network information, which would logically precede the discovery of installed software.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of techniques would be:
   - First, the attacker would gather information about the system network configuration (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery).
   - Then, the attacker would gather information about the system (T1082-System Information Discovery).
   - Finally, the attacker would gather information about the installed software (T1518-Software Discovery).

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of techniques is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery and T1082-System Information Discovery, but the question asks for a single technique that occurred prior to gathering data on installed software. Since T1082-System Information Discovery is the technique that would most likely occur before gathering data on installed software, the final answer is:

Final Answer: C
