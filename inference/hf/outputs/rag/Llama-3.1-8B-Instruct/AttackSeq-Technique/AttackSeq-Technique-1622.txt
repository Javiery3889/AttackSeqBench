Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario where APT28 is scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed after this step as part of their Discovery tactic.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks

These TTPs indicate that the attackers are engaging in reconnaissance and discovery activities, specifically scanning IP blocks and remotely discovering systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the question is asking for the next step in the Discovery tactic after scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. 

- Option A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery is not directly related to the scenario described.
- Option B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is a technique used for exfiltration, which is not the next step in the Discovery tactic.
- Option C: T1055.009-Proc Memory is a technique used for process memory manipulation, which is not directly related to the scenario described.
- Option D: T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most likely next step in the Discovery tactic, as it involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the scenario of scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes APT28 scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems as part of their Discovery tactic.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attackers are engaging in reconnaissance and discovery activities.
3. The next step in the Discovery tactic would involve gathering information about the identified vulnerable systems.
4. T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most likely next step, as it involves gathering information about remote systems.

Final Answer: D
