To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Infamous Chisel collects files from the local system and application directories. The goal is to exfiltrate these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial action of Infamous Chisel collecting files.
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which could involve using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories: This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection, which could be related to the use of a Tor hidden service.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Answer Choice A and B are the same, which is a duplicate. 
   - Answer Choice C, T1614-System Location Discovery, is not relevant to the scenario as it involves discovering the system's location, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - Answer Choice D, T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood, is not relevant to the scenario as it involves overwhelming the system with traffic, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - Answer Choice A/B, T1020-Automated Exfiltration, is the most relevant technique as it involves exfiltrating data using automated tools, which aligns with the use of Infamous Chisel to collect and exfiltrate files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where files are collected from the local system and application directories using Infamous Chisel.
   - The goal is to exfiltrate these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - Based on the related TTPs, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique as it involves exfiltrating data using automated tools, which aligns with the use of Infamous Chisel.

Final Answer: B
