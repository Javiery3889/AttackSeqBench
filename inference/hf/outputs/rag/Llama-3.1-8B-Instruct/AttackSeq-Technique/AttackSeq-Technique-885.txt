To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Rocra attackers infected remote hosts in the same network during the lateral movement phase, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question asks about the sequence of techniques used by the Rocra attackers during the lateral movement phase. The question specifically mentions that the attackers infected remote hosts in the same network. This implies that the attackers are moving laterally within the network.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

These TTPs are both related to lateral movement, which is the tactic in question. T1080-Taint Shared Content involves the attackers contaminating shared content to spread malware, while T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer involves the attackers transferring tools to remote hosts.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given that the question asks about the sequence of techniques before the attackers infected remote hosts, we need to determine which technique is more likely to occur before the infection of remote hosts.

T1080-Taint Shared Content is a technique that involves contaminating shared content, which can be a precursor to lateral movement. If the attackers contaminate shared content, it's likely that the infected content will be accessed by other hosts in the network, potentially leading to the infection of remote hosts.

T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is a technique that involves transferring tools to remote hosts, which is a direct action that can lead to the infection of remote hosts. However, it's more likely that the attackers would contaminate shared content before transferring tools to remote hosts.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers need to prepare the environment for lateral movement.
2. Contaminating shared content (T1080-Taint Shared Content) is a way to prepare the environment for lateral movement.
3. The contaminated shared content can be accessed by other hosts in the network.
4. The attackers can then transfer tools to the infected hosts (T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer) to further compromise the network.

**Final Answer: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
