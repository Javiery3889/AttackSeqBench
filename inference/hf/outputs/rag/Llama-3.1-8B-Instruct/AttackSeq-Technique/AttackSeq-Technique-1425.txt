To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving malware like Alchimist, Gimmick, and macOS.Macma, which are all types of malware. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors but before the use of persistence agents.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to persistence, which is a tactic used by attackers to maintain access to a system or network over time. The specific techniques mentioned are:

- T1543.001-Launch Agent: This technique involves using a launch agent to execute a malicious payload.
- T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification: This technique involves modifying the Unix shell configuration to execute a malicious payload.
- T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves modifying the boot or logon process to execute a malicious payload.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which is not directly related to the persistence techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain, which is not directly related to the persistence techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution: This technique involves executing a payload in response to a specific event, which is related to the Unix Shell Configuration Modification (T1546.004) technique mentioned in the related TTPs.

D: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery: This technique involves discovering cloud services, which is not directly related to the persistence techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the use of Unix Shell Configuration Modification (T1546.004) to execute a malicious payload, which is a form of event-triggered execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors, which is not directly related to the persistence techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.
2. The question asks for the technique that occurred before the use of persistence agents, which suggests that the technique must be related to the execution of a malicious payload.
3. The related TTPs mention Unix Shell Configuration Modification (T1546.004) as a technique for executing a malicious payload.
4. Event Triggered Execution (T1546) is a technique that involves executing a payload in response to a specific event, which aligns with the Unix Shell Configuration Modification technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
