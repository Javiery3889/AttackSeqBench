To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 initially gained access via spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents. However, it asks about the technique that occurred before this initial access, specifically after bots scanned IP ranges and identified vulnerable systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**: The related TTPs are focused on Initial Access, with a specific technique being Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001). This indicates that the attack started with a phishing campaign, but we are looking for the technique that occurred before this.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1564.003-Hidden Window**: This technique involves hiding a window or process to evade detection. It doesn't seem directly related to scanning IP ranges or identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning a network for hosts to identify potential targets. This seems like a plausible step before identifying vulnerable systems.
   - **C: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves exploiting a system service to gain access. While it's related to Initial Access, it's more about exploiting a service rather than scanning for vulnerable systems.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**: This is a duplicate of option B, which is likely a mistake in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question mentions bots scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems before the initial access via spear phishing.
   - This suggests a reconnaissance phase where the attackers are gathering information about potential targets.
   - Active Scanning (T1595) is a technique that involves scanning a network for hosts to identify potential targets, which aligns with the described behavior.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used Active Scanning (T1595) to identify vulnerable systems before sending spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.

Final Answer: B
