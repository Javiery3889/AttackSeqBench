To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an adversary who attempted to clean up traces of their intrusions and then utilized PsLogList as part of their discovery efforts. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary cleaned up traces and before they used PsLogList.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal (clearing Windows event logs)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs (clearing Windows event logs)
   - These TTPs indicate that the adversary is attempting to evade detection by removing indicators of their presence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access - This technique is not directly related to the adversary's actions of cleaning up traces or using PsLogList.
   - Answer Choice B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft - This technique is not directly related to the adversary's actions of cleaning up traces or using PsLogList.
   - Answer Choice C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services - This technique is not directly related to the adversary's actions of cleaning up traces or using PsLogList.
   - Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal - This technique is directly related to the adversary's action of cleaning up traces, specifically clearing Windows event logs.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question states that the adversary attempted to clean up traces of their intrusions, which aligns with the T1070-Indicator Removal technique.
   - The question also states that the adversary used PsLogList as part of their discovery efforts, but this is not directly related to the question of what technique occurred after cleaning up traces and before using PsLogList.
   - Since the question asks for the technique that occurred after cleaning up traces and before using PsLogList, we can infer that the correct answer is the technique that is directly related to cleaning up traces.

5. Final Answer:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary used T1070-Indicator Removal (clearing Windows event logs) after attempting to clean up traces and before using PsLogList.
   - Therefore, the final answer is:
   Final Answer: D
