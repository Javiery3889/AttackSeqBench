To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking about the sequence of techniques used by Regin before it utilized its RAT features for collection. It specifically mentions that Regin gathered information on processes and memory utilization, and monitored network traffic for IIS web servers.

2. Analyze the Related TTPs:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking (not directly relevant to the question)
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery (gathering system information)
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery (gathering process information)
   - These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the system and its processes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Given that Regin gathered information on processes and memory utilization, and monitored network traffic for IIS web servers, we need to find a technique that aligns with this sequence.
   - Answer choice A (T1090-Proxy) is not directly related to gathering system or process information.
   - Answer choice B (T1112-Modify Registry) could be a possible next step, but it's not directly related to the information gathered in the previous steps.
   - Answer choice C (T1056-Input Capture) is a technique that involves capturing keyboard and mouse input, which is not directly related to the information gathered in the previous steps.
   - Answer choice D (T1049-System Network Connections Discovery) is a technique that involves discovering network connections, which aligns with the system information discovery and process discovery techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

4. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Based on the related TTPs and the information gathered in the question, the most plausible sequence of techniques is:
     1. Gather system information (T1082-System Information Discovery)
     2. Gather process information (T1057-Process Discovery)
     3. Discover system network connections (T1049-System Network Connections Discovery)
   - Therefore, the final answer is:
   Final Answer: D
