Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker using TDrop2, which evaded detection through process hollowing and disguised payload retrieval for defense evasion. The question asks for the next likely ATT&CK technique used to gather details about the infected system.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to defense evasion, specifically process hollowing (T1055.012). This technique involves creating a new process and then hollowing out the original process to evade detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the attacker has already used process hollowing for defense evasion, the next likely step would be to gather information about the infected system. 

- Option A (T1106-Native API) is not directly related to gathering system information.
- Option B (T1082-System Information Discovery) is a good fit as it involves gathering system information, which would be a logical next step after evading detection.
- Option C (T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion) is also a defense evasion technique, which doesn't align with the goal of gathering system information.
- Option D (T1560.002-Archive via Library) is not directly related to gathering system information.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker used process hollowing (T1055.012) for defense evasion.
2. The goal is to gather information about the infected system.
3. The most logical next step would be to use a technique that gathers system information.

Final Answer: B
