To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files for initial access and the double extension trick for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.007-Double File Extension (double extension trick)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files)
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker used a spearphishing attack to gain initial access and employed the double extension trick to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application-layer protocols to communicate with compromised systems. Given the context of the question, this seems like a plausible choice, as it could be used for communication.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While it's related to defense evasion, it doesn't directly relate to communication with compromised systems.
   - **C: T1010-Application Window Discovery:** This technique involves discovering open application windows on a system. It's not directly related to communication with compromised systems.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This is the parent technique for spearphishing, but it's too broad and doesn't specifically relate to communication with compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving spearphishing and the double extension trick for defense evasion.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used spearphishing and the double extension trick.
   - The question asks which technique facilitated communication with compromised systems.
   - Given the context, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible choice, as it involves communication with compromised systems.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   Final Answer: A
