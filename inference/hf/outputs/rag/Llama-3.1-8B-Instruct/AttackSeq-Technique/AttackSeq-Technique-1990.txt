To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where HTML Smuggling (T1027.006) is used to bypass security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW (Mark of the Web).

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading
   - These TTPs are all related to Defense Evasion techniques, which is the tactic in question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the technique that ensures malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW after HTML Smuggling.
   - The correct answer should be a technique that is related to avoiding detection or evasion of security controls, specifically related to MOTW.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates: This technique is not directly related to evasion of security controls or MOTW.
     - B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure: This technique is not directly related to evasion of security controls or MOTW.
     - C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls: This technique is a parent technique that includes T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass, which is directly related to avoiding MOTW.
     - D: T1564.009-Resource Forking: This technique is not directly related to evasion of security controls or MOTW.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where HTML Smuggling is used to bypass security controls.
   - The goal is to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW.
   - The related TTPs include T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass, which is a technique that is directly related to avoiding MOTW.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to use T1553-Subvert Trust Controls, which includes T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass.

Final Answer: C
