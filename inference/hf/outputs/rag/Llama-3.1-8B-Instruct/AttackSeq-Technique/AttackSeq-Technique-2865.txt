To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes Suckfly's attempt to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network after scanning the corporate internal network for open ports. This indicates that Suckfly is trying to expand its presence within the network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This technique involves using spearphishing to trick users into performing certain actions that aid the attacker's lateral movement.
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to other systems within the network to facilitate further lateral movement.
   - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery: This technique involves discovering available services on the network, which can be used to identify potential entry points for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an existing remote service session to gain unauthorized access to a system. While it could be used for lateral movement, it doesn't directly relate to the initial scanning for open ports or the use of spearphishing.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. Given the context of scanning for open ports, this technique seems plausible as it involves exploiting services that are already open.
   - **C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This technique involves cracking Kerberos tickets to gain access to a system. While it's a form of lateral movement, it's more specific to Kerberos and doesn't directly relate to scanning for open ports.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access to a system. Given the context of the question, this seems less likely as it involves public-facing applications rather than internal network services.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services that are already open, which is consistent with the initial scanning for open ports.

**Final Answer: B**
