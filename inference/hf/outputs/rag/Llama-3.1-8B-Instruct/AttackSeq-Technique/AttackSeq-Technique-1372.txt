To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first steals personal contact information using social media mobile apps, and then uses HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials
     - Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link
   - These TTPs are all related to reconnaissance, which is the initial phase of the attack. They involve gathering information about the victim, such as their contact information, credentials, or phishing them through services or links.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails. This implies that the technique should be related to reconnaissance, as the attacker is gathering information about the victim before attempting to harvest their credentials.
   - Answer choice A (T1059.002-AppleScript) is a technique related to execution, not reconnaissance. It's unlikely to be the correct answer.
   - Answer choice B (T1558.002-Silver Ticket) is a technique related to credential dumping and stealing, which is not directly related to the reconnaissance phase.
   - Answer choice C (T1590-Gather Victim Network Information) is a technique related to reconnaissance, which involves gathering information about the victim's network. This could be a plausible answer, but it's not the most specific match for the given scenario.
   - Answer choice D (T1606-Forge Web Credentials) is not a valid ATT&CK technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first gathers information about the victim using social media mobile apps (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service or T1598.003-Spearphishing Link) and then uses HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials (T1589.001-Credentials).
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gathered credentials (T1589.001-Credentials) and then used those credentials to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the technique that is most closely related to gathering credentials.

Final Answer: C
