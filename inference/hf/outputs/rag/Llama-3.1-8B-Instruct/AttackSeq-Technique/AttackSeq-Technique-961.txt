To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker executing a batch script to deploy the RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX). The goal is to maintain the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion (not directly relevant to the question)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (relevant to modifying system startup configurations)
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (relevant to modifying system startup configurations)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques related to persistence are the most relevant to the question. The question mentions modifying system startup configurations to maintain the attack presence.

- Option A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise is not relevant to the question as it involves exploiting a web application vulnerability.
- Option B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique as it involves modifying system startup configurations to maintain persistence.
- Option C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path is not directly relevant to the question as it involves manipulating file paths.
- Option D: T1204-User Execution is not relevant to the question as it involves executing a file or process.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker executed a batch script to deploy the RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX).
2. The goal is to maintain the attack presence by modifying system startup configurations.
3. The related TTPs indicate that the techniques related to persistence are the most relevant.
4. Among the persistence techniques, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant as it involves modifying system startup configurations.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
