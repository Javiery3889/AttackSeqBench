To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a rootkit, CEIDPageLock, gathering browsing data on victims and communicating with hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for the rootkit to establish communication with its C&C domains.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This suggests that the initial access was gained through a drive-by compromise, which is a common method for delivering malware.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS: This indicates that the communication with the C&C domains is likely done through DNS protocol.
- Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target: This suggests that the rootkit is designed to target drive-by compromises.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software: This technique is unrelated to the described scenario, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities in customer relationship management software.

B: T1205-Traffic Signaling: This technique involves signaling to the attacker that a victim has been compromised, but it doesn't directly relate to the communication with C&C domains.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using an application-layer protocol to communicate with the C&C server. Given that the related TTPs mention T1071.004-DNS, this choice seems plausible, as DNS is an application-layer protocol.

D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique is already mentioned in the related TTPs as the initial access method, but it doesn't directly relate to the communication with C&C domains.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The rootkit, CEIDPageLock, gathers browsing data on victims, indicating that the initial access was gained through a drive-by compromise (T1189).
2. The rootkit communicates with hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which suggests that the communication is done through an application-layer protocol.
3. Given the related TTPs, the most likely application-layer protocol used for communication is DNS (T1071.004-DNS).

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
