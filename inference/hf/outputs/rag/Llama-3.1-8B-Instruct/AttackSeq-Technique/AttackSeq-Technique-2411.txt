To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker establishing communication by periodically checking web pages for one-way messages containing the C2 node address. This indicates that the attacker is using a method to receive information from the C2 server, which is a key component of Command and Control (C2) tactics.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

The first related TTP, T1102.003-One-Way Communication, is directly related to the question, as it describes an attacker receiving information from a C2 server. The second related TTP, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, is also relevant, as it describes data transfer to a C2 server.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This technique is directly related to data transfer to a C2 server, which aligns with the question's description of receiving information from the C2 server.

B: T1098-Account Manipulation - This technique is not directly related to the question's description of receiving information from a C2 server.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique is related to executing commands or scripts, but it does not directly relate to receiving information from a C2 server.

D: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository - This technique is related to exfiltrating data to a code repository, which is not directly related to receiving information from a C2 server.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question describes an attacker establishing communication by periodically checking web pages for one-way messages containing the C2 node address.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the attacker is using a method to receive information from the C2 server (T1102.003-One-Way Communication).
3. The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve data transfer to the C2 server, which is described by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
