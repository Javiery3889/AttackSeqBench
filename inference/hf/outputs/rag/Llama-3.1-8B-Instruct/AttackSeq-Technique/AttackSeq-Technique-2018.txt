To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1.  Analyze the Question:
    - The question is asking about a technique that ensures the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts. This implies that the technique is related to persistence, as it needs to remain active even after the device restarts.

2.  Analyze the Related TTPs:
    - The related TTPs are:
        - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass
        - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery
        - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614-System Location Discovery
    - These TTPs are related to evasion, discovery, and location discovery. However, none of them directly relate to persistence or autostart.

3.  Compare and Evaluate:
    - Looking at the answer choices, we need to find the one that aligns with the concept of persistence or autostart.
    - A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass is related to evasion, which is not relevant to the question.
    - B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is related to persistence and autostart, which aligns with the question.
    - C: T1546.014-Emond is not a valid ATT&CK technique.
    - D: T1125-Video Capture is related to data capture, which is not relevant to the question.

4.  Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    - The question is asking about a technique that ensures the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
    - The related TTPs do not directly relate to persistence or autostart, but we need to find the answer choice that aligns with this concept.
    - Based on the answer choices, B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the only one that relates to persistence and autostart.

5.  Final Answer:
    - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Final Answer: B
