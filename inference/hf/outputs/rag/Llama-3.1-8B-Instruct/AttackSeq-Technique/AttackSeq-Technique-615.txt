To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely involved the use of tools for enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports before gaining initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force: This technique involves using brute force to guess or crack passwords.
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.003-Local Accounts: This technique involves creating new local accounts on internal hosts.
   - The question also mentions enumerating services and scanning ports, which are related to reconnaissance and discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves using tools to scan for open ports and services on a target system. It aligns with the actions of enumerating services and scanning ports.
   - **B: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves gathering information about domain properties, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
   - **C: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to mask the attacker's IP address, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
   - **D: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using BITS jobs to transfer files, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question mentions enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports before gaining initial access.
   - T1595-Active Scanning is the most relevant technique that involves scanning for open ports and services, which aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - Brute force authentication (T1110) and creating local accounts (T1078.003) are related to gaining initial access, but they are not directly related to the actions of enumerating services and scanning ports.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to scanning for open ports and services, which is T1595-Active Scanning.

Final Answer: A
