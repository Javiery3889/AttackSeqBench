To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services

   These TTPs are related to initial access, persistence, and the exploitation of public-facing applications and external remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs**: This technique is related to the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for command and control (C2) communication, which is more related to command and control and not directly related to initial access.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique is related to modifying the Windows registry to execute malicious code, which is more related to persistence and not directly related to initial access.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is related to the transfer of tools or malware into a victim's network, which could be a part of initial access but is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers.
   - **D: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique is related to the exploitation of external remote services, which is directly related to the exploitation of external servers by FIN13.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the exploitation of external servers is related to T1133-External Remote Services.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the exploitation of external remote services before FIN13 established initial access.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the exploitation of external remote services, which is **D: T1133-External Remote Services**.
