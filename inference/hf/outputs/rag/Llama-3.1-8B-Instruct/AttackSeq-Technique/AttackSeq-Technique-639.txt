To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attacker evading detections through CPU core checks and utilizing large null-padded files. This suggests the attacker is using techniques to evade detection and potentially hide their malicious activity. The question then asks about emitting network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data for communication with the server.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
3. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.001-Binary Padding

These TTPs are all related to defense evasion techniques, which aligns with the attacker's goal of evading detections. T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File and T1027.001-Binary Padding are specifically related to encoding or padding files to evade detection, which matches the description of utilizing large null-padded files.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This technique is related to executing malicious code at boot or logon, which doesn't directly relate to the description of emitting network beacons.

B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols - This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control (C2) communication, but it doesn't specifically involve hardcoded header values or encrypted data.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application-layer protocols for C2 communication, which could involve hardcoded header values and encrypted data. This aligns with the description of emitting network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data.

D: T1037.003-Network Logon Script - This technique involves using network logon scripts for C2 communication, which doesn't specifically involve hardcoded header values or encrypted data.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker is evading detections through CPU core checks and utilizing large null-padded files, indicating they are using defense evasion techniques.
2. The related TTPs suggest the attacker is using techniques to encode or pad files to evade detection.
3. The question asks about emitting network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data, which suggests a C2 communication technique.
4. Based on the related TTPs and the description, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible technique, as it involves using application-layer protocols for C2 communication, which could involve hardcoded header values and encrypted data.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
