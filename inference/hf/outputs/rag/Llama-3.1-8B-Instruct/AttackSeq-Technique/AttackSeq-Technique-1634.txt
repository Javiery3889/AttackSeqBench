To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker using SUNSPOT malware. The sequence includes AES128-CBC encryption to protect source code files for defense evasion and monitoring running processes to detect MsBuild.exe during the discovery phase.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker is trying to gather information about the system (Discovery) and evade detection by protecting their files (Defense Evasion).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A (T1027.006-HTML Smuggling):** This technique is related to web application attacks and doesn't fit the context of the question, which involves SUNSPOT malware and MsBuild.exe.
   - **Option B (T1564-Hide Artifacts):** This technique involves hiding files, network, or other artifacts to evade detection. While it's related to defense evasion, it doesn't specifically involve encryption or monitoring processes.
   - **Option C (T1056.003-Web Portal Capture):** This technique involves capturing web portal credentials, which is unrelated to the context of the question.
   - **Option D (T1053-Scheduled Task/Job):** This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious activities. However, it doesn't directly relate to the encryption and process monitoring described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that the attacker used AES128-CBC encryption to protect source code files for defense evasion. This action is related to **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (Defense Evasion).
   - The next action is monitoring running processes to detect MsBuild.exe during the discovery phase. This action is related to **T1057-Process Discovery** (Discovery).
   - Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible technique that occurred before monitoring running processes is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**, which is related to defense evasion.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (Defense Evasion) before monitoring running processes to detect MsBuild.exe during the discovery phase.

Final Answer: B
