Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence where APT15 achieved persistence by installing the RoyalDNS backdoor. The question asks for the technique that likely occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. The TTPs are related to credential access and persistence. Specifically, T1078.002-Domain Accounts and T1003.006-DCSync are related to obtaining domain administrator credentials, while T1546.008-Accessibility Features is related to persistence.

Comparison and Evaluation:
To achieve persistence by installing the RoyalDNS backdoor, APT15 likely needed to obtain domain administrator credentials first. The related TTPs suggest that the technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts is related to obtaining domain administrator credentials. 

Considering the answer choices, B: T1078-Valid Accounts is the most plausible sequence of TTPs. This is because T1078-Valid Accounts is a parent technique that includes T1078.002-Domain Accounts, which is related to obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
2. The obtained credentials are likely in the form of valid domain accounts.
3. With valid domain accounts, APT15 can install the RoyalDNS backdoor to achieve persistence.

Final Answer: B
