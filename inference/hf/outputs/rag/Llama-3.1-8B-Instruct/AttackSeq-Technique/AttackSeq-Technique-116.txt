To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where Agrius exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) to upload webshells for lateral movement. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs include:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (exploiting a vulnerability to gain initial access)
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service (registering a backdoor as a service for persistence)
     - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services (registering a backdoor as a service for persistence, specifically using an external remote service)
   - These TTPs indicate that the attacker gained initial access through exploiting a public-facing application and then achieved persistence by registering a backdoor as a service.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**: This technique is related to evading detection by excluding files or paths from being scanned, which doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a vulnerability or registering a backdoor as a service.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which might be used for command and control (C2) but doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a vulnerability or registering a backdoor as a service.
   - **C: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This technique involves accessing a network device using the command-line interface, which might be used for lateral movement but doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a vulnerability or registering a backdoor as a service.
   - **D: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves adding, changing, or modifying system services to establish persistence, which aligns with the goal of registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an attack scenario where the attacker exploited a vulnerability to gain initial access and then achieved persistence by registering a backdoor as a service.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the attacker used exploitation of a public-facing application for initial access and registering a backdoor as a service for persistence.
   - Based on this information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to adding, changing, or modifying system services to establish persistence.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **Final Answer: D**
