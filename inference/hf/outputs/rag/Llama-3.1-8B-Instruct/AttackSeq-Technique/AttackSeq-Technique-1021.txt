To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents on a compromised system. Then, Gamaredon sends emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred in this scenario.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are primarily focused on Initial Access, specifically T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment. This technique involves tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the related TTPs:

A: T1546.002-Screensaver - This technique involves using a screensaver to execute malicious code. However, the question does not mention screensavers, so this option is unlikely.

B: T1204-User Execution - This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file or process. Given that the question mentions malicious attachments sent via email, this option seems plausible.

C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute malicious code. However, the question does not mention DCOM, so this option is unlikely.

D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing - This technique involves using spearphishing to trick an internal user into performing a specific action. While spearphishing is mentioned in the related TTPs, the question specifically mentions malicious attachments, which is more closely related to T1204-User Execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents, which is a common precursor to user execution.
2. The malicious macros are sent via email attachments, which is a classic example of spearphishing.
3. The related TTPs mention T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, which involves tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment.
4. Based on the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file or process, which is T1204-User Execution.

**Final Answer: B: T1204-User Execution**
