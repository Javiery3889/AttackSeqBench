Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the PlugX variant communicates with C2 domains using web services like HTTP over ports 80, 443, 53, and 8000. This indicates that the malware is using web protocols to establish communication with its C2 server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is also relevant to the question as the malware is using ports 53 and 8000, which are not standard HTTP or HTTPS ports.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, which is not directly related to the communication method used by the malware.
- B: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using web services, which is relevant to the question, but it is a broader category that includes various web services, not specifically web protocols.
- C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication: This technique involves bidirectional communication using web services, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which is not directly related to the communication method used by the malware.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware used web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) to communicate with its C2 server, which is a more specific and relevant technique compared to the other options.

Final Answer: B
