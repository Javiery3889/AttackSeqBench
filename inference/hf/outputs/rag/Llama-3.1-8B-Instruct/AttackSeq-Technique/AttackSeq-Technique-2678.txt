Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack scenario involving ZoxPNG, a malware, communicating with a C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files. The malware then registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with a C2 server.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography: This technique involves hiding malicious data within non-malicious files, such as images.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the focus is on the communication between ZoxPNG and the C2 server. The use of HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files suggests that the communication is happening over a web protocol. 

Option A and D are incorrect because T1106-Native API refers to the use of native APIs, which is not relevant to the scenario described. Option C is also incorrect because T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow refers to the technique of accessing sensitive information, which is not related to the communication between ZoxPNG and the C2 server.

Option B, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, is the most plausible answer because it involves using web protocols for communication, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes ZoxPNG communicating with a C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files.
2. The related TTPs indicate that the communication is happening over a web protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
3. The use of web protocols for communication aligns with Option B, T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: B
