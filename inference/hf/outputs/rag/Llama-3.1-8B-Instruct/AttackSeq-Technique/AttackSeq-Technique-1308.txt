Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack scenario where a malicious file named System.doc is executed, and FireEye's ExploitGuard detects anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel. This indicates that the attack is related to the Execution tactic and involves a malicious file.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs are focused on the Execution tactic, specifically T1204.002-Malicious File, which involves the use of a malicious file to execute an attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer choice A, T1056-Input Capture, is related to the Collection tactic and involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file.
- Answer choice B, T1491-Defacement, is related to the Impact tactic and involves defacing a system or website, which is not relevant to the execution of a malicious file.
- Answer choice C, T1098-Account Manipulation, is related to the Persistence tactic and involves manipulating user accounts, which is not directly related to the execution of a malicious file.
- Answer choice D, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, is related to the Execution tactic and involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs, which could be a precursor to executing a malicious file.

Based on the related TTPs and the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve creating or modifying a scheduled task or job to execute the malicious file, which is then detected by FireEye's ExploitGuard.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malicious file System.doc is executed, indicating the Execution tactic.
2. The execution of the malicious file is likely preceded by creating or modifying a scheduled task or job to run the file.
3. FireEye's ExploitGuard detects anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel, indicating that the malicious file is interacting with the system in an unexpected way.

Final Answer: D
