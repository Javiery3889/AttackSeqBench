To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario where Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to a C2 (Command and Control) server. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
2. Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

These TTPs are related to exfiltration, which is the tactic of extracting data from a system or network. T1020-Automated Exfiltration refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data, while T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel, which is a communication channel established by an attacker to control compromised systems.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a technique that involves the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits - This technique is related to data transfer, but it doesn't specifically involve exfiltration over a C2 channel.

B: T1137.006-Add-ins - This technique is related to the use of add-ins, but it's not directly related to exfiltration or C2 channels.

C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - This technique matches the description in the related TTPs and the context of the question. It involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is consistent with the scenario described.

D: T1106-Native API - This technique is related to the use of native APIs, but it's not directly related to exfiltration or C2 channels.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes an attack scenario involving the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
2. The related TTPs provide context about exfiltration techniques, specifically T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
3. Answer choice C, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, directly matches the description in the related TTPs and the context of the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
