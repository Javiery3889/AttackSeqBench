To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers have already set up malware within the infrastructure software of the attacked organization for defense evasion. The next step in the attack sequence is to explore the financial systems using remote administration tools.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry - This TTP involves modifying the registry to evade detection.
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion - This TTP involves exploiting vulnerabilities to evade detection.
3. Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft - This TTP involves stealing financial information.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
To explore the financial systems using remote administration tools, the attackers would likely need to gain access to the systems first. Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers have already set up malware for defense evasion (T1112-Modify Registry and T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion). The next step would be to gain access to the financial systems, which would likely involve discovering the systems that contain financial data.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers have set up malware for defense evasion (T1112-Modify Registry and T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion).
2. To explore the financial systems, the attackers need to discover the systems that contain financial data.
3. The most likely TTP to discover systems is T1018-Remote System Discovery, which involves discovering remote systems by using various methods.

**Final Answer: A: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
