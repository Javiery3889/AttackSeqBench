To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where Trojan.APT.Seinup uses Google Docs to evade callback detection through redirection and encrypted communications via SSL during its malicious communications. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this action.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading

These TTPs are related to command and control (C2) and defense evasion techniques. Protocol or Service Impersonation (T1001.003) involves an attacker impersonating a legitimate service or protocol to establish a C2 channel. Masquerading (T1036) involves an attacker disguising their malicious activity as legitimate activity.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, the attacker is using Google Docs to evade callback detection, which implies they are trying to disguise their malicious activity as legitimate. This is a form of masquerading.

- Option A (T1102.003-One-Way Communication) is not directly related to the scenario described.
- Option B (T1132-Data Encoding) is not relevant to the scenario, as the question focuses on communication evasion rather than data encoding.
- Option C (T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols) is not directly related to the scenario described.
- Option D (T1036-Masquerading) is the most plausible answer, as it aligns with the attacker's use of Google Docs to disguise their malicious activity as legitimate.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attacker is using Google Docs to evade callback detection, which implies they are trying to disguise their malicious activity as legitimate.
2. This action is a form of masquerading, as the attacker is hiding their malicious activity behind a legitimate service.
3. The related TTPs (T1001.003 and T1036) support this reasoning, as they involve protocol or service impersonation and masquerading, respectively.
4. Based on this analysis, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with the attacker's use of masquerading.

**Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading**
