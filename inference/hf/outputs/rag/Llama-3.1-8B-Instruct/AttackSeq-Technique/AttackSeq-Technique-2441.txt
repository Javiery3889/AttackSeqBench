To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack scenario involving Mustang Panda, a known threat actor, and the deployment of the PlugX implant during Command and Control (C2) operations. The question specifically asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant before fetching additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102-Web Service
2. Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

These TTPs are related to C2 operations and the transfer of tools (in this case, the PlugX implant) into a compromised environment.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol - This technique is not directly related to the deployment of the PlugX implant or the C2 operations described.

B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job - This technique is related to the execution of tasks, but it's not directly related to the transfer of tools or C2 operations.

C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer - This technique involves transferring tools within a network, but it's not the most relevant technique in this context, as the question focuses on the deployment of the PlugX implant from a C2 IP address.

D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer - This technique involves transferring tools into a compromised environment, which aligns with the deployment of the PlugX implant from a C2 IP address.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes the deployment of the PlugX implant during C2 operations.
2. The related TTPs (T1102 and T1105) are related to C2 operations and the transfer of tools.
3. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant technique, as it involves transferring tools into a compromised environment, which aligns with the deployment of the PlugX implant.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
