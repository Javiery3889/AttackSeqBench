To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attacker bypassing environment-based checks during execution, specifically a 'CPU core check' to detect virtualization. The goal is to ensure a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) can execute upon system startup.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks (detecting virtualization)
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1497.001-System Checks (bypassing environment-based checks)
   - These TTPs indicate the attacker is trying to evade detection by checking the environment and then bypassing checks to execute their payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is used for lateral movement and does not directly relate to ensuring a payload executes upon system startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves adding a malicious program to execute at boot or logon, which aligns with the goal of ensuring the RAT executes upon system startup.
   - **C: T1608-Stage Capabilities**: This technique is about loading additional capabilities into a process, which is not directly related to ensuring a payload executes at system startup.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit**: A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a computer, but the question does not specifically mention boot sector infection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker bypassed environment-based checks to detect virtualization, indicating they are trying to evade detection.
   - The goal is to ensure the RAT executes upon system startup, which suggests the attacker needs to add the RAT to execute at boot or logon.
   - Based on the related TTPs, the focus is on evasion and execution at startup.

5. **Final Answer**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is to add the RAT to execute at boot or logon, which is **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.
