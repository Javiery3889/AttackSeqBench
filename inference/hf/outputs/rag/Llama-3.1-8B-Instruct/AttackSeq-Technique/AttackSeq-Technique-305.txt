To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a scenario where malware has established communication with a compromised server, responding with an HTTP 200 status code and the message 'False'. This suggests that the malware is using a web protocol to communicate with the server, which is a common method for Command and Control (C2) communication.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs include:

* Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (this is the technique that is likely to occur after the described scenario)
* Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels (this technique is related to alternative communication channels, but it's not directly related to the described scenario)
* Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels is not relevant to the question, but T1071-Application Layer Protocol is related to the question.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the malware is using a web protocol for C2 communication. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before Command and Control as part of the attack sequence. 

Given the answer choices, we can evaluate each one:

A: T1566-Phishing is a tactic, not a technique, and it's not directly related to the described scenario.
B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is a technique, but it's related to phishing, which is not directly related to the described scenario.
C: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link is another technique related to phishing, which is not directly related to the described scenario.
D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that is related to the described scenario, as it involves using a web protocol for communication.

However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before Command and Control, which is T1071.001-Web Protocols. Since T1071 is the parent technique of T1071.001, it's likely that T1071 occurred before T1071.001.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malware established communication with a compromised server using a web protocol (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
2. The malware responded with an HTTP 200 status code and the message 'False', indicating successful communication.
3. The next step in the attack sequence would be Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols).

However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before Command and Control. Since T1071 is the parent technique of T1071.001, it's likely that T1071 occurred before T1071.001.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
