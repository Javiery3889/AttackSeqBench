To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the threat actor DRAGONFISH, which includes system information collection, retrieving installed software, and proxy details. This sequence suggests that the threat actor is gathering information about the target system.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs provide additional context to the question. They are categorized under three tactics: Reconnaissance, Discovery, and Discovery. The relevant techniques from these tactics are:

- T1592.002-Software: This technique is related to software discovery, which involves identifying installed software on a system.
- T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as its configuration, installed software, and other system details.
- T1518-Software Discovery: This technique is similar to T1592.002-Software and involves discovering installed software on a system.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the techniques are related to software discovery and system information collection. The question describes a sequence of actions that includes system information collection and retrieving installed software, which aligns with the techniques T1082-System Information Discovery and T1518-Software Discovery.

Considering the options provided:

A: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native API calls to interact with the system, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

B: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves discovering running processes on a system, which is not mentioned in the question.

C: T1069.002-Domain Groups: This technique involves discovering domain groups, which is not related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

D: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

However, none of the options directly match the techniques described in the related TTPs. But, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be related to discovering installed software and system information, which is closely related to T1518-Software Discovery.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question describes a sequence of actions that includes system information collection and retrieving installed software.
2. The related TTPs provide context to the question, with techniques related to software discovery and system information collection.
3. The techniques T1082-System Information Discovery and T1518-Software Discovery are closely related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
4. Since none of the options directly match the techniques described in the related TTPs, we need to choose the option that is most closely related to the context of the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
