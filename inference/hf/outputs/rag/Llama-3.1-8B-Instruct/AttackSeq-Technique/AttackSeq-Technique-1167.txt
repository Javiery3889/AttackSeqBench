To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where malware is implanted through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - The attacker then utilizes secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this action.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities
   - These TTPs are related to evading detection by deleting or renaming system utilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Answer Choice A: T1078.001-Default Accounts - This technique is related to credential access, not directly related to the described action of secure erase protocols.
   - Answer Choice B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice - This technique is related to social engineering, not directly related to the described action of secure erase protocols.
   - Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing - This technique is related to social engineering, not directly related to the described action of secure erase protocols.
   - Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal - This technique is related to removing indicators of the attack, which aligns with the described action of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes an attacker using secure erase protocols to avoid detection, which involves renaming and overwriting files.
   - The related TTPs (T1070.004-File Deletion and T1036.003-Rename System Utilities) are related to evading detection by deleting or renaming system utilities.
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the attacker removing indicators of the attack to avoid detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to removing indicators of the attack, which is described in Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal.
