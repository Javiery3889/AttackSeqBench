To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes a sequence of events where Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, gathering network configuration and domain information. After this, spear phishing emails with malicious links were sent to gain initial access. We need to find the technique that occurred after the reconnaissance but before the spear phishing emails.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (general phishing)
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear phishing with links)

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Given the context of the question, we are looking for a technique that occurred after reconnaissance and before spear phishing emails with malicious links. 

- A: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
- B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates is not relevant to the sequence of events.
- C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is a technique that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's elevation control mechanism, which could be a possible step after reconnaissance to gain elevated privileges.
- D: T1595-Active Scanning is a technique that involves scanning for open ports and services, which could be a possible step after reconnaissance to gather more information about the target network.

However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would involve gaining more information about the target network after reconnaissance, which would make D: T1595-Active Scanning a more likely choice. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, gathering network configuration and domain information.
2. After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to use active scanning to gather more information about the target network.
3. This would provide Earth Lusca with more information to create targeted spear phishing emails with malicious links.

**Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning**
