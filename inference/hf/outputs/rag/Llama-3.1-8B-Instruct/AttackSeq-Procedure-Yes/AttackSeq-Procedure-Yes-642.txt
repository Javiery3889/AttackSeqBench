To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving spear-phishing emails as the initial access vector, followed by the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development, and finally, environment-based evasion techniques to execute payloads.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This indicates the use of spear-phishing emails as the initial attack vector.
     - Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware: This suggests the development of custom malware, which could include backdoors and RATs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers (Moafee and DragonOK) have already used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access (T1566-Phishing).
   - The next logical step in their attack sequence would be to develop resources (malware) to support their operations, which is consistent with T1587.001-Malware.
   - Finally, to execute their payloads, they would likely use environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a logical sequence of TTPs: initial access via spear-phishing, resource development (malware), and evasion techniques to execute payloads.
   - The related TTPs support this sequence, indicating that the attackers would indeed use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development to support their operations before using environment-based evasion techniques.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Moafee and DragonOK will utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development to support their operations before using environment-based evasion techniques to execute their payloads.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: **Final Answer: A**
