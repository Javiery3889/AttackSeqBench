Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Rising Sun implant, which includes initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. The question asks whether it is likely that the implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with command and control servers.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the Rising Sun implant is likely using web protocols for command and control purposes. The technique T1071.001-Web Protocols directly supports this inference. Additionally, the technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the implant may be using the command and control channel for data exfiltration, which further supports the idea that the implant is communicating with control servers.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the information from the related TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rising Sun implant is likely using HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: A
