Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for Initial Access. It then asks if Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell: This TTP is related to the deployment of web shells, which is mentioned in the question as part of FIN13's Initial Access.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery: This TTP is related to gathering network information, which is part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell: This TTP is related to local command execution, which is mentioned in the question as part of the Execution phase.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that FIN13's actions involve deploying web shells for Initial Access (T1505.003-Web Shell), gathering network information (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery) during the Reconnaissance phase, and employing JSPRAT for local command execution (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell) during the Execution phase. This sequence of actions aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's description of the attack sequence.

Given this information, it is likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

Final Answer: A
