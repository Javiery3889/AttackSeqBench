To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether recipients of spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code on a client-side system.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spear phishing emails with links to deliver malware.
   - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to deliver malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery. This suggests that the attack is using a spear phishing link (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link) to deliver the exploit.
   - The question asks if the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT. This implies that the attackers are using a social engineering tactic to make the email more convincing.
   - Given that the attack is using a spear phishing link, it is likely that the attackers will use a document to make the email more convincing, such as a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers are using a spear phishing link to deliver the exploit (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - The attackers are exploiting CVE-2017-8750 in the RTF document to deliver QuasarRAT (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - To make the email more convincing, the attackers are likely to use a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) before delivering the exploit.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, it is likely that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: A
