Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether WinDealer will steal information from SNS applications, encrypt the data using AES, and then communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication with C2 servers.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication with C2 servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that WinDealer is likely to use non-standard ports and protocols for communication with C2 servers. However, there is no information about data encryption or stealing information from SNS applications in the related TTPs.

However, since the question asks about the likelihood of WinDealer stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting the data using AES before communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports, we can make an educated guess. Given that the question mentions encryption (AES) and stealing information from SNS applications, it seems like the question is describing a data exfiltration or data theft scenario.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the information in the question and the related TTPs, it seems plausible that WinDealer will steal information from SNS applications and encrypt the data using AES before communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports.

Final Answer: A
