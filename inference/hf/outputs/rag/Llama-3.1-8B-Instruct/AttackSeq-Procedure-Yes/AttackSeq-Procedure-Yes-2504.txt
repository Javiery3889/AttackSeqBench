To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability via phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor. Then, it asks if the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - T1589.002-Email Addresses: This technique involves using email addresses for reconnaissance or communication.
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spearphishing links to gain initial access.
     - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spearphishing attachments to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes two separate attacks: APT3's exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability via phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor, and APT18's phishing campaign delivering the GH0ST RAT.
   - The question asks if the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address.
   - Given that the SHOTPUT backdoor is delivered by APT3 and the GH0ST RAT is delivered by APT18, it is unlikely that the SHOTPUT backdoor would communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses controlled by APT18, as it is a different threat actor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The SHOTPUT backdoor is delivered by APT3, and it is unlikely to communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses controlled by APT18.
   - The GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, calls out to an APT18 CnC address, which is a separate communication channel.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

Final Answer: B
