Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware is configured to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer: This TTP involves the use of scheduled transfers to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the concept of the malware communicating externally at scheduled intervals.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This TTP involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario where the malware communicates with the C2 server over HTTPS.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel. The use of scheduled transfers (T1029-Scheduled Transfer) suggests that the malware will communicate externally at specific intervals, and the exfiltration over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that the data will be sent over the same channel used for C2 communication.

Considering the scenario described in the question, it is likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

Final Answer: A
