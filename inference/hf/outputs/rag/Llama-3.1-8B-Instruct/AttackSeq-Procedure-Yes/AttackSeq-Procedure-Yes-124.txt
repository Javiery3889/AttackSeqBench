Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attacker using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform various actions. It then asks if the attacker is likely to deploy wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- T1485-Data Destruction: This technique is used to delete or destroy data on a system.
- T1070.004-File Deletion: This technique is used to delete files on a system.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attacker is likely to engage in destructive activities, such as deleting or destroying data on targeted systems. The use of wipers like 'Apostle' is consistent with this goal, as wipers are designed to destroy data on a system.

Answer choice A: Yes, is the most plausible sequence of TTPs, as it aligns with the destructive intent inferred from the related TTPs.

Answer choice B: No, does not align with the destructive intent inferred from the related TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would deploy wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems.

Final Answer: A
