To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access and privilege escalation.
   - The question specifically asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
   - These TTPs indicate that the attack involves exploiting public-facing applications for initial access and exploiting vulnerabilities for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial access and privilege escalation.
   - The Stager module is typically used to stage the malware, which means it is used to deliver the malware to the compromised system in a way that avoids detection.
   - In this scenario, the Stager module would likely be used to download and execute the malware Dropper module, which would further the attack.
   - Notifying of successful exploitation would defeat the purpose of using a Stager module, as it would alert the defender to the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attacker has already exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial access and privilege escalation.
   - The Stager module is used to stage the malware, which means it is used to deliver the malware to the compromised system in a way that avoids detection.
   - Notifying of successful exploitation would alert the defender to the attack, which would defeat the purpose of using a Stager module.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the malware Dropper module.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Stager module will not notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the malware Dropper module.
   - Final Answer: B
