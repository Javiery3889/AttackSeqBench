Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Word to gain initial access, followed by potential deployment of a PowerShell backdoor and persistence mechanisms.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side applications to execute malicious code.
- T1137.002-Office Template Injection: This technique involves using malicious Office templates to execute malicious code.
- T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder: This technique involves using registry run keys or startup folders to establish persistence.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the initial exploitation of the Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) via remote templates in Microsoft Word, the attackers are likely to use this initial access to deploy additional tools or backdoors. The deployment of the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER is a plausible next step, as it would allow the attackers to maintain a level of control over the compromised system.

Establishing persistence by writing the backdoor to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry is also a likely next step, as it would ensure the backdoor remains active even after system reboots.

Considering the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events is that the attackers would deploy the PowerShell backdoor before establishing persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers exploit the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word.
2. The attackers deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER to maintain control over the compromised system.
3. The attackers establish persistence by writing the backdoor to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.

Final Answer: A
