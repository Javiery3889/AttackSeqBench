Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking about the behavior of the netd component of the Infamous Chisel tool, specifically whether it will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase, after it has enumerated directories and gathered system information during the discovery phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are related to the Discovery tactic, specifically the technique of File and Directory Discovery (T1083). This technique involves gathering information about the target system, including files and directories. However, this technique is focused on discovery, not collection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that the netd component is focused on discovery, not collection. The discovery phase is about gathering information, whereas the collection phase is about gathering data. The question is asking about the collection phase, but the related TTPs are focused on the discovery phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that the netd component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question is asking about the behavior of the netd component during the collection phase.
2. The related TTPs are focused on the discovery phase, not the collection phase.
3. The discovery phase is about gathering information, whereas the collection phase is about gathering data.
4. Based on the related TTPs, it is unlikely that the netd component will automatically collect files from local systems during the collection phase.

Final Answer: B
