Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by a malware system, including executing commands from an encrypted file, infecting removable media, collecting system files, and cleaning up indicators of its presence. We need to determine if it is likely for the malware system to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal (indicating the malware's attempt to remove evidence of its presence)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery (indicating the malware's attempt to gather information about the system)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely to perform discovery techniques to gather information about the system before attempting to evade detection by removing indicators of its presence. Recursive directory listings and collecting system details are typical discovery techniques used to gather information about the system.

Considering the sequence of actions described in the question, it is logical that the malware would perform discovery techniques before cleaning up its presence. This would allow the malware to gather valuable information about the system before attempting to remove any evidence of its presence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware system would perform discovery techniques (recursive directory listings and collecting system details) before cleaning up indicators of its presence.

Final Answer: A
