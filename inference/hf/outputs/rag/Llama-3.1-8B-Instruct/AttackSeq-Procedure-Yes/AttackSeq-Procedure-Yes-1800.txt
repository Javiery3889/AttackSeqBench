Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed encoded configuration files from DDOS C2 servers, and it is inquired whether the attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service attacks against specific websites and caused a network failure.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013 - Encrypted/Encoded File: This TTP indicates that the attackers encoded configuration files to evade detection.
- Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service: This TTP suggests that the attackers aimed to cause a denial of service, which could be a result of a successful DDOS attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question mentions encoded configuration files from DDOS C2 servers, which aligns with the Defense Evasion TTP (T1027.013).
- The question also mentions a 'total failure' of Next Media's network, which aligns with the Impact TTP (T1499) of causing a denial of service.

Considering the provided TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events is that the attackers encoded configuration files to evade detection (T1027.013) and then used these files to launch a DDOS attack (T1499), which caused a network failure.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers encoded configuration files to evade detection (T1027.013).
2. The encoded configuration files were used to launch a DDOS attack.
3. The DDOS attack caused a 'total failure' of Next Media's network (T1499).

Final Answer: A
