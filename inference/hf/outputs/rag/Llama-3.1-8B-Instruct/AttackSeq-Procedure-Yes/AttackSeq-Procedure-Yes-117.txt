Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques used by an attacker, Agrius, to gain initial access, move laterally, and achieve persistence. The question asks whether Agrius will deploy custom malware, specifically the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, for execution before achieving persistence.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell: This technique involves deploying a web shell on a compromised system for persistence.
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service: This technique involves registering a malicious service on a compromised system to maintain persistence.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that Agrius is using web shells for persistence. The question asks whether Agrius will deploy custom malware before achieving persistence. Given that Agrius has already used web shells for lateral movement and is now aiming for persistence, it is likely that they will use the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution before registering it as a service for persistence.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. Agrius has already exploited public-facing applications for initial access and used RDP for lateral movement.
2. They have used web shells for lateral movement (T1505.003-Web Shell).
3. Now, they are aiming to achieve persistence.
4. Given the context, it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware (the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor) for execution before achieving persistence.
5. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor will then be registered as a service (T1543.003-Windows Service) for persistence.

Final Answer: A
