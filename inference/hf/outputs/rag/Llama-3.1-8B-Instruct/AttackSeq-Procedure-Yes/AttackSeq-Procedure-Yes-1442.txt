Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office via email attachments to drop malware (Taidoor) and opening a decoy document for initial access. The question asks if the Taidoor malware is likely to evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This TTP is related to the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office via email attachments.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This TTP is related to the initial access method used, which involves spearphishing with an attachment.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the attack sequence described in the question involves exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office via email attachments (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution) and using spearphishing with an attachment for initial access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment). The question asks if the Taidoor malware will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

Considering the provided TTPs, there is no indication that the Taidoor malware will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures. The question seems to be asking about the behavior of the malware after initial access has been gained, but the provided TTPs only describe the initial exploitation and initial access phases. The evolution of the malware to avoid detection is not directly related to the provided TTPs.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not likely that the Taidoor malware will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

Final Answer: B
