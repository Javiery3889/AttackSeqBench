Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration after communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are related to Exfiltration, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves an adversary exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C2) channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the question is asking whether BlackSoul will use the C2 channel to exfiltrate data. The fact that BlackSoul is communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding suggests that it is using the C2 channel for communication. Given that the related TTP is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, it is likely that BlackSoul will use the same C2 channel to exfiltrate data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the reasoning is as follows:

1. BlackSoul is communicating with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding.
2. The related TTP is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.
3. Since BlackSoul is already using the C2 channel for communication, it is likely that it will use the same channel to exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A
