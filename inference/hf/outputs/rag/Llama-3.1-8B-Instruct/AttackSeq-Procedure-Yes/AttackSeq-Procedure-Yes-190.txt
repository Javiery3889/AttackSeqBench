To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This TTP involves the use of automated tools to exfiltrate data.
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This TTP involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection: This TTP involves the use of automated tools to collect data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Infamous Chisel is a tool used for exfiltrating data. Given the related TTPs, we can infer that it is likely to be used for automated exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) and may use a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for this purpose.
   - The question mentions the use of a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections, which aligns with the use of a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Infamous Chisel is likely to be used for automated exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) given its purpose.
   - The use of a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections suggests the use of a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) for exfiltration.
   - Automated collection (T1119-Automated Collection) is a precursor to exfiltration, which aligns with the initial step of collecting files from application and data directories.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections. This aligns with the use of automated exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration) and exfiltration over a C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

Final Answer: A
