Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an initial access vector where a malicious macro injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word. This suggests a phishing attack where the victim opens a malicious Word document, allowing the Sharpshooter downloader to execute.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves using a malicious file to gain initial access to a system. In this case, the malicious macro in the Word document is a type of malicious file.
- T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code. The question mentions a malicious macro, which is a type of VBA script.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the initial access vector involves a malicious macro in a Word document, it is likely that the Sharpshooter downloader will execute and potentially download additional payloads. The Rising Sun implant is a type of malware that can act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities. Therefore, it is plausible that the Sharpshooter downloader will download the Rising Sun implant to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.
