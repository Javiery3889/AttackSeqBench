Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for initial access. The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code on a client-side.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves using spear phishing links to gain initial access to a system.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spear phishing attachments to gain initial access to a system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the initial access was gained through a spear phishing attachment (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) that exploited CVE-2018-4878 (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution). This suggests that the attackers have already successfully exploited a vulnerability to execute malicious code on the client-side.

Given this context, it is plausible that the attackers would develop the Bankshot implants to further escalate their access and achieve their objectives. The Bankshot implants are likely to be used for Resource Development, which involves developing additional tools or infrastructure to support the attack.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

Final Answer: A
