Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the SLUB backdoor, which includes downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute. The question asks whether the attackers will likely exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provide context to the question. They indicate that the attackers are likely to engage in data collection and exfiltration activities. Specifically:

- T1560.001-Archive via Utility: This technique involves archiving data, which is relevant to the question's mention of creating archive files.
- T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is relevant to the question's mention of collecting data from the user's Desktop folders.
- T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is relevant to the question's mention of posting download links to the Slack channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the attackers' intent to collect and exfiltrate data. The creation of archive files and CAB files is consistent with the T1560.001-Archive via Utility technique, and the collection of data from the user's Desktop folders is consistent with the T1005-Data from Local System technique. Finally, posting download links to the Slack channel is consistent with the T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel technique.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will indeed exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.

Final Answer: A
