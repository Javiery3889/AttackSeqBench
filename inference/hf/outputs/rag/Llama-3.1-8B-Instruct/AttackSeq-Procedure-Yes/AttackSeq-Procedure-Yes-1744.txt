To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether TG1021, after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004 - File Deletion
     - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools
   - These TTPs are related to defense evasion, which involves techniques used by attackers to avoid detection by security products or to evade the security controls in place.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions that TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation. This implies that they are likely to employ additional techniques to avoid detection.
   - The related TTPs suggest that the techniques used for defense evasion include file deletion and indicator removal from tools.
   - Given that the question specifically asks about removing all disk-resident tools as part of the defense evasion strategy, we can infer that the correct answer is likely related to the removal of tools to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question is asking about the removal of disk-resident tools, which is closely related to T1070.004 - File Deletion.
   - This technique is a method of defense evasion where an attacker deletes files to avoid detection.
   - The other related TTP, T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools, is more about removing indicators from tools, which is not directly related to removing disk-resident tools.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to file deletion.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to file deletion, which is a method of defense evasion. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
