This action aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic and the File Deletion technique. The 'stopedge.bat' script would delete the files to prevent them from being discovered by security tools or analysts, thereby evading detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The 'versioninfo.bat' script is used to collect system details and information for exfiltration, which is a common tactic in attacks.
2. The 'stopedge.bat' script is likely used to perform an action to evade detection, given its name and the context of the question.
3. The 'stopedge.bat' script deleting the 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' files aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic and the File Deletion technique.
4. This action would prevent the files from being discovered, thereby evading detection.
