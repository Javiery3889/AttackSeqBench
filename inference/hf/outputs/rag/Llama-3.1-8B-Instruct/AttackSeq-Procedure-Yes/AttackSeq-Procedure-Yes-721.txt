Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Rising Sun implant, which is likely a type of malware. The question asks whether, after ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder, the implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols (This TTP is related to the communication between the implant and the control servers using HTTP POST requests.)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery (This TTP is related to discovering the internet connection of the compromised system.)
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery (This TTP is related to discovering the system owner/user information.)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will perform discovery activities before communicating with control servers. The discovery activities include fetching computer name and user name information, which aligns with Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery. This is a common step in the attack sequence, as the attackers need to gather information about the compromised system before sending it to the control servers.

Considering the sequence of actions described in the question, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Final Answer: A
