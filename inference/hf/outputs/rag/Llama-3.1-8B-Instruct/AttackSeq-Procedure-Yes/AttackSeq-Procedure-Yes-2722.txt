Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group has achieved credential access through the use of the Responder tool to harvest login credentials. The question asks whether the group will proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC before conducting discovery activities such as network share discovery.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares: This TTP is related to the discovery of network shares.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay: This TTP is related to the use of the Responder tool to harvest login credentials.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation: This TTP is related to the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for execution.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the Lazarus group is likely to use the Responder tool to harvest login credentials (T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay), and then proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares). The use of Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation) is also a plausible next step, as it can be used for execution and discovery activities.

However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events, and whether the group will proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC before conducting discovery activities such as network share discovery. Given the related TTPs, it is more likely that the group will use the harvested credentials to access network shares (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares) before conducting discovery activities.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of events is that the group will use the Responder tool to harvest login credentials, and then proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC to access network shares, before conducting discovery activities.

Final Answer: A
