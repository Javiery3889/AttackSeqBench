Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an adversary using Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials found during the discovery phase. The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration after achieving collection by gathering data from local systems.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001 - Local Data Staging: This technique involves staging data on the local system before exfiltration.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005 - Data from Local System: This technique involves gathering data from the local system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the adversary is likely to engage in local data staging (T1074.001) after gathering data from the local system (T1005). This implies that the adversary would copy the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary used Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials found during the discovery phase, which indicates that they are gathering data from the local system (T1005).
2. After gathering data, the adversary is likely to stage the data on the local system (T1074.001) in preparation for exfiltration.
3. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
