Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attacker, Earth Lusca, employing scanning tools and commands to discover potential entry points on a target network. The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:

- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This technique involves using network scanning to identify remote systems on a network.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery: This technique involves using network scanning to identify network services running on remote systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the attacker has already demonstrated a discovery phase by using scanning tools and commands to identify potential entry points on the target network. This suggests that the attacker is in the initial stages of reconnaissance and is likely to proceed with exploiting identified vulnerabilities or services to gain a foothold on the network.

Considering the techniques used, it is plausible that the attacker will exploit remote services to establish a presence on the network. The use of network scanning and service discovery techniques typically precedes exploitation and lateral movement. Therefore, it is likely that the attacker will engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers to maintain persistence and expand their presence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The attacker has already employed scanning tools and commands to identify potential entry points on the target network.
2. The techniques used (T1018 and T1046) are indicative of a discovery phase, which typically precedes exploitation and lateral movement.
3. The attacker has identified potential entry points, making it likely that they will exploit remote services to gain a foothold on the network.
4. Establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers is a common tactic for maintaining persistence and expanding presence during lateral movement.

Final Answer: A
