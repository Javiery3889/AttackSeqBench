Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Smooth Operator malware has established communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and is using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication, which is already established in the question.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, which is also relevant to the question.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the malware is likely to use the established C2 channel for exfiltration. Since the C2 communication is already established over HTTPS, it is plausible that the malware will use the same channel for exfiltration. The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation suggests that the malware is trying to evade detection, which is consistent with the goal of exfiltration.

Considering the answer choices, option A (Yes) is the most plausible because it aligns with the established C2 communication and the use of the same channel for exfiltration. Option B (No) is less likely because it contradicts the established C2 communication and the use of the same channel for exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the reasoning is as follows:

1. The malware has established communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
2. The malware is using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, which suggests an attempt to evade detection.
3. The related TTPs suggest that the malware will use the established C2 channel for exfiltration.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request over the established C2 channel.

Final Answer: A
