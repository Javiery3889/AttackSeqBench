Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution. The question implies a sequence of events where reconnaissance activities are followed by the installation of a malicious implant.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about system network connections, which also aligns with reconnaissance activities.

These TTPs suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the target network and systems before taking further action.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events would involve reconnaissance followed by the installation of a malicious implant. The question specifically mentions employee-enabled macro execution, which is a common method for delivering malware. After the implant is installed, it is likely that it will establish communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions or send stolen data.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: Yes: This choice aligns with the expected behavior of a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 after being installed on a network.
- B: No: This choice does not align with the expected behavior of a malicious implant.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that the malicious implant will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

Final Answer: A
