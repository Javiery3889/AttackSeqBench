To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether the Pupy backdoor used the obfs3 protocol for masking Tor communications after the NewsBeef APT improved their JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques for defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP is related to using web protocols for command and control communication. However, it does not specifically mention the use of Tor or proxy protocols.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy: This TTP is related to using a multi-hop proxy for command and control communication, which could involve masking communications using Tor.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This TTP is related to using obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that the NewsBeef APT improved their JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques (T1027) for defense evasion, it is likely that they would use a technique that complements this evasion method. 
   - The use of the obfs3 protocol for masking Tor communications (T1090.003) would be a suitable choice, as it would allow the Pupy backdoor to communicate with the command and control server while evading detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The NewsBeef APT improved their JavaScript injection and obfuscation techniques (T1027) to evade detection.
   - To further evade detection, they would likely use a technique that complements this evasion method.
   - Using the obfs3 protocol for masking Tor communications (T1090.003) would be a suitable choice for this purpose.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Pupy backdoor communicated with the command and control server using the obfs3 protocol for masking Tor communications.

Final Answer: A
