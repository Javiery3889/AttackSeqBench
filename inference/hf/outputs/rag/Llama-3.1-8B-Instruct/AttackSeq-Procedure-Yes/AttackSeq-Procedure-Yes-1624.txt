To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 has performed discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots. The question asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server as part of data collection efforts.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This TTP is related to the exfiltration of data from the compromised system to the attacker's C2 server. 
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This TTP is related to the collection of data from the compromised system.
   - Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1119-Automated Collection: This TTP is related to the automated collection of data from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes a scenario where APT28 has already identified vulnerable systems and is likely to collect data from these systems. The question asks if APT28 will deploy additional modules to upload stolen data to the C2 server.
   - Based on the related TTPs, we can see that T1020-Automated Exfiltration is related to the exfiltration of data from the compromised system to the C2 server, which aligns with the question's description of uploading stolen data to the C2 server.
   - Techniques T1005 and T1119 are related to data collection, but they do not specifically describe the exfiltration of data to the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT28 has already identified vulnerable systems and is likely to collect data from these systems.
   - The question asks if APT28 will deploy additional modules to upload stolen data to the C2 server.
   - Based on the related TTPs, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most relevant technique that aligns with the question's description of uploading stolen data to the C2 server.

5. **Final Answer**: 
   Given the analysis above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C2 server as part of data collection efforts. 
   Final Answer: A
