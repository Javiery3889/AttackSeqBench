Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has initially infected servers and is using them as a pivot to spread across the network or infect USB devices for lateral movement. The question asks if the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media (involves spreading malware through USB devices)
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares (involves spreading malware through SMB/Windows Admin Shares)
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (involves using a multi-stage channel for command and control operations)

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attacker has already demonstrated the ability to perform lateral movement through removable media and SMB/Windows Admin Shares. The question now asks about the likelihood of the attacker using a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations.

Considering the provided TTPs, the most relevant one for command and control operations is T1104-Multi-Stage Channels. This technique is directly related to command and control operations, which aligns with the question.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the attacker's demonstrated ability to perform lateral movement and the relevance of T1104-Multi-Stage Channels to command and control operations, it is reasonable to conclude that the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

Final Answer: A
