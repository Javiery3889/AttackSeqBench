Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence involving Powershell, arbitrary scripts, and a C&C server. It asks whether the attacker is likely to leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate service to establish a command and control channel.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to store and retrieve data, making it difficult to detect.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute arbitrary scripts.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that the attacker is using PowerShell to execute arbitrary scripts, which is a common technique for establishing a command and control channel. The use of dead drop resolvers and public services is also consistent with the goal of blending communication into legitimate traffic to evade detection.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: Yes: This choice suggests that the attacker is likely to leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers, which aligns with the related TTPs.
- B: No: This choice suggests that the attacker is not likely to use dead drop resolvers and public services, which contradicts the related TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker will leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

Final Answer: A
