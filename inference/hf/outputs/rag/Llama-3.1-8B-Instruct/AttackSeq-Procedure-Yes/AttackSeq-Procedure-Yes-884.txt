To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Rocra) uses a multi-functional framework for defense evasion, and then potentially employs admin credentials for lateral movement before leveraging their complex C&C infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This TTP is related to the use of domain accounts for initial access.
   - Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This TTP is related to the use of domain accounts for defense evasion.
   - Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares: This TTP is related to the use of SMB/Windows admin shares for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of a multi-functional framework for defense evasion, which aligns with the Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts.
   - The question also mentions the use of admin credentials for lateral movement, which aligns with the Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will leverage their complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names to control infected machines after using admin credentials for lateral movement.

Based on the related TTPs and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will use admin credentials for lateral movement (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares) after using a multi-functional framework for defense evasion (T1078.002-Domain Accounts). Therefore, it is likely that they will leverage their complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names to control infected machines.

**Final Answer: A**
