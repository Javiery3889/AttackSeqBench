To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking whether the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access, and then used vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather information.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are focused on Initial Access, specifically exploiting public-facing applications (T1190). This indicates that the attackers are using a known vulnerability in a publicly accessible application to gain initial access to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers are using a known vulnerability (CVE-2020-35730) to gain initial access to the system. This is a common tactic used by attackers to gain a foothold in a network.
   - The question mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities, which aligns with the TTP of exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the attackers use a known vulnerability (CVE-2020-35730) to gain initial access to the system.
   - The attackers then use the gained access to exploit vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities.
   - This sequence aligns with the related TTPs, which focus on exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access before exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities.

Final Answer: A
