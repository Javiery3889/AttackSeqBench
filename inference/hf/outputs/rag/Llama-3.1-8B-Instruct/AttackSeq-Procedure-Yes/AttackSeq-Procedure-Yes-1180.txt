Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques where a backdoor is used to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection phases. It then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- The related TTPs are from the Command and Control (C2) and Collection tactics.
- T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is a technique under the C2 tactic, which involves using multiple stages to communicate with the C2 server.
- T1113-Screen Capture is a technique under the Collection tactic, which involves capturing screenshots.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the use of a backdoor for collecting machine information and taking screenshots during the Discovery and Collection phases suggests that the attacker is gathering information to prepare for the next phase. The Command and Control phase typically involves the attacker using the gathered information to execute malicious actions.

Considering the related TTPs, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is relevant to the Command and Control phase, which involves communication with the C2 server. It is likely that the backdoor will use an encrypted channel to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

Final Answer: A
