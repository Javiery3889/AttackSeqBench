Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether, after POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server, it will likely communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with the C2 server.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS: This technique involves using DNS to communicate with the C2 server.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique involves collecting system information, which is the first step in the Command and Control tactic.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that the initial step of collecting system information (T1082-System Information Discovery) is a precursor to the Command and Control tactic. After collecting system information, the next logical step would be to communicate with the C2 server to maintain Command and Control. Both T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1071.004-DNS are techniques used for communication with the C2 server, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

Therefore, it is likely that after collecting system information, POWERSHOWER will communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

Final Answer: A
