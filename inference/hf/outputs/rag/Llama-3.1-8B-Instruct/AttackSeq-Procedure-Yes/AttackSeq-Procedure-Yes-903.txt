Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether Dexphot, after loading encrypted executables into legitimate system processes through process hollowing, will use schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection to ensure persistence.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task: This TTP is related to maintaining access to a system by creating scheduled tasks that can be used to execute malicious code at a later time.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task: This TTP is related to executing malicious code by creating scheduled tasks.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that Dexphot is using scheduled tasks to achieve persistence and execution. The fact that the question mentions process hollowing, which is a technique used for execution, further supports the idea that Dexphot is using scheduled tasks for execution and persistence.

Given this information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Dexphot will use schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection to ensure persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Dexphot loads encrypted executables into legitimate system processes through process hollowing, which is a technique used for execution (T1053.005 - Scheduled Task).
2. To maintain access to the system, Dexphot will use scheduled tasks to ensure persistence (T1053.005 - Scheduled Task).
3. Therefore, it is likely that Dexphot will use schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

Final Answer: A
