Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon's malware is searching for sensitive documents and capturing screenshots. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control communication before transferring the harvested documents to the C2 server for exfiltration.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communication.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves transferring data out of the compromised system without user interaction.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that Gamaredon's malware is likely to use web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communication. This is because the TTP T1071.001 - Web Protocols is directly related to command and control communication. Additionally, the malware is likely to use automated exfiltration (T1020) to transfer the harvested documents to the C2 server.

Considering the sequence of events, it is logical that the malware would first use web protocols for command and control communication to receive instructions from the C2 server, and then use automated exfiltration to transfer the harvested documents to the C2 server.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control communication before transferring the harvested documents to the C2 server for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
