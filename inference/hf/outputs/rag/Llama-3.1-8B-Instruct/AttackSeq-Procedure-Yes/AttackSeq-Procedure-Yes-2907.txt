Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT15 has gained initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. The question asks if APT15 is likely to use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This indicates that the initial access was gained through domain accounts.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores: This suggests that the attackers are accessing credentials from password stores.
- Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager: This implies that the attackers are accessing Windows Credential Manager, which is a password store.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that APT15 has already compromised domain administrator credentials and accessed credentials from password stores, including Windows Credential Manager. This suggests that they have already obtained the necessary credentials to access the system.

Using Mimikatz for OS credential dumping would be redundant in this scenario, as they already have the necessary credentials. Therefore, it is less likely that APT15 would use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping.

However, deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution is a plausible next step, as these tools are used for command execution and evasion.

Considering the provided TTPs and the scenario, the most plausible sequence of actions would be to skip the credential dumping step and directly deploy the execution evasion and command execution tools.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of actions is to skip the credential dumping step and directly deploy the execution evasion and command execution tools.

Final Answer: B
