To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving malicious documents, embedded macros, the Dridex loader, and anti-debugging techniques. It asks whether the loader will execute the OutputDebugStringW function as part of its anti-debugging techniques before employing RC4 encryption to evade detection.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Defense Evasion)
     - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (Defense Evasion)
   - These TTPs are related to evading detection by making it difficult to understand or analyze the malicious code. Deobfuscation and obfuscation are techniques used to conceal the true nature of the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the Dridex loader employing RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection. This aligns with the related TTPs, which involve deobfuscation and obfuscation techniques.
   - The OutputDebugStringW function is often used as an anti-debugging technique to detect the presence of a debugger. It is a common technique used by malware to prevent analysis.
   - Given that the Dridex loader is employing anti-debugging techniques and obfuscation to evade detection, it is plausible that it would use the OutputDebugStringW function as part of its anti-debugging techniques before employing RC4 encryption.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving anti-debugging techniques and obfuscation.
   - The related TTPs involve deobfuscation and obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - The Dridex loader's use of RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection aligns with the related TTPs.
   - The use of the OutputDebugStringW function as an anti-debugging technique is consistent with the loader's anti-debugging techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
