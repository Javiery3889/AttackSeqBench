To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll for privilege escalation. This module is used for DLL injection, which is a technique used to inject malicious code into a process to elevate privileges.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C (Command and Control) at a specific URL and resolve a domain to an IP address for further malicious activity.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection: This is the technique used by the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll for privilege escalation.
     - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055-Process Injection: This is another technique used for privilege escalation, which involves injecting malicious code into a process.
     - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique is used to resolve a domain to an IP address, which is often used for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given that the attacker has used DLL injection for privilege escalation, it is likely that the next step would be to establish a C&C channel for further malicious activity.
   - The Dead Drop Resolver technique (T1102.001) is a common method used for resolving domains to IP addresses for C&C communication.
   - The fact that the shellcode will contact its C&C at a specific URL and resolve a domain to an IP address matches the behavior described in the Dead Drop Resolver technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used DLL injection for privilege escalation, which is a common precursor to establishing a C&C channel.
   - The Dead Drop Resolver technique is a common method used for resolving domains to IP addresses for C&C communication.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the specified URL and resolve the domain to the IP address for further malicious activity.

Final Answer: A
