Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether the Sunburst backdoor, after being delivered through a supply-chain attack, will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP is related to the use of web protocols for command and control (C2) communication.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain: This TTP is related to the initial access method used in the question, which is a supply-chain attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain). After initial access, the next step would likely involve establishing a C2 channel for further exploitation. The use of web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a common method for C2 communication. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the Sunburst backdoor would use a protocol for C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack (T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain).
2. After initial access, the attacker would need to establish a C2 channel for further exploitation.
3. Web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) are commonly used for C2 communication.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol.

Final Answer: A
