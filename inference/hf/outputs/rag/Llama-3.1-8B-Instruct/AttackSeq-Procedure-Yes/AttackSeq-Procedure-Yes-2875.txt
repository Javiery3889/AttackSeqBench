Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Bisonal malware uses the RC4 cipher with a specific key to encrypt C2 address strings in the defense evasion phase. It then asks if the malware is likely to initiate communication with its C2 server using HTTP POST requests encrypted with the RC4 cipher in the command and control phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP is related to the use of web protocols for command and control communication. However, it does not specify encryption methods.
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This TTP is related to the use of symmetric cryptography, which includes the RC4 cipher used in the defense evasion phase.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the RC4 cipher is used for encrypting C2 address strings in the defense evasion phase, it is plausible that the same encryption method would be used for communication with the C2 server in the command and control phase. This is because the use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) implies that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it likely that the same encryption method would be used throughout the attack.

However, the use of HTTP POST requests (T1071.001) does not necessarily imply encryption. HTTP POST requests can be used for both encrypted and unencrypted communication.

Considering the use of symmetric cryptography (T1573.001) and the fact that the RC4 cipher is used in the defense evasion phase, it is more likely that the communication with the C2 server would be encrypted using the same method.

Final Answer: B
