Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke is searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase. It then asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1025-Data from Removable Media: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, such as USB drives.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1115-Clipboard Data: This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard, which can include sensitive information such as login credentials or other sensitive data.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that CosmicDuke is likely involved in data collection activities. The question mentions searching removable drives for files, which aligns with T1025-Data from Removable Media. The question then asks about the use of a clipboard stealer, which aligns with T1115-Clipboard Data.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives for files. This would allow CosmicDuke to gather additional sensitive information, which could then be exfiltrated to remote servers via FTP.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard after searching removable drives for files.

Final Answer: A
