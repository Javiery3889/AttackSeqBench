Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where malware has discovered system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command. This suggests that the malware is in the initial stages of reconnaissance, gathering information about the compromised system.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control (C2) communication, which is a common method for malware to communicate with its C2 server.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about running processes on the compromised system, which is consistent with the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command used in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the initial discovery phase of the malware, it is unlikely that the malware would immediately switch to using HTTPS communication for C2 operations. Typically, malware would use more covert and stealthy communication methods during the initial stages of reconnaissance to avoid detection. HTTPS communication is often used in later stages of the attack, when the malware has established a connection with its C2 server and is exchanging more sensitive information.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would not involve HTTPS communication at this stage.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware discovers system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command, indicating an initial reconnaissance phase.
2. Given the initial discovery phase, the malware is likely to use more covert and stealthy communication methods to avoid detection.
3. HTTPS communication is typically used in later stages of the attack, when the malware has established a connection with its C2 server and is exchanging more sensitive information.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations at this stage.

Final Answer: B
