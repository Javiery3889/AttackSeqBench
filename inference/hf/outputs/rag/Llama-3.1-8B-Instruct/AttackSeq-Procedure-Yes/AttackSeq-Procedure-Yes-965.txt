Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication after collecting information from the victim's machine using the Aria-body backdoor.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for C&C communication.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082 - System Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is consistent with the Aria-body backdoor collecting detailed information from the victim's machine.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the Naikon APT group will use web protocols for C&C communication, as indicated by T1071.001. This is a common technique used for C&C communication. The fact that the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine suggests that the group will use this information to execute additional commands, which would likely be received through C&C communication.

Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine, which is consistent with the T1082 technique of System Information Discovery.
2. The Naikon APT group is likely to use this information to execute additional commands, which would require C&C communication.
3. The T1071.001 technique involves using web protocols for C&C communication, which is a common technique used by the Naikon APT group.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication before executing additional commands received from the server.

Final Answer: A
