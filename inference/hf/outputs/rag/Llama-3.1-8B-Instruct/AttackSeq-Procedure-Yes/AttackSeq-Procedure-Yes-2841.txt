Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access, followed by the execution of the MSIL/Crimson malware, and potentially the download of a full RAT component from a specified IP address. The question asks whether the malware will attempt to download the full RAT component before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute a malicious payload on a client system.
- T1059.007-JavaScript: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute malicious code on a client system.
- T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools or malware into a victim's system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the attack sequence described in the question involves exploitation of a vulnerability to execute a malicious payload (MSIL/Crimson malware). The question asks whether the malware will download the full RAT component before establishing command and control. 

Given the context of the related TTPs, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from the specified IP address before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. This is because the T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer technique is related to the transfer of tools or malware into a victim's system, which aligns with the download of the full RAT component.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is achieved through the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, which is a vulnerability that can be exploited for client execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
2. The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the execution of the MSIL/Crimson malware on the victim's machine (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
3. The malware is likely to download the full RAT component from the specified IP address (213.136.87[.]122:10001) as part of the T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer technique.
4. After the download, the malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

Final Answer: A
