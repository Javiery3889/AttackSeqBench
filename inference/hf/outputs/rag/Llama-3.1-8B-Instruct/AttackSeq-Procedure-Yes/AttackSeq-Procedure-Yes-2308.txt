Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an adversary who has identified privileged users during the discovery phase using the PsLogList tool. The question asks if it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs include:

- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114-Email Collection: This TTP indicates that the adversary is collecting email messages.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery: This TTP is not directly related to the question but indicates that the adversary is gathering information about the system.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.001-Local Email Collection: This TTP specifically indicates that the adversary is collecting email messages from local systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the adversary has identified privileged users during the discovery phase, it is likely that they would want to collect information about these users, including their email communications. The fact that they are using the PsLogList tool suggests that they are interested in local system information. However, the question asks about collecting email messages from both local and remote systems.

Considering the related TTPs, the adversary is already collecting email messages (T1114-Email Collection) and has a specific technique for collecting local email messages (T1114.001-Local Email Collection). It is plausible that they would also collect email messages from remote systems as part of their collection activities.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems.

Final Answer: A
