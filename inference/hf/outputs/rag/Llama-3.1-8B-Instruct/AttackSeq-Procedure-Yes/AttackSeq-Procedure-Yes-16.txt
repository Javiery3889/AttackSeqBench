Comparison and Evaluation:
Given that the threat group has already impersonated the CEO, it is likely that they will continue to use tactics that maintain the illusion of legitimacy. Defense evasion techniques, such as using real domains to make emails appear legitimate, would be a natural progression of this tactic. Additionally, stressing confidentiality to prevent validation of the project would be consistent with the goal of maintaining the deception.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The threat group has already demonstrated the ability to impersonate the CEO, which suggests they are willing to use deception to achieve their goals.
2. The goal of the impersonation is likely to facilitate a malicious activity, such as a confidential acquisition.
3. Defense evasion techniques, such as using real domains and stressing confidentiality, would be consistent with the goal of maintaining the deception and preventing validation of the project.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the threat group will employ defense evasion tactics to make the emails appear legitimate and prevent validation of the project.
