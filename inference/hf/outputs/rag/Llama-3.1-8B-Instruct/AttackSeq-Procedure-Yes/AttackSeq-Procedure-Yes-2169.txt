To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking whether the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails after using a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing (general phishing)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (spear phishing with links)
     - Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (spear phishing with attachments)
   - These TTPs are related to initial access techniques, specifically phishing and spear phishing methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails. This is a specific type of spear phishing attack, which is described by T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - The question also mentions a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance. This is not explicitly mentioned in the provided TTPs, but it seems to be a reconnaissance technique that could be used before the initial access.
   - However, the question asks about gaining initial access, which is the focus of the provided TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions spear phishing with embedded links, which aligns with T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - The reconnaissance technique mentioned in the question is not directly related to the provided TTPs, but it's not necessary for the initial access.
   - Therefore, the most relevant TTP for the question is T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to spear phishing with embedded links, which is described by T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - Therefore, the answer is: Final Answer: A
