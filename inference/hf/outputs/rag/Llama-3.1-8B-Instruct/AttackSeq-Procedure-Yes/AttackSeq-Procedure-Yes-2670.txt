To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether, after OceanLotus achieves persistence by creating a Launch Agent and launching itself as a service from a new location, it is likely that the backdoor will gather system details and send the information back to its command and control server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent: This TTP is related to the initial action of OceanLotus, which involves creating a Launch Agent to gain persistence.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543-Create or Modify System Process: This TTP is also related to the persistence mechanism used by OceanLotus, which involves creating a new system process.
   - Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.001-Launch Agent: This TTP is the same as the first one, indicating that the Launch Agent is used for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Based on the related TTPs, we can infer that OceanLotus uses a Launch Agent for persistence. 
   - After achieving persistence, the next logical step for a backdoor like OceanLotus would be to gather system details and send them back to its command and control server. 
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys is a common technique used by backdoors to maintain communication with their command and control servers.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that OceanLotus will gather system details and send the information back to its command and control server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

**Final Answer: A**
