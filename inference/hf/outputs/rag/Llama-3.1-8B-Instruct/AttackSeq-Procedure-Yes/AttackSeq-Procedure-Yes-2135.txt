Analyzing the Question:
The question describes an initial access scenario where a phishing campaign delivers malware disguised as a Curriculum Vitae. The question asks whether the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info before proceeding to use other identified C2 domains.

Analyzing the Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing: This TTP indicates that the initial access was gained through a phishing campaign.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This TTP further refines the phishing technique to a spearphishing link, which is a more targeted and specific type of phishing attack.

Comparing and Evaluating:
Given that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing link (T1566.002), it is likely that the attackers would use a centralized command and control (C2) infrastructure to manage the malware. The C2 domain judystevenson[.]info is likely to be the primary C2 domain used for communication, at least initially. This is because attackers often use a primary C2 domain for initial communication and then switch to other C2 domains to avoid detection or to maintain persistence.

Therefore, it is plausible that the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info before proceeding to use other identified C2 domains.
