Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CosmicDuke malware, specifically during the Collection and Exfiltration phases. It asks whether the malware is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The provided Related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data from a system.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which aligns with the initial actions of the malware (keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer).
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol, which could be FTP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the Related TTPs, we can see that the malware has collected data from the local system (T1005) and is now in the Exfiltration phase. The question asks if the malware will automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP. The technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration suggests that the malware will use automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the question. Additionally, T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol suggests that the malware may use FTP, which is a non-C2 protocol.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites.

Final Answer: A
