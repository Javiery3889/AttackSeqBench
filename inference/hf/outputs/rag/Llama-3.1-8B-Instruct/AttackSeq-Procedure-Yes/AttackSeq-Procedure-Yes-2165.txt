To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the NetTraveler malware, including registering a C&C module as a service and using mutexes to prevent multiple instances. It then asks if the malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion: This technique involves using mutexes to prevent multiple instances of a malware from running.
     - T1543.003-Windows Service: This technique involves registering a malware as a Windows service to ensure persistence.
     - T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question describes the malware's persistence mechanism (registering a service and using mutexes) and asks about the likelihood of the malware using a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration.
   - The related TTPs provide context about the malware's persistence and evasion techniques, but they do not directly indicate the use of encryption for configuration obfuscation.
   - However, the fact that the malware is using advanced techniques like service registration and mutexes suggests that it may employ additional evasion techniques to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Given the malware's use of advanced persistence and evasion techniques, it is plausible that it would employ additional measures to evade detection, such as encryption or encoding.
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of a simple encryption scheme, which is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate configuration data.
   - Based on the context and the related TTPs, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would use a simple encryption scheme to protect its configuration data.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the analysis above, the most plausible answer is that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.

Final Answer: A
