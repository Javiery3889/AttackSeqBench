Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Aumlib malware evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques. This suggests that the malware is attempting to avoid detection by security controls that monitor network traffic.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools: This technique involves removing indicators of malicious activity from tools or malware to evade detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the question, the Aumlib malware has already evaded detection by altering HTTP communication patterns. This suggests that the malware is likely to continue using web protocols to communicate with a C2 server to receive updates or instructions. Sharing code with an older variant could be a way to maintain a consistent communication channel with the C2 server, which is a common tactic in command and control activity.

Considering the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of events is that the Aumlib malware will use web protocols to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols. This is consistent with the initial evasion technique used by the malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Aumlib malware evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.
2. This suggests that the malware is attempting to maintain a covert communication channel with a C2 server.
3. The use of web protocols (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is a common method for command and control activity.
4. Sharing code with an older variant could be a way to maintain a consistent communication channel with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
