Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence starting with phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. The malicious document is expected to execute a PowerShell script via a VBS macro, and then download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1204.002-Malicious File: This technique involves using a malicious file to gain initial access or execute malicious actions. In this case, the malicious file is a Word document.
- T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute malicious code. The question mentions that the PowerShell script is retrieved via a VBS macro.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the question describes an attack sequence that starts with a malicious file (T1204.002-Malicious File) and then uses PowerShell (T1059.001-PowerShell) to execute the malicious script. The question asks if the PowerShell script will execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the PowerShell script will execute and download the payloads. This is because the question describes a sequence of events that aligns with the related TTPs: a malicious file is used to gain initial access, and then PowerShell is used to execute the malicious script.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious Word document (T1204.002-Malicious File).
2. The malicious Word document contains a VBS macro that retrieves a PowerShell script.
3. The PowerShell script is executed (T1059.001-PowerShell).
4. The PowerShell script downloads payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Final Answer: A
