Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of the Gholee malware through a concatenated PE file using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32. It asks whether the malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to evade sandbox software before establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.002 - Code Signing: This TTP involves using a legitimate code signing process to make malware appear legitimate. However, in this case, the malware is using an expired digital certificate, which is not a typical code signing practice.
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011 - Rundll32: This TTP involves using Rundll32 to execute malicious code. Rundll32 is often used to execute DLLs, which can be used to hide malware.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the use of Rundll32 to execute the Gholee malware, it is likely that the malware will employ techniques to evade detection. However, the use of an expired digital certificate for establishing a secure command-and-control connection is not a typical practice for code signing. Considering the Defense Evasion TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware will employ obfuscation and other evasion techniques to avoid detection in a sandbox environment.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Gholee malware is executed using Rundll32, which is a technique used for Defense Evasion (T1218.011).
2. Given the use of Rundll32, it is likely that the malware will employ additional evasion techniques to avoid detection.
3. The use of an expired digital certificate for establishing a command-and-control connection is not a typical practice for code signing (T1553.002), but it could be used for other purposes, such as to make the connection appear legitimate.
4. Considering the Defense Evasion TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware will employ obfuscation and other evasion techniques to avoid detection in a sandbox environment.

Final Answer: A
