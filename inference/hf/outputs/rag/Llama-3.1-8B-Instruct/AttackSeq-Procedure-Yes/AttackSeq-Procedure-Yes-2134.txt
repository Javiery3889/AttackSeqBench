To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question is asking whether further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains used by the threat actor AridViper.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - **T1583.001-Domains**: This technique is related to the creation of domains for command and control (C2) purposes. It suggests that the threat actor is using domains to establish a communication channel with malware.
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique is related to the use of multiple channels to communicate with malware, which can include domains, URLs, or other communication channels. It implies that the threat actor is using a multi-stage approach to communicate with malware.
   - **T1071.004-DNS**: This technique is related to the use of DNS for C2 purposes, which can include domain name resolution, DNS tunneling, or other DNS-based communication methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the threat actor AridViper is using domains for C2 purposes (T1583.001-Domains) and communicating with malware through multiple channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels). The use of DNS (T1071.004-DNS) further supports this inference, as it is a common method for C2 communication.
   - The question asks whether further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains. Given the TTPs, it is likely that the threat actor is using a multi-domain approach for C2 communication, which would suggest that additional malware samples are communicating with multiple C2 domains.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Based on the related TTPs, it is likely that the threat actor AridViper is using a multi-domain approach for C2 communication.
   - The use of multiple C2 domains (T1583.001-Domains) and multi-stage channels (T1104-Multi-Stage Channels) supports this inference.
   - The use of DNS (T1071.004-DNS) further supports the use of C2 communication through multiple domains.
   - Therefore, it is likely that further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains.

Final Answer: A
