Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking whether the Aria-body backdoor, after gathering system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase, will proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

These TTPs are related to the Discovery phase of the attack, which involves gathering information about the target system. T1016 focuses on discovering network configuration, while T1082 focuses on gathering system information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, the Aria-body backdoor is currently in the Discovery phase, gathering system information and network configuration. The question asks if it will proceed to the Collection phase, which involves activities like creating/deleting files and taking screenshots. Typically, the Collection phase follows the Discovery phase, as the attacker has already gathered necessary information about the target system.

Considering the typical attack sequence, it is logical that the Aria-body backdoor would proceed to the Collection phase after gathering system information and network configuration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Aria-body backdoor will proceed to the Collection phase after gathering system information and network configuration.

Final Answer: A
