Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether Gamaredon's malware will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase. This implies that we need to understand the behavior of Gamaredon's malware in the context of the exfiltration phase.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

These TTPs indicate that the exfiltration phase involves the automated transfer of data from the compromised system to the C2 server. T1020-Automated Exfiltration specifically refers to the use of automated tools or scripts to exfiltrate data, while T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel refers to the transfer of data over the C2 channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the context of the exfiltration phase and the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice as follows:

A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the TTPs related to automated exfiltration and exfiltration over the C2 channel. It is likely that Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

B: No - This answer choice does not align with the TTPs related to automated exfiltration and exfiltration over the C2 channel. It is unlikely that Gamaredon's modules will not automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A
