To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton malware delivered through spearphishing emails with malicious links. It asks if BlueBravo is likely to use these malware loaders to gather system information before employing known malware families for continued operation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are focused on Initial Access, specifically T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link. This technique involves tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the delivery of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, we can infer that the initial step involves delivering malware through spearphishing. The question then asks about the next step in the attack sequence.
   - GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton are malware loaders, which are typically used to deliver additional malware or tools to the compromised system. Gathering system information (username, computer name, network connections) is a common step in the attack chain to prepare for further exploitation.
   - Employing known malware families for continued operation suggests that the attackers want to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have already delivered malware through spearphishing, which is a common Initial Access tactic.
   - The next logical step would be to gather system information to better understand the environment and prepare for further exploitation.
   - Using malware loaders like GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton to gather system information is a plausible next step, as it allows the attackers to collect valuable information without immediately employing more sophisticated or attention-grabbing malware.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlueBravo is likely to use these malware loaders to gather victim system information before employing known malware families for continued operation.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**
