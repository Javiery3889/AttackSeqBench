Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an XAgent app that executes itself in the background on iOS 7 devices, hides its icon, and restarts when terminated. This behavior suggests that the app is designed to maintain persistence and evade detection. The question asks whether the app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:

- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This TTP involves sending data from the compromised system to the C2 server, which is consistent with the question's description of the XAgent app sending collected data to its C&C server via HTTP.
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery: This TTP involves gathering information about the compromised system, which could include geo-location data.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the XAgent app is likely to collect system information, including geo-location data, as part of its discovery routine. This information will then be sent to its C&C server via HTTP, as described in T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The XAgent app executes itself in the background on iOS 7 devices, indicating that it is designed for persistence.
2. The app hides its icon and restarts when terminated, suggesting that it is trying to evade detection.
3. Given its persistence and evasion capabilities, it is likely that the app will perform some form of discovery to gather information about the compromised system.
4. The related TTPs suggest that the app will collect system information, including geo-location data, as part of its discovery routine.
5. The collected data will then be sent to the C&C server via HTTP, as described in T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: A
