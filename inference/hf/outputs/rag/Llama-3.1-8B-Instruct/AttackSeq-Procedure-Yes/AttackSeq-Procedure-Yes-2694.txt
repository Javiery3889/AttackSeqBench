To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack scenario where Elfin has established command and control (C2) using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT. It then asks if it's likely that they proceeded to exfiltrate data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel used for command and control. This could be a likely step after establishing C2.
   - Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data using a protocol other than the one used for C2. This could be a likely step after establishing C2, especially if the alternative protocol offers faster data transfer rates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Given that Elfin has already established C2 using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, it's plausible that they would use the same C2 channel (T1041) to exfiltrate data. However, the question also mentions using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, which is designed for faster data transfer. This suggests that they might be looking to use an alternative protocol (T1048) for exfiltration.
   - Considering the goal of using a faster data transfer method, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using an alternative protocol for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using an alternative protocol for exfiltration, which aligns with Technique: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: B
