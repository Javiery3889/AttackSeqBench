To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking whether it's likely that the campaign has already carried out activities involving the execution of PowerShell scripts and obfuscated macro scripts after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server via a specific domain.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are:
     - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001 - PowerShell: This technique involves the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is a common method for executing malicious code.
     - Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005 - Visual Basic: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros, which can be used to execute malicious code within Microsoft Office documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the campaign is likely to involve the execution of malicious code, specifically PowerShell scripts and VBA macros.
   - The question mentions the PRB-Backdoor communicating with its C&C server via a specific domain, which suggests that the campaign has already established a communication channel for command and control.
   - It's reasonable to assume that after establishing communication with the C&C server, the campaign would likely carry out activities involving the execution of PowerShell scripts and obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The campaign has established a communication channel with the C&C server via the PRB-Backdoor.
   - Given the related TTPs, it's likely that the campaign would use this communication channel to execute malicious code.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts (T1059.001) and the use of obfuscated macro scripts (T1059.005) are both plausible next steps in the campaign.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Based on the analysis, it's likely that the campaign would have already carried out activities involving the execution of PowerShell scripts and employed obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

Final Answer: A
