To answer this question, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question describes an attack where the attackers modified a Javascript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites. The question asks if it's likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are:

1. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.006 - HTML Smuggling: This TTP is related to hiding malicious code within legitimate HTML content, but it's not directly related to the question.
2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information: This TTP is directly related to the question, as it involves making files or information difficult to understand or analyze.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that the attackers are likely using defense evasion techniques to avoid detection. The question specifically mentions appending the malicious code to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer, which is a technique used for obfuscation.

Considering the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is appending the malicious code to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer, which is a form of obfuscation. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic and the Obfuscated Files or Information technique.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The attackers modified a Javascript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
2. To avoid detection, the attackers likely used a defense evasion technique.
3. The related TTPs suggest that the attackers used obfuscation, specifically encoding the malicious code with Dean Edwards Packer.
4. The question specifically mentions appending the malicious code to the existing Javascript file, which is a common method of obfuscation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
