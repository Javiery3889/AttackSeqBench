Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where an attacker, OnionDog, has infiltrated a target internal network using a USB worm. The question asks if OnionDog is likely to establish communication with a C&C server and download other malware using the OnionDog Trojan for further operations.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- T1561.002 - Disk Structure Wipe: This technique is related to Impact, which involves actions that cause significant disruption to the target environment. However, it does not directly relate to the scenario described in the question.
- T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique is related to Command and Control, which involves the transfer of tools or malware into the target environment. This technique is relevant to the question as it describes the transfer of malware, which aligns with the scenario of OnionDog downloading other malware using the OnionDog Trojan.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the most relevant technique is T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer, which involves the transfer of tools or malware into the target environment. This technique aligns with the scenario of OnionDog downloading other malware using the OnionDog Trojan for further operations.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that OnionDog will establish communication with a C&C server and download other malware using the OnionDog Trojan.

Final Answer: A
