To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is asking whether the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen on the infected system.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are related to Exfiltration, specifically T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This TTP indicates that the adversary is exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions the Milestone backdoor discovering system information and capturing the screen on the infected system. This implies that the backdoor has already gathered some form of data.
   - The question then asks if the backdoor will exfiltrate this data over the C2 channel. Given that the related TTP is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, it is logical to assume that the backdoor would use this channel to exfiltrate the gathered data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Milestone backdoor has the capability to discover system information and capture the screen on the infected system.
   - The backdoor has gathered some form of data from the infected system.
   - The related TTP (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) indicates that the adversary is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate the gathered data over the C2 channel.

5. **Final Answer:** 
   Final Answer: A
