Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained initial access to an organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacons and have collected administrative-level credentials. The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts: This TTP indicates that the attackers have gained access to the network using domain accounts, which is consistent with the scenario described in the question.
- Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This TTP suggests that the attackers will move laterally across the network, which is also consistent with the scenario described in the question.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers have already gained initial access to the network and have the capability to move laterally. The presence of T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer suggests that the attackers will use this technique to move laterally across the network. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will compromise numerous workstations and target internal hosts and servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already gained initial access to the network using Cobalt Strike beacons and collected administrative-level credentials.
2. The related TTP T1078.002-Domain Accounts indicates that the attackers used domain accounts to gain access, which is consistent with the scenario.
3. The related TTP T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer suggests that the attackers will move laterally across the network.
4. Given the attackers' initial access and the presence of lateral movement TTP, it is likely that they will compromise numerous workstations and target internal hosts and servers.

Final Answer: A
