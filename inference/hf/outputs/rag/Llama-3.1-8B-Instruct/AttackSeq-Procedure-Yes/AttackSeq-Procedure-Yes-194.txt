Analysis of the Question:
The question describes an attack sequence involving Initial Access through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications and subsequent Execution using SparrowDoor. The question asks whether SparrowDoor will likely communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with the C&C server. HTTPS is a web protocol that encrypts data in transit.
- Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain access to a system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can infer that the attackers are likely to use web protocols for Command and Control. Since HTTPS is a common web protocol that encrypts data, it is plausible that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

Answer Choice A (Yes) aligns with the related TTPs, as it suggests the use of a web protocol (HTTPS) for Command and Control, which is consistent with the given techniques.

Answer Choice B (No) does not align with the related TTPs, as it suggests the use of an unencrypted channel, which is not consistent with the use of web protocols for Command and Control.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access, which is consistent with T1190.
2. They executed SparrowDoor for Execution, which is not directly related to the given TTPs but is a part of the attack sequence.
3. The question asks whether SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.
4. Given the related TTPs, it is likely that the attackers will use a web protocol (HTTPS) for Command and Control, making Answer Choice A the most plausible.

Final Answer: A
