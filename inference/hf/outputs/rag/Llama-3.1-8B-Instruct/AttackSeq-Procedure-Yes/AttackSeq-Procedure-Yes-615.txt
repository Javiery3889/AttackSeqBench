Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by an attacker. The sequence involves employing obfuscation within a Visual Basic Script (VBS) script for defense evasion and configuring the script to delete itself post-execution. The question asks whether it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a command and control (C&C) server.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1216.001-PubPrn: This TTP is related to the use of public printers to evade detection. However, it is not directly related to the given scenario.
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic: This TTP is related to the use of Visual Basic scripts for execution. This is relevant to the given scenario as the VBS script is used for execution.

Given the information, the relevant TTP is the use of Visual Basic scripts for execution. This suggests that the VBS script is being used to execute malicious code. The fact that the script is obfuscated and configured to delete itself post-execution implies that the script is designed to evade detection and maintain persistence.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Considering the given TTPs and the scenario, it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions or to report back to the attacker. This is a common behavior of malware that uses scripts for execution.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The VBS script is used for execution (T1059.005-Visual Basic).
2. The script is obfuscated for defense evasion.
3. The script is configured to delete itself post-execution, indicating an attempt to maintain persistence.
4. Given the execution of a VBS script and the attempt to evade detection, it is likely that the script will communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions or to report back to the attacker.

Final Answer: A
