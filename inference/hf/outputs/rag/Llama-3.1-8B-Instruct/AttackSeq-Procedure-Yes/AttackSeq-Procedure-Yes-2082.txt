Analysis of the Question:
The question is asking whether RIG EK (Rig Exploit Kit) is likely to use malvertising as a method to deliver exploits after gaining capabilities on victim machines.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1583.008-Malvertising: This technique involves using malicious advertising to deliver malware or exploits.
- T1204.001-Malicious Link: This technique involves using malicious links to deliver malware or exploits.
- T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a victim's system by exploiting vulnerabilities in a website or application.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, it appears that RIG EK is likely to use malvertising as a method to deliver exploits. Malvertising (T1583.008) is a technique that involves using malicious advertising to deliver malware or exploits, which aligns with the question. Additionally, the question mentions using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, which is a common method used by exploit kits like RIG EK.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, which is a common method used by exploit kits.
2. After gaining capabilities on victim machines, RIG EK is likely to use a technique to deliver exploits to the victims.
3. Malvertising (T1583.008) is a technique that involves using malicious advertising to deliver malware or exploits, which aligns with the question.
4. Malvertising is often used in conjunction with drive-by compromise (T1189) to deliver exploits to victims.
5. Therefore, it is likely that RIG EK will use malvertising to deliver exploits to victims after gaining capabilities on their machines.

Final Answer: A
