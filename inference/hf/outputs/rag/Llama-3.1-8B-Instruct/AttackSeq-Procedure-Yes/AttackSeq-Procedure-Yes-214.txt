To answer this question, let's analyze the question and the related TTPs.

**Analyzing the Question:**
The question is asking whether Elirks malware retrieved its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites. This implies that the malware is using a technique to obtain its C2 server address from a third-party service.

**Analyzing the Related TTPs:**
The related TTPs are all related to Command and Control (C2) tactics and techniques. Specifically:

- T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique involves using a third-party service to resolve a C2 server address.
- T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication: This technique involves using a third-party service for bidirectional communication between the attacker and the malware.
- T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the C2 server.

**Comparing and Evaluating:**
Based on the related TTPs, we can see that all of them involve using a third-party service to communicate with the C2 server or resolve the C2 server address. The question specifically mentions accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites, which aligns with the Dead Drop Resolver technique (T1102.001). This technique involves using a third-party service to resolve a C2 server address, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question is asking about Elirks malware retrieving its C2 server address from a third-party service.
2. The related TTPs all involve using a third-party service for C2 communication or server address resolution.
3. The Dead Drop Resolver technique (T1102.001) specifically involves using a third-party service to resolve a C2 server address.
4. The question aligns with the Dead Drop Resolver technique, as it mentions accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites to obtain the C2 server address.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
