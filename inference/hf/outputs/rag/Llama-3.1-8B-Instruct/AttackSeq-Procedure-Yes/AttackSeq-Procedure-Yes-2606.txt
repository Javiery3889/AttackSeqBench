Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where NanHaiShu malware gathers system information from compromised machines and uploads it to a C&C server via HTTP POST. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs include:
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a system to an attacker-controlled system.
- Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves gathering data from a local system, which aligns with the initial action of gathering system information from compromised machines.
- Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves exfiltrating data through a C2 channel, which aligns with the action of uploading data to the C&C server via HTTP POST.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Based on the related TTPs, it is clear that the malware is designed for data collection and exfiltration. The initial action of gathering system information (T1005) and uploading it to the C&C server (T1041) suggests a data exfiltration process. The fact that the malware is gathering system information and uploading it to the C&C server via HTTP POST implies that it is likely to receive additional instructions or code for further data exfiltration, including executing JScript and VBScript code for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

Final Answer: A
