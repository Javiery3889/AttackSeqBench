To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document. These scripts are executed through macro-triggered events. The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - T1059.001-PowerShell: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute scripts, which is already mentioned in the question.
   - T1027.010-Command Obfuscation: This technique involves obfuscating commands to evade detection, which is also mentioned in the question.
   - T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which is relevant to the initial access gained by decoding PowerShell scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question describes an initial access gained by decoding PowerShell scripts. This is a form of deobfuscation (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).
   - After decoding the scripts, the next logical step would be to use these decoded scripts to achieve the attacker's goals, which could include dropping components like invoker.ps1 for persistence (T1059.001-PowerShell).
   - Finally, to evade detection, the attacker might employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload (T1027.010-Command Obfuscation).

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to decode the PowerShell scripts (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), use the decoded scripts to drop components for persistence (T1059.001-PowerShell), and then employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload (T1027.010-Command Obfuscation).

**Final Answer: A**
