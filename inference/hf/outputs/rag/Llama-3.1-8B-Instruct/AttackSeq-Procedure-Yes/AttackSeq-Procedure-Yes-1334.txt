To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved lateral movement through the use of the net use command, confirmed via ping communication with the target device. The question asks if it is likely that the version RAT (Remote Access Tool) malware will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) servers using compromised legitimate websites with communication data encrypted by AES and Base64.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs**:
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This TTP involves using web protocols to communicate with C2 servers. This could involve using compromised websites to send and receive data.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This TTP involves encoding data to evade detection. Base64 is a common encoding technique used for this purpose.
   - Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This TTP involves using symmetric encryption to protect data in transit. AES is a common symmetric encryption algorithm.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question mentions the use of compromised legitimate websites, which aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols.
   - The question also mentions encryption using AES and Base64, which aligns with T1132.001-Standard Encoding and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography.
   - Given that the question describes a scenario where the attacker is using a RAT malware, it is likely that the attacker would use techniques to evade detection and maintain control over the malware, which would involve encryption and encoding.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the RAT malware will communicate with its C2 servers using compromised legitimate websites, with communication data encrypted by AES and Base64.

**Final Answer: A**
