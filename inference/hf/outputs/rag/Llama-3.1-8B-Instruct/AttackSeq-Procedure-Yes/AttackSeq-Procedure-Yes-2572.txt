Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions, decoding JavaScript payloads, and dropping a file into the system's temporary directory. It then asks if a JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while another file, 'surprise.php', reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
- T1027.006-HTML Smuggling: This technique involves manipulating HTML content to evade detection by security controls. It can be used to smuggle malicious content within a legitimate-looking webpage.
- T1059.007-JavaScript: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute malicious code on a system. It can be used to download and execute files, among other malicious activities.
- T1059.005-Visual Basic: This technique involves using Visual Basic (VBA) macros to execute malicious code. It can be used to decode and execute payloads, such as JavaScript.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Based on the related TTPs, the sequence of actions described in the question seems to involve the use of VBA macros to decode JavaScript payloads, which is consistent with T1059.005-Visual Basic. The use of JavaScript to execute malicious code is also consistent with T1059.007-JavaScript. However, the mention of 'surprise.php' and iframe suggests a web-based attack, which is more closely related to T1027.006-HTML Smuggling.

Given the sequence of actions, it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe. This is because the use of JavaScript and VBA macros to decode payloads and execute malicious code is consistent with the techniques described in the related TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads, which is consistent with T1059.005-Visual Basic.
2. The use of JavaScript to execute malicious code is consistent with T1059.007-JavaScript.
3. The mention of 'surprise.php' and iframe suggests a web-based attack, which is more closely related to T1027.006-HTML Smuggling.
4. Given the sequence of actions, it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.
