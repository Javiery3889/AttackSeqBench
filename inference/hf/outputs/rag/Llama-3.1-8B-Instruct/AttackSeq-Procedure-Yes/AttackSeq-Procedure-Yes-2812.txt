Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where the Derusbi malware is gathering system information and sending it to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via port 443. The question asks if it is likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Analysis of Related TTPs:
The related TTPs are related to Command and Control (C2) and Web Protocols (T1071.001). This indicates that the question is focused on how the malware communicates with its C2 infrastructure using web protocols.

Comparison and Evaluation:
Given the related TTPs, we can evaluate each answer choice as follows:

- Answer A: Yes. This answer choice aligns with the TTPs related to C2 and web protocols. Derusbi malware using HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and including HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions is a plausible scenario, as it fits within the context of C2 communication using web protocols.

- Answer B: No. This answer choice does not align with the TTPs related to C2 and web protocols. It is unlikely that the Derusbi malware would not employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions, given the context of the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes Derusbi malware gathering system information and sending it to the C2 infrastructure via port 443, which is a common port for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS).
2. The related TTPs indicate that the question is focused on C2 and web protocols, specifically T1071.001-Web Protocols.
3. Given the context of C2 communication using web protocols, it is plausible that the Derusbi malware would employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Final Answer: A
