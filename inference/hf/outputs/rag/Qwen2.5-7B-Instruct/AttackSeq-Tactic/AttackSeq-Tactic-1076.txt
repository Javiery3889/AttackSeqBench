Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The SLUB backdoor downloaded and parsed a 'gist' snippet from GitHub.
2. It retrieved the username and computer name.
3. Data was exfiltrated through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This tactic involves the removal of data from an information system to a destination outside of the local network.
- **Command and Control (T1102-Web Service)**: This tactic involves the use of a web service for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question. Resource Development involves the creation or acquisition of resources to support the adversary's objectives, which does not align with the described actions.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic is directly related to the final action described in the question, which is the exfiltration of data through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel. However, the question asks which tactic most likely occurred **before** the exfiltration, not during or after.

- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves the gathering of information about the network, systems, and users. The actions described (downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet, retrieving the username and computer name) align well with the Discovery tactic. This is a logical step before exfiltration, as the adversary needs to understand the environment to identify what data to exfiltrate.

- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the ability to direct the compromised system. While this is a relevant tactic, the specific actions described (downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet, retrieving the username and computer name) are more closely aligned with Discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before the exfiltration of data.
- The actions described (downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet, retrieving the username and computer name) are clearly part of the Discovery tactic.
- Exfiltration is the final action, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred before it.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
