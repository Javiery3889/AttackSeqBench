Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers initially infect servers and then manually spread using an Explosive Trojan. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial spread.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to move laterally within a network.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to gain initial access to a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to a network, which has already been described in the question. The question is asking what happened after the initial access.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. The question mentions that the attackers spread manually across the network, which aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised systems. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the spread across the network.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves running code or commands on a system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most direct continuation of the spread across the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the attackers using initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network. This indicates a movement from one system to another within the network.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for lateral movement, such as using SMB/Windows admin shares and transferring tools.
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial spread would be the attackers moving laterally across the network to compromise other systems.

### Final Answer: B
