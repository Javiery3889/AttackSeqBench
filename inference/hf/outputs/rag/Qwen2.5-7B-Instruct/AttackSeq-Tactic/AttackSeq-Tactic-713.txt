Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Naikon APT group initially gains access through methods like weaponized RTF files exploiting RoyalRoad or DLL hijacking. The next step involves the Aria-body loader being injected into processes, which then decrypts configuration data and contacts C&C servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step where the adversary gains access to the target network.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This is a technique under Initial Access where the adversary exploits a vulnerability in a public-facing application.
- **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** This is the process of gaining higher-level access to a system.
- **Dynamic-link Library Injection (Technique):** This is a technique under Privilege Escalation where the adversary injects a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step, but the question already mentions that the group has gained initial access through weaponized RTF files. Therefore, this step has already occurred.
- **Persistence (B):** This is a tactic that follows Initial Access and involves maintaining access to the target network. However, the question does not mention any persistence techniques.
- **Discovery (C):** This is a tactic that involves the adversary learning about the target's environment. While this could occur, it is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **Execution (D):** This is a tactic that involves the adversary running malicious code. The Aria-body loader being injected into processes and decrypting configuration data and contacting C&C servers is a form of execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already gained initial access.
- The next step involves the Aria-body loader being injected into processes, which is a form of execution.
- The techniques mentioned in the related TTPs (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection) align with the steps of gaining access and then executing the Aria-body loader.

### Final Answer: D
