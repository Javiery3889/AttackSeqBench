Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT28 identified vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server following their IP range scans. This implies that the sequence of TTPs should logically precede the identification of vulnerable systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning a range of IP addresses to identify active hosts.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning a range of IP addresses to identify vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from various sources. While it is a broad category, it does not specifically align with the scanning and vulnerability identification techniques mentioned.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. It is not directly related to the scanning and vulnerability identification techniques.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target environment. While it is a prerequisite for any attack, it does not directly align with the scanning and vulnerability identification techniques.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems within the target environment. It aligns well with the scanning and vulnerability identification techniques, as it involves identifying active hosts and vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question mentions that APT28 identified vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server following their IP range scans. This indicates that the scanning and vulnerability identification processes are part of the attack sequence.
- **Step 2**: The related TTPs specifically mention scanning IP blocks and vulnerability scanning, which are part of the reconnaissance tactic.
- **Step 3**: Among the answer choices, **Discovery (D)** is the most relevant tactic as it directly aligns with the scanning and vulnerability identification processes described in the question.

### Final Answer: D
