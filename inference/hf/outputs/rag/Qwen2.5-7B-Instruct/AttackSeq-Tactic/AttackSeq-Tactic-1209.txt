Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Reconnaissance through the SocGholish framework on compromised websites.
2. Execution of commands via PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's system. The reconnaissance through SocGholish and compromising websites would fall under this tactic.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target system, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or commands on the target system. The execution of commands via PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon is a clear example of this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The reconnaissance through SocGholish and compromising websites is a form of Initial Access.
2. The execution of commands via PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon is a form of Execution.
3. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the reconnaissance and **before** the execution.
4. The reconnaissance (Initial Access) is a prerequisite for the execution (Execution) of the commands.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (Reconnaissance)
- Execution (Deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon via PowerShell)

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the reconnaissance and before the execution is Execution.

**Final Answer: D**
