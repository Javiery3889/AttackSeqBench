Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors used spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims in the CIS countries.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Initial Access and the Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link.
   - This indicates that the initial compromise was achieved through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution typically involves the running of code or the execution of a payload. While this could be a step after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after the compromise.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - Credential access involves obtaining user credentials, which is a common step after an initial compromise. If the threat actors have gained access to the network or system, they would likely attempt to obtain credentials to move further.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource development involves the creation of tools, infrastructure, or other resources. This is a more advanced step and is not the immediate next step after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial access is the tactic used to gain a foothold in the target environment. Since the question already states that the initial access was achieved through spear-phishing, this is not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to use the compromised system to obtain credentials, as this would allow the threat actors to move further within the network.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
