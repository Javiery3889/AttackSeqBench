Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a lure document with a macro is enabled, which triggers malicious PowerShell commands. The next step in the sequence is the employment of obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file.
- **Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or interference from defensive measures. While this could be a part of the overall campaign, it is not the immediate precursor to the use of obfuscated scripts.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves the process of transferring data from the target to the attacker. This is not directly related to the immediate steps leading to the use of obfuscated scripts.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is a common goal, it is not the immediate precursor to the use of obfuscated scripts.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker's first step to gain a foothold on the target system. Given that the question mentions enabling a macro within a lure document, this is the most likely initial access method, as it is the first step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence starting with enabling a macro in a lure document, which triggers malicious PowerShell commands.
2. The related TTPs mention the execution of malicious files and the use of PowerShell.
3. The immediate precursor to the use of obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload is the initial access method, which is the first step in the sequence.
4. Among the given options, **Initial Access (D)** is the most plausible tactic that occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts.

### Final Answer: D
