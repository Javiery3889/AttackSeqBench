Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Dumping Windows cached password hashes.
2. Cracking the passwords.
3. Using the cracked credentials to access additional systems.
4. Traversing the network to find servers with sensitive intellectual property.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials from a system.
  - **T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials**: This technique involves dumping cached credentials.
  - **T1110.002-Password Cracking**: This technique involves cracking the obtained credentials.
  - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the same network. While this is a crucial step in the sequence, it is not the first step. The first step is obtaining the credentials.
  
- **B: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying and gathering information about the network and its resources. This is a step that might occur after obtaining credentials, but it is not the first step in the sequence.
  
- **C: Credential Access**
  - Credential access involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the first step of the sequence (dumping cached password hashes and cracking them). This is the most relevant tactic for the initial phase of the attack.
  
- **D: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering data or information from a system. This is a step that might occur after gaining access, but it is not the first step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with obtaining credentials, which is the primary focus of the question.
- The related TTPs clearly indicate that the first step is "Credential Access" (T1003.005-Cached Domain Credentials, T1110.002-Password Cracking, T1003-OS Credential Dumping).
- After obtaining the credentials, the attackers use them to move laterally and discover sensitive information.

### Final Answer: C: Credential Access
