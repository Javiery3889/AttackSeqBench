Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
- Domain administrator privileges were obtained using tools like Mimikatz.
- PsExec and WinExe were used to spread across the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is not directly related to the spread across the network.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic is related to obtaining higher-level access, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the spread across the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access over time, which is not directly related to the spread across the network.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to the network, which is not the focus of the question.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic is about obtaining higher-level access, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to get domain administrator privileges.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within the network, which aligns with the use of PsExec and WinExe to spread across the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: This is the first step where the attackers gain initial access to the network.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: After gaining initial access, the attackers use tools like Mimikatz to escalate their privileges to domain administrator.
3. **Lateral Movement**: With domain administrator privileges, the attackers use tools like PsExec and WinExe to move laterally across the network.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement, as it directly addresses the spread across the network after obtaining the necessary privileges.

### Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
