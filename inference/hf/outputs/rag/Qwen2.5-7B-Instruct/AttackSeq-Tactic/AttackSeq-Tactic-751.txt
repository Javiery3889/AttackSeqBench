Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. An attack tactic occurred before the exfiltration of harvested documents to the C&C server.
2. An attack tactic occurred after the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
- **Web Protocols (Technique):** This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for communication with the C&C infrastructure.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the target's systems.
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique):** This technique involves using a command and control (C&C) channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Option A: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration is a tactic that occurs after the data has been harvested and is ready to be sent out.
  - The question states that exfiltration occurred after the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.
  - This does not fit the sequence as exfiltration should be the final step after data has been harvested and communication has been established.

- **Option B: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement is a tactic that involves moving from one system to another within the target network.
  - This does not fit the sequence as it is not mentioned in the related TTPs and does not align with the communication and exfiltration steps.

- **Option C: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control is a tactic that involves establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
  - The related TTPs mention the use of web protocols (HTTP and HTTPS) for communication with the C&C infrastructure.
  - This fits the sequence as establishing a C&C channel would be necessary before using it for communication and exfiltration.

- **Option D: Persistence**
  - Persistence is a tactic that involves maintaining access to the target's systems over time.
  - While persistence is important, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and does not align with the communication and exfiltration steps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves establishing a C&C channel (Command and Control) before using it for communication (HTTP and HTTPS) and then exfiltrating data.
- The related TTPs confirm the use of web protocols for C&C communication and exfiltration over a C&C channel.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is establishing a C&C channel (Command and Control) before using it for communication and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
