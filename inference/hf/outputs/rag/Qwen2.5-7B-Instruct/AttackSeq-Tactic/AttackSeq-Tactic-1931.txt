Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware "Machete":
1. Utilized standard FTP and HTTP ports to communicate with its command and control servers.
2. Implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This suggests that the malware is using the command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This indicates that the malware has fallback channels for maintaining communication with the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the theft of credentials. The question does not mention any credential theft, so this is unlikely.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. The question mentions document exfiltration, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. While the fallback channels might be a form of evasion, the primary focus of the question is on the exfiltration of data.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the establishment and maintenance of the C2 channel. While the question mentions the C2 channel, the focus is on the exfiltration of data, not just the C2 channel itself.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of standard ports and fallback channels for document exfiltration.
- The related TTPs mention exfiltration over the C2 channel and fallback channels for C2.
- The primary action described in the question is the exfiltration of data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
