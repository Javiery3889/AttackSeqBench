Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and then modified a specific file (`jquery-1.4.2.min.js`) to conduct a strategic web compromise. This indicates that the attackers have already gained access to the server and are now performing an action to maintain or extend their control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Drive-by Compromise." This suggests that the initial step of gaining access to the server is already covered by the "Initial Access" tactic. The question is asking about the next step after gaining access, which is the modification of the file to maintain control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing a means to control the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the modification of the file.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the attackers taking steps to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, it is not directly related to the modification of the file.
- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about the initial step of gaining access to the system. The question already states that the attackers have gained access, so this is not the next step.
- **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attackers developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure they use to carry out their attacks. The modification of the file (`jquery-1.4.2.min.js`) to maintain control is a form of resource development, as it involves creating a persistent backdoor or modifying a critical component to ensure ongoing access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained access to the CDN server.
- The next step is to modify a file to maintain control, which is a form of resource development.
- The related TTPs do not directly support "Command and Control" or "Defense Evasion" as the next step after gaining access.
- "Initial Access" is already covered by the scenario, as the attackers have gained access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Resource Development.

**Final Answer: D: Resource Development**
