Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Executing CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
2. Creating a .vbs script to download additional payloads.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to ensure the recurring execution of malicious payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to maintain or establish a foothold.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic Scripting to execute code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that an attacker uses to maintain access to a network or system over time. Ensuring recurring execution of malicious payloads is a key aspect of persistence.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques that an attacker uses to avoid detection by security tools. While this could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly address the recurring execution of payloads.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves techniques that an attacker uses to steal data from a network or system. This is not directly related to the recurring execution of payloads.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves techniques that an attacker uses to move from one system to another within a network. This is also not directly related to the recurring execution of payloads.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve executing a disguised executable and creating a script to download additional payloads. This suggests that the attacker is setting up a mechanism to ensure that these malicious payloads are executed repeatedly.
- The related TTPs mention Command and Control and Execution techniques, which are consistent with the described actions.
- Among the given options, **Persistence (A)** is the most relevant tactic because it directly addresses the need to ensure that malicious payloads are executed repeatedly over time.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
