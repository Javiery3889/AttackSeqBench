Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Grandoreiro collects victim information and then communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server over HTTP. The key points are:
- Information collection (computer name, username, installed security products)
- Communication over HTTP to a C&C server

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**A: Lateral Movement**
- Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This does not align with the described sequence of collecting information and communicating over HTTP to a C&C server.

**B: Discovery**
- Discovery involves identifying information about the target environment. While this could be part of the initial phase, it does not directly align with the communication over HTTP to a C&C server.

**C: Command and Control**
- Command and Control (C&C) involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. This aligns well with the described sequence of collecting information and then communicating over HTTP to a C&C server.

**D: Impact**
- Impact involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. This is a later stage and does not align with the described sequence of information collection and communication over HTTP.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Grandoreiro collects victim information and then communicates over HTTP to a C&C server.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the Command and Control tactic and the use of Web Protocols (T1071.001) for communication.
- Among the answer choices, only "Command and Control" (C) aligns with the described sequence and the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
