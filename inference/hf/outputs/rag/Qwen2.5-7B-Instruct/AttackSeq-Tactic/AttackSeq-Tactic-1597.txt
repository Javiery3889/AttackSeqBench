Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that persistence was established with C2 beaconing, and the internal security team verified that a certain tactic did not take place. We need to identify which tactic fits this scenario.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Persistence**: Techniques include T1078-Valid Accounts and T1205-Traffic Signaling.
- **Command and Control**: Techniques include T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. It is unlikely to be verified as not having taken place after persistence is established.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is related to persistence, it is not typically verified as not having taken place.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources. It is a logical step after persistence but is not typically verified as not having taken place.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving across the network to other systems. It is a step that can be verified as not having taken place, making it a plausible answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Persistence**: Established with C2 beaconing (T1078-Valid Accounts and T1205-Traffic Signaling).
- **Verification**: The internal security team verified that a tactic did not take place.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This is a step that can be verified as not having taken place. It involves moving to other systems, which can be detected and confirmed by the security team.

### Final Answer: D
