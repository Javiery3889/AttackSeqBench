Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a Ukrainian organization was compromised by Shuckworm through a phishing email that delivered a malicious document containing the Pterodo backdoor. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about the initial access technique used:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious document via email.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the scenario, the phishing email delivered a malicious document (Pterodo backdoor). This aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A: Execution**: This tactic involves the process of running or executing malware or other code. While this is a step that follows initial access, it is not the immediate next step after the initial access.
- **B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The question already states that the organization was compromised, so this is not the next step.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This is a step that follows the execution of the malware.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the theft of data from the compromised system. This is a step that typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and has collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The organization was compromised through a phishing email (Initial Access).
2. The malicious document (Pterodo backdoor) was executed on the system (Execution).
3. The next logical step would be for the attacker to establish a command and control channel to communicate with the compromised system and potentially exfiltrate data.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
