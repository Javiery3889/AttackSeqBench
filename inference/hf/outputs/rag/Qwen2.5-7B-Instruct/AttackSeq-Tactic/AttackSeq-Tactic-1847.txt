Let's break down the question and analyze the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Context**: BlueDelta conducted discovery activities by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather system and network information.
- **Sequence**: The question asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the discovery activities but before the automation of exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (related to the exploitation of Roundcube webmail software).
- **Collection**: T1114.001-Local Email Collection (related to collecting email information).
- **Discovery**: T1518-Software Discovery (related to discovering software on the system).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (T1518-Software Discovery)**: This TTP is directly related to the initial discovery activities by BlueDelta.
- **Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection)**: This TTP is related to collecting email information, which is a form of data gathering but not the final step before exfiltration.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This TTP is related to establishing a channel for command and control, which typically happens after data has been collected and before exfiltration.
- **Resource Development**: This TTP is not directly related to the sequence of activities described.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovery**: BlueDelta conducted discovery activities by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather system and network information.
2. **Collection**: After discovery, the next logical step would be to collect the gathered information, such as system and network details.
3. **Command and Control**: The final step before exfiltration would be to establish a channel for command and control to automate the exfiltration process.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence of activities and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery (T1518-Software Discovery)
- Collection (T1114.001-Local Email Collection)
- Command and Control (T1071-External Remote Services)

However, since the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after discovery but before exfiltration, the most appropriate answer is:

Final Answer: B: Collection
