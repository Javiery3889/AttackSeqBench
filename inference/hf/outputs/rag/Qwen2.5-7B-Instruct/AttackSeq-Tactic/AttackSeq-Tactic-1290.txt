Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where encrypted data is uploaded to a malicious web server after communication with a C2 server. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):**
  - Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols
  - Technique: T1071.004-DNS
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):**
  - Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (Tactic):**
  - **T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves using web protocols for command and control communication. This could be the initial step where the attacker communicates with the C2 server.
  - **T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control communication. This could also be a method for the initial C2 communication.

- **Exfiltration (Tactic):**
  - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data. This is the action described in the question where encrypted data is uploaded to a malicious web server.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Communication with C2 Server:**
   - The question mentions communication with a C2 server at IP address 107.6.182.179. This communication is likely to be part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The related TTPs include T1071.001-Web Protocols and T1071.004-DNS, both of which are used for C2 communication.

2. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - After the initial communication, the encrypted data is uploaded to a malicious web server. This action aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
   - The related TTP for Exfiltration is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the Exfiltration tactic. The initial communication with the C2 server is part of Command and Control, and the subsequent uploading of encrypted data to a malicious web server is part of Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
