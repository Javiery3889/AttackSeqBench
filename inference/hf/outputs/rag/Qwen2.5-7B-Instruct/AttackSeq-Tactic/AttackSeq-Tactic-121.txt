Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'Surtr' malware is executed.
2. A new process is created using the CreateRemoteThread function.
3. The malware lists file directories on the victim computer.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the file system to understand the environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the execution of the malware and before the file directory listing.

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is more about evading detection and is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **C: Execution**: This tactic is about running code or scripts, which is part of the initial execution of the malware. However, it does not fit the sequence as it is the first step.
- **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. The listing of file directories is a form of reconnaissance to understand the file system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware is executed.
2. A new process is created using the CreateRemoteThread function (Execution TTP).
3. The malware lists file directories (Reconnaissance TTP).

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the execution and before the file directory listing is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
