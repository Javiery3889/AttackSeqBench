Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG-3279 used a port scanning tool and an RDP brute force tool to scan and exploit targets. This implies that the tactic should precede the use of these tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying services running on a network, which is a common step before port scanning.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using RDP to move laterally within a network, which is a step that occurs after initial access and reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to identify potential entry points. While it is a broad term, it does not specifically align with the use of a port scanning tool or RDP brute force.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems within it, which aligns well with the use of a port scanning tool (T1046-Network Service Discovery) and RDP brute force (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol).
- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing the resources needed for an attack, which is not directly related to the use of scanning and brute force tools.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender, which is not directly related to the use of scanning and brute force tools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the use of a port scanning tool and an RDP brute force tool.
- The related TTPs indicate that the use of a port scanning tool (T1046-Network Service Discovery) and RDP brute force (T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol) are part of the Discovery tactic.
- Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before these actions is Discovery.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
