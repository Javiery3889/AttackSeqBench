Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gathered information about the victim's computer (OS version, username, anti-virus details).
2. Used a backdoor to send exfiltrated data (files and screenshots) over a C&C channel.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves sending data over a Command and Control (C2) channel.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's system, such as OS version, username, and anti-virus details.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This is related to the exfiltration technique (T1041) but does not directly describe the initial gathering of information.
- **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
  - This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question (gathering OS version, username, and anti-virus details).
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which is not directly related to the initial gathering of information.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering information, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question (gathering OS version, username, and anti-virus details).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial gathering of information about the victim's computer, which is a clear indication of reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs confirm that the technique T1082 (System Information Discovery) is part of the Discovery tactic, which aligns with the initial actions.
- The exfiltration of data (files and screenshots) over a C&C channel is a later step and is part of the Exfiltration tactic.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial gathering of information, which is best described by the Reconnaissance tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
