Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Iron group:
1. The malware determines the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security.
2. The malware chooses its installation method accordingly.
3. The group uses dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves the malware discovering security software on the system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves the malware evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the malware's actions after discovering security software.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. It is not directly related to the sequence as it comes after the malware has already chosen its installation method.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the malware discovering information about the target environment. The question states that the malware determines the presence of security software, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the malware evading detection by the target's defenses. The question mentions the use of dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. The malware first discovers the presence of security software (360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security), which is a Discovery tactic.
2. After discovering the security software, the malware chooses its installation method accordingly. This step is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs but is a logical next step after discovery.
3. The malware then uses dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection, which is a Defense Evasion tactic.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
- Discovery (T1518.001-Security Software Discovery)
- (Installation method choice, not explicitly listed but logical)
- Defense Evasion (T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion)

Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is:
Final Answer: D
