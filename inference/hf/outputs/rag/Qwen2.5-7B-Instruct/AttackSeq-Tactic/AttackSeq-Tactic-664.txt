Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Base64 blobs are embedded in Office documents for execution.
2. A DLL (KerrDown) is dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Persistence**: Technique T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
- **Defense Evasion**: Technique T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
- **Defense Evasion**: Technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory.

- **Persistence (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading)**: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process's address space without writing it to disk. This could be a method to execute the DLL in memory, but it doesn't directly address how the base64 blobs were used or how the initial access was made.
- **Defense Evasion (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading)**: This technique is similar to Persistence and involves loading a DLL into memory. However, it is more focused on evading detection and defenses.
- **Defense Evasion (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information)**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding information to make it usable. This could be relevant if the base64 blobs needed to be decoded before execution.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The base64 blobs embedded in Office documents suggest an initial access method, likely involving social engineering or a phishing attack.
2. **Deobfuscation/Decoding**: The base64 blobs need to be decoded to be executable, which aligns with the Defense Evasion technique T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
3. **Execution in Memory**: After decoding, the base64 blobs are executed in memory, which could involve Persistence or Defense Evasion techniques.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:
- **Initial Access** (to deliver the base64 blobs)
- **Deobfuscation/Decoding** (to make the base64 blobs executable)
- **Execution in Memory** (to drop and execute the KerrDown DLL)

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
