Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Longhorn's malware has already used commands for remote control and customized plugins for Collection.
   - The next step is to protect communications with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**: This is directly relevant as the question is about protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the use of HTTPS.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**: This is not directly related to the question as it pertains to data exfiltration rather than protecting C&C communications.
   - **Technique: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique is also related to exfiltration and not to protecting C&C communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which is not directly related to protecting C&C communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic directly involves the communication between the malware and the C&C server, which is the focus of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information, which is not directly related to protecting C&C communications.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which is already mentioned in the question and not the next step in protecting C&C communications.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is about protecting communications with C&C servers, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.
   - The related TTPs mention techniques for using web protocols (HTTPS) for C2, which aligns with the question's requirement for a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.
   - None of the other answer choices (Lateral Movement, Reconnaissance, or Collection) are directly related to protecting C&C communications.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
