Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Gaining credentials through phishing sites mimicking Instagram's interface.
2. Changing account passwords.
3. Downloading all content from the compromised accounts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement (T1534-Internal Spearphishing)**: This suggests that the attackers might have used spearphishing to move laterally within the network.
- **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials)**: This indicates that the attackers were gathering credentials, which aligns with the phishing activity mentioned in the question.
- **Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping)**: This technique involves accessing credentials, which is relevant to the phishing activity described.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
  - This TTP involves accessing credentials, which aligns with the phishing activity described in the question.
  - However, the question mentions that the attackers gained credentials through phishing, which is a form of initial access, not credential access.

- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
  - This TTP involves the initial entry into the target environment, which aligns with the phishing activity described.
  - Phishing is a common method of initial access, and the question explicitly mentions phishing sites.

- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
  - This TTP is not directly related to the actions described in the question. It involves developing resources, which is not a sequence of actions that follow the initial phishing activity.

- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - This TTP involves gathering information, which could include downloading content from the compromised accounts. However, it does not directly address the initial step of gaining credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions starting with gaining credentials through phishing.
- The related TTPs confirm that phishing is a form of initial access.
- The next steps (changing passwords and downloading content) are more aligned with actions that occur after initial access.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
