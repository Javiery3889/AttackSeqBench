Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by MuddyWater:
1. Leveraging decoy documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
2. Communicating with compromised servers to download files infected with macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing malicious files on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web page or other means that automatically downloads and executes malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1189-Drive-by Compromise)**: This is the initial step where the attacker gains access to the target system. However, the question already mentions leveraging decoy documents, which is a form of initial access.
- **Execution (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution and T1204.002-Malicious File)**: These techniques are directly related to the exploitation of the CVE-2017-0199 and the execution of malicious files (infected with macros).
- **Command and Control (C2) (T1071)**: This is the next logical step after initial access and execution, where the attacker communicates with the compromised system to download additional files.
- **Persistence (T1543)**: This is a tactic that ensures the attacker can maintain access to the system over time, which is a step that can occur after C2.
- **Exfiltration (T1041)**: This is the final step where the attacker extracts data from the compromised system, which is not mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: MuddyWater leverages decoy documents to gain initial access to the target system.
2. **Execution**: The decoy documents exploit CVE-2017-0199 and execute malicious files (infected with macros).
3. **Command and Control**: The attacker communicates with the compromised system to download additional files.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible next step after the initial access and execution is the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
