Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT10 gained Initial Access using DLL Side-Loading with `jjs.exe` and then established persistence using service installation and a Run registry key. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after gaining Initial Access but before establishing persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This technique is related to persistence, but it is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is directly related to the Initial Access method used by APT10, which is DLL Side-Loading with `jjs.exe`.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This is the first step in the sequence, not the step after Initial Access.
- **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This is not a tactic that occurs immediately after gaining Initial Access.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**: This is a tactic that can occur after gaining Initial Access, but it is not specifically about establishing persistence.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This is a tactic that can occur after gaining Initial Access, but it is not about establishing persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with Initial Access using DLL Side-Loading with `jjs.exe`.
- The next step in the sequence is establishing persistence, which is done using service installation and a Run registry key.
- The tactic that most likely occurred after gaining Initial Access but before establishing persistence is the execution of the payload or the malicious code that was delivered through the Initial Access method.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining Initial Access but before establishing persistence is Execution.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
