Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Stuxnet:
1. Rootkit functionality for hiding its presence.
2. Stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers for evasion.
3. Exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which aligns with the spread across networked systems.
- **Defense Evasion (T1553.002-Code Signing, T1014-Rootkit)**: These techniques are used to evade detection and hide the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is relevant to the rootkit and code signing techniques mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly address the spread across networked systems.
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is part of the overall attack but does not specifically address the spread across networked systems.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic directly addresses the spread across networked systems, which is a key part of the question. The exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities is a common method for lateral movement.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - This tactic involves establishing a channel for the attacker to control the malware, which is not the primary focus of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the spread of the malware across networked systems.
- The related TTPs mention lateral movement as a key tactic for moving within a network.
- The exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities is a common method for lateral movement.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
