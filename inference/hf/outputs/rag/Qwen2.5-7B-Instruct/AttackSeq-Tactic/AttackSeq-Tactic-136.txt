Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the utilization of `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the execution of the backdoor via `cmd.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**: This technique is about modifying the system's PATH environment variable to load malicious code before legitimate system files.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Execution**
  - Execution is a tactic that involves running code or scripts. While it is relevant to the final step of running the backdoor via `cmd.exe`, it does not necessarily precede the initial access or the persistence phase.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access is a tactic that involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. This is a logical precursor to any further actions, including persistence and execution.
- **Answer Choice C: Impact**
  - Impact is a broader term that encompasses the effects of the adversary's actions, such as data exfiltration or system damage. It is not a precursor to the execution of the backdoor.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
  - Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about the target. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly lead to the execution of the backdoor via `cmd.exe`.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the tactic in question should occur before the execution of the backdoor via `cmd.exe`.
- The related TTPs suggest that the initial access is a necessary step before any further actions, including persistence and execution.
- The technique T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking is a method of persistence, which would follow initial access.
- The technique T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is a method of execution, which would follow persistence.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Initial Access (Tactic: Initial Access) precedes the persistence and execution phases.

### Final Answer: B
