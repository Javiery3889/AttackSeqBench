Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with "ChChes gains initial access via malicious emails with disguised executable files." The next step in the sequence is the malware communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted HTTP requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves gaining initial access through a spearphishing link.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. It does not directly relate to the initial access or the communication with C&C servers.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. While it is relevant to the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly follow initial access or the communication with C&C servers.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to initially compromise a system. The question already mentions initial access via malicious emails, so this is not the next step.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system. While it is a step in the attack lifecycle, it does not directly follow the initial access or the communication with C&C servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with "ChChes gains initial access via malicious emails with disguised executable files." This is clearly described in the question.
- The next step is the malware communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted HTTP requests. This is a command and control activity.
- The related TTPs indicate that the technique for command and control is T1071.001-Web Protocols, which aligns with the encrypted HTTP requests mentioned in the question.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly follows initial access and leads to the command and control activity.

**Final Answer: D: Collection** (Although Collection is not the most direct next step, it is the only option that fits the given choices and the context of the question. The correct sequence would be Initial Access -> Execution -> Collection -> Command and Control, but Collection is the closest match among the given choices.)
