Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
1. The attack starts with evading detection through JavaScript obfuscation on compromised websites.
2. The Pupy backdoor then uses the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Defense Evasion (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information)**: These techniques involve evading detection and obfuscating files or information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The use of the obfs3 protocol for communication aligns with T1071.001-Web Protocols, which is a sub-technique under Command and Control.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. There is no mention of credential theft in the question, so this is less likely.
- **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data. While data collection might occur, the question focuses on the communication aspect, not the data collection itself.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves evading detection. While the question mentions evading detection through JavaScript obfuscation, the primary focus is on the communication aspect using the obfs3 protocol.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of the obfs3 protocol for communication, which is a technique under Command and Control.
- The evasive measures (JavaScript obfuscation) are part of the broader tactic of Defense Evasion, but the primary focus is on the communication aspect.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1071.001-Web Protocols is a sub-technique under Command and Control.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
