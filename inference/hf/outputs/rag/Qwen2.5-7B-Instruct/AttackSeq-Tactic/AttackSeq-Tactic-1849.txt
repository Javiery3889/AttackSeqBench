Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where BlueDelta (an attacker) collected emails by creating a filter in the Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward emails to an attacker-controlled address. This indicates that the attacker has already gained the ability to intercept and forward emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
  - This technique involves setting up a rule to forward emails to a different address, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**
  - This technique involves the attacker gaining access to email accounts, which is a prerequisite for setting up the forwarding rule.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to control and direct the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the email forwarding described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or gathering information about the target. This is also a potential subsequent step but not directly related to the email forwarding.
- **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the compromised system. Given that the attacker is already collecting emails and forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address, this is a logical next step.
- **Answer Choice D: Impact**
  - This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or disruption to the target system. While this could be a final step, it is not directly related to the email forwarding described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has already set up a rule to forward emails to an attacker-controlled address, which is a form of data collection.
- The next logical step would be to extract the collected data, as the attacker now has a means to gather emails.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after setting up the email forwarding rule is Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
