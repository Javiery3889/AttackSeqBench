Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malware was delivered to a logistics/shipping company through a compromised proprietary hardware/software scanner application, gaining initial access. The next step involves the malware identifying financial servers via automated attacks using SMB and RADMIN protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target organization.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web-based attack, such as a malicious website or drive-by download.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the malware began identifying financial servers via automated attacks using SMB and RADMIN protocols.

- **Impact (A)**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction, or disruption. It does not fit the sequence as it is a result rather than a step in the attack process.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the command and control (C2) relationship between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it is not the immediate step after initial access.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is important, it is not the immediate step after initial access.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources on the network. Given that the malware is now identifying financial servers via automated attacks using SMB and RADMIN protocols, this suggests the malware is actively discovering and classifying resources on the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware was delivered and gained initial access through a compromised proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
- The next step would be for the malware to identify and classify resources on the network, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- The malware then uses SMB and RADMIN protocols to target financial servers, which is a form of lateral movement.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware began with initial access and then moved to the Discovery tactic to identify financial servers.

**Final Answer: D**
