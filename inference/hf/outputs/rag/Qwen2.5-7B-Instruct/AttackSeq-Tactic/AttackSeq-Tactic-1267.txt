Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with TG1021 gaining initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - The next step is achieving persistence by utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target environment.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary's actions to maintain access to the target environment.
   - **Web Shell (Technique):** This technique involves the use of web shells to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question clearly states that the initial access was achieved through exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks. This aligns with the "Exploit Public-Facing Application" technique under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The next step is achieving persistence, which is described as using web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory. This aligns with the "Persistence" tactic and the "Web Shell" technique.

4. **Determine the Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before achieving persistence.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the initial access was through exploiting an application, and the persistence was achieved through web shells.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (Tactic) -> Persistence (Tactic)

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
- **A: Execution** - This is not a tactic and does not fit the sequence.
- **B: Credential Access** - This is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: Reconnaissance** - This is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **D: Initial Access** - This is the correct tactic that occurred before persistence.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
