Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Backdoor loaded an encrypted configuration file.
2. The configuration file was decrypted.
3. SSL protocol was used to connect to C&C servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation)**: This tactic involves the attacker using legitimate protocols or services to exfiltrate data or issue commands to the compromised system.
- **Defense Evasion (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File)**: This tactic involves the attacker using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This tactic is more about the communication with the C&C servers, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
  - The question does not indicate that the backdoor is impersonating a protocol or service to establish the initial connection, so this is less likely.

- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is about the encryption and decryption of the configuration file, which is a crucial step in the sequence.
  - The question mentions that the configuration file is encrypted and decrypted, which aligns with the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique.

- **Answer Choice C: Execution**
  - This tactic is about the execution of the backdoor and the encrypted configuration file, which is part of the sequence but not the initial step.
  - The question does not indicate that the backdoor is being executed, so this is less likely.

- **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
  - This tactic is about maintaining access to the system, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
  - The question does not indicate that the backdoor is establishing persistence, so this is less likely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves the encryption and decryption of a configuration file, which is a form of defense evasion.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the use of encrypted/encoded files, which aligns with the question's description.
- The command and control tactic is more about the final step of communication, not the initial steps of encryption and decryption.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
