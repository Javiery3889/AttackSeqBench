Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Shellbot gathers information about the infected host's processor details and monitoring tools.
2. The next step involves maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This does not align with the described sequence, as the focus is on maintaining communication and sending commands, not moving to other systems.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - Execution involves running malicious code or scripts. While this is part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the maintenance of communication through an IRC channel.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. The question mentions gathering information about the host's processor details and monitoring tools, which aligns with the T1082-System Information Discovery technique. However, this is the initial step and not the next step after maintaining communication.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) involves maintaining a channel for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The question explicitly mentions maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities, which aligns perfectly with the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Shellbot first gathers information (Discovery).
- The next step is to maintain communication (Command and Control) through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
