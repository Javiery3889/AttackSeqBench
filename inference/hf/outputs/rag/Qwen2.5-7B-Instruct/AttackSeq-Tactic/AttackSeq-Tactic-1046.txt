Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This is the primary tactic for gaining entry into a network.
- **Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content.
- **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique involves sending malicious attachments in spear-phishing emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Impact** - This tactic is about the effects of an attack, not the initial steps.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This is the tactic directly related to gaining entry into a network, which is the first step in the sequence described.
- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic is about gaining higher levels of access within the network, which happens after initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing the resources needed for an attack, which is a preparatory step but not the immediate step before gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. These are techniques under the **Initial Access** tactic.
- The sequence of events described in the question is: gaining initial access (through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks) -> delivering payloads via malicious files.
- The tactic that must occur before gaining initial access is the preparation and development of the means to gain that access.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the preparation and development of the means to gain initial access, which aligns with the **Resource Development** tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Resource Development
