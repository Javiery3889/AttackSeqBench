### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before cybercriminals developed and sold hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services, on the Chinese underground market.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's environment.
   - **Compromise Hardware Supply Chain (Technique T1195.003):** This technique involves compromising the supply chain to introduce malicious hardware.
   - **Resource Development (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker developing the resources needed for the attack, such as malware, tools, and infrastructure.
   - **Malware (Technique T1588.001 and T1587.001):** These techniques involve the development and use of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the development of resources, which logically precedes the development and sale of hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.
     - The related TTPs mention techniques for developing malware, which is a resource that can be used in the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - While reconnaissance is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs after initial access and before the development of hardware.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and control is a tactic that involves the attacker controlling the compromised system, which is a step that occurs after the initial access and resource development.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the theft of data, which is a step that occurs after the attacker has gained access and developed the necessary resources.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **Resource Development**. This is because it involves the development of the necessary resources (like malware) that would be used in the subsequent steps of the attack, including the development and sale of hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers.

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
