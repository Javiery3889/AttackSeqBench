Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that a BlackEnergy dropper established persistence through a LNK file in the system startup folder.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial persistence mechanism.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - T1547.009-Shortcut Modification (under Persistence tactic)
     - T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (under both Persistence and Privilege Escalation tactics)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question already mentions that persistence was established through a LNK file in the system startup folder, which aligns with T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder.
   - The question asks what happened after this persistence mechanism was established. Given the context, the next logical step would be to determine what the adversary does next in terms of their attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is about how the adversary initially gains access to the target environment. Since the question already mentions persistence, this is not the next step.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic is about maintaining access to the target environment. The question already states that persistence was established, so this is not the next step.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic is about how the adversary communicates with the compromised system. While this is a common next step after establishing persistence, it is not directly implied by the question.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic is about gathering data from the target environment. Given that persistence has been established, the next logical step would be to start collecting data, as the adversary now has a foothold in the system.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after establishing persistence through a LNK file in the system startup folder would be to start collecting data.
   - Final Answer: D: Collection
