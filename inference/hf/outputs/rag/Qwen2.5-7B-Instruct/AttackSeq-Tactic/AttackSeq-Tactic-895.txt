Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the initial access is gained through exploiting CVE-2017-11882, and then the system information is collected using POWERSHOWER. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after gaining initial access but before collecting system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP is relevant to the initial access via exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This TTP is relevant to the collection of system information using POWERSHOWER.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
  - This choice is not the most plausible because the question explicitly states that initial access has already been gained. The question is asking about the tactic that occurred after initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
  - This choice is the most plausible because it aligns with the technique T1082-System Information Discovery, which is used to collect system information after initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
  - This choice is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
  - This choice is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through exploiting CVE-2017-11882, which is covered by the T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution technique.
- The next step, which is before collecting system information, is the Discovery tactic, specifically using the T1082-System Information Discovery technique.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
