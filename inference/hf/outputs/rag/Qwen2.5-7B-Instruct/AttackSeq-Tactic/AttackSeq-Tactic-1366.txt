Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Scote malware uses multiple techniques to evade detection and then retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers. The key points are:
- Malware evasion
- Retrieval of information from external sources (Pastebin, Google+)
- Establishing communications with servers

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
- **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver (Technique)**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data or retrieve data from a remote location.
- **T1102-Web Service (Technique)**: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: Defense Evasion**: While the malware is evading detection, this tactic is not the primary focus of the question. The question is more about the communication and information retrieval process.
- **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While the malware might gather information, the question specifically mentions establishing communications and using external sources, which aligns more with Command and Control.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic directly involves the malware establishing and maintaining communications with its servers. The retrieval of information from external sources (Pastebin, Google+) and the use of web services to communicate with the servers are clear indicators of Command and Control.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. While the malware might exfiltrate data, the question focuses more on the initial communication and information retrieval process.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is using multiple techniques to evade detection, which is part of the broader attack lifecycle but not the primary focus of the question.
- The malware retrieves information from external sources (Pastebin, Google+) to establish communications with its servers.
- Establishing communications with servers is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
- The use of web services (T1102-Web Service) to communicate with the servers further supports the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
