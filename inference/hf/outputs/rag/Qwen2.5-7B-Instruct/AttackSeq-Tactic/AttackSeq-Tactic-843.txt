Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Longhorn gained initial access through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
2. The group conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the initial access and before the discovery operations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This tactic is about the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target network. The question already mentions that Longhorn gained initial access through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid being detected or investigated. While this could be relevant later in the attack lifecycle, it is not the immediate step after initial access.
- **Privilege Escalation (Tactic)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. This is typically a step after initial access and before discovery, but it is not the most immediate step.
- **Discovery (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary learning about the target's environment. The question states that the group conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations, which is the final step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with Initial Access, which is already covered by the related TTPs.
- The next step in the sequence is likely to be a tactic that involves the adversary taking control and understanding the environment, which is best described by the Discovery tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
