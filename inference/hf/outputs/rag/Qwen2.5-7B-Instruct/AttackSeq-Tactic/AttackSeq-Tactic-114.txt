Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Charming Kitten gained initial access to victims' accounts using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages impersonating Google Drive and other services.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic B)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions that Charming Kitten gained initial access using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages. This directly aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
- **Discovery (Tactic A)**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While discovery might occur after gaining initial access, it is not the first step in the sequence.
- **Persistence (Tactic C)**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's network or system. This is a step that occurs after initial access has been achieved.
- **Resource Development (Tactic D)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and preparing resources for an attack. This is a preparatory step that would occur before the initial access, but the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the initial access using spear-phishing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking for the tactic that occurred before the initial access using spear-phishing.
- The related TTPs clearly indicate that the Initial Access tactic is directly related to the spear-phishing technique.
- The other tactics (Discovery, Persistence, and Resource Development) do not fit the sequence as well as the Initial Access tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
