Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
2. Running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The related technique is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which aligns with exploiting CVE-2019-0604.
- **Execution (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary running code or commands on the target system. The related technique is T1059.003-Windows Command Shell, which aligns with running commands using the AntSword webshell.
- **Discovery (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to understand the network, system, and user environment. The related technique is T1033-System Owner/User Discovery, which aligns with discovering system and user information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, but the question specifies that the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells has already occurred. Therefore, Initial Access is not the correct answer.
- **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which is not directly mentioned in the question. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate next step after installing webshells.
- **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and users, which aligns with the question's mention of running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell.
- **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running commands, which is part of the question but not the final step. The question specifies that the commands are run for system and user discovery, which is a form of discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary has already exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
- The next step is running commands for system and user discovery, which is a form of Discovery.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Discovery.

**Final Answer: C**
