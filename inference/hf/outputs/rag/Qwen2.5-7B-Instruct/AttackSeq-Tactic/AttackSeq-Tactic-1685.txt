Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities where the adversary has already obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts. The next step is the discovery of Security Event logs using tools like PsLogList. We need to determine which tactic occurred before this discovery phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves analyzing Security Event logs, which aligns with the use of PsLogList.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the discovery phase.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves discovering processes on the system, which is also a form of discovery but not directly related to the use of PsLogList for Security Event logs.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is a common initial step in many attacks. However, the question specifies that the adversary has already obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts, so this is not the next step.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities. The use of PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs is a form of discovery, but we need to determine what happened before this.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets. While reconnaissance can be part of the initial phase, it is not as specific as the credential access or the direct use of tools like PsLogList.
- **Answer Choice D: Impact**: This tactic involves making changes to the system to achieve the adversary's goals, which is not the immediate step after obtaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The adversary has obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts.
- The next step is the use of tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs, which is a form of discovery.
- The most plausible tactic that occurred before the discovery phase is the act of obtaining credentials, as this is a common initial step in many attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
