Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Whitefly leveraged network mapping.
2. Infected further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
3. Exfiltrated large volumes of information over time.

We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial infection and before the exfiltration of data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Collection (Tactic):** This involves gathering data from the target environment.
- **Remote Data Staging (Technique T1074.002):** This is a sub-technique of data collection where data is prepared for exfiltration.
- **Impact (Tactic):** This involves causing harm or disruption to the target.
- **Application or System Exploitation (Technique T1499.004):** This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or systems.
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique T1041):** This involves exfiltrating data using a command and control channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining a presence on the target network to control and direct the attack.
  - It is more likely to occur after the initial infection and before exfiltration, as it is a means to manage the compromised systems and facilitate data exfiltration.

- **B: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures.
  - While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

- **C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network.
  - This is a step that occurs after initial infection but before the collection and exfiltration of data, making it a plausible candidate.

- **D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering data from the target environment.
  - This is a step that occurs after the initial infection and before exfiltration, making it a strong candidate.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Whitefly infects further computers and then exfiltrates data over time.
- The related TTPs indicate that the attack involves data collection and exfiltration.
- Lateral movement (C) is a necessary step to infect additional systems, which aligns with the sequence described.
- Collection (D) is the next logical step after infecting additional systems, as it involves gathering data from these systems.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial infection and before exfiltration is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
