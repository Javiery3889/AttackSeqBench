Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after collecting data from an infected iOS device, enabling communication with attackers and remote updates and module management.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves moving data or malware to other systems using removable media. However, this does not directly relate to the communication and management aspects mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system. While it is related to the initial data collection, it does not address the communication and management aspects.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the local system. While it is part of the initial phase, it does not address the communication and management aspects.
- **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It is not directly related to the communication and management aspects.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the establishment and maintenance of the interaction between an attacker and a compromised system. It directly addresses the communication and management of remote updates and module management.
- **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of resources to support the attacker's operations. It is not directly related to the communication and management aspects.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions enabling communication with attackers and remote updates and module management. This aligns most closely with the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which is specifically designed for maintaining interaction between attackers and compromised systems.
- The related TTPs do not provide additional context that would suggest a different tactic. The techniques mentioned (T1091 and T1005) are more about data movement and collection, not about the ongoing communication and management.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
