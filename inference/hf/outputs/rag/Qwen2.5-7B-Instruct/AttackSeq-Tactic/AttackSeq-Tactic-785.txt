Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group:
1. Delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
2. Activation of macros on victims' home computers.
3. Execution of malicious code using system utilities.
4. Use of a backdoor named CommsCacher.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred after the delivery of malicious documents and before the execution of malicious code and the use of a backdoor.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The delivery of malicious documents and the activation of macros are more about the initial access phase, but the question asks for what happened after this.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target's system. The execution of malicious code using system utilities fits this description.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials from the target. While this could be a step in the process, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary moving from one system to another within the target's network. This is not directly mentioned in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The delivery of malicious documents and the activation of macros are part of the Initial Access phase.
2. The execution of malicious code using system utilities is a clear step in the Execution phase.
3. The use of a backdoor named CommsCacher is also part of the Execution phase, but it is mentioned after the execution of the malicious code.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the delivery of malicious documents and the activation of macros, and before the execution of malicious code and the use of a backdoor, is the Execution phase.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
