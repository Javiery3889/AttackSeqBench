Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. A macro-enabled XLS file was delivered via phishing email.
2. A VB macro within the XLS file executed a malicious Windows Installer object.
3. The Windows Installer object downloaded an MSI package.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary's first step to establish a foothold in the target environment. The delivery of a macro-enabled XLS file via phishing email is a form of initial access.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target system. The execution of the VB macro within the XLS file is a clear example of execution.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials from the target system. There is no mention of credential access in the sequence described.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary moving from one system to another within the target network. There is no indication of lateral movement in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The delivery of the macro-enabled XLS file via phishing email is an initial access.
2. The execution of the VB macro within the XLS file is the next step, which aligns with the Execution tactic.
3. The execution of the VB macro leads to the download of the MSI package, which is a subsequent action.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (A) - to deliver the macro-enabled XLS file.
- Execution (B) - to execute the VB macro within the XLS file.

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial access and before the execution of the VB macro is Execution.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
