Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the tactic that most likely involved the gathering of email addresses and information to target specific individuals or organizations before the Sayad malware gained initial access through phishing emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gather information about the target to plan and execute an attack.
- **Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses** - This technique specifically involves the collection of email addresses.
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary's actions to introduce malware or other attack mechanisms into the target environment.
- **Technique: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves the use of phishing emails to deliver malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic is directly related to gathering information about the target, which includes collecting email addresses. The related technique T1589.002-Email Addresses supports this.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is more about what the adversary finds after gaining access rather than the initial gathering of information.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to develop and maintain the resources needed for the attack, which is not directly related to the initial gathering of information.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary's actions to run code or exploit vulnerabilities, which is the final step after gaining access, not the initial gathering of information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the tactic that involves gathering email addresses and information before the malware gains initial access.
- The related TTPs clearly indicate that the tactic of "Reconnaissance" is the most relevant, as it involves gathering information about the target, including email addresses.
- The technique T1589.002-Email Addresses further supports this by specifically mentioning the collection of email addresses.

### Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
