Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers modified a website to host malicious JavaScript files, leading to malware downloads on visitor devices. This indicates a sequence of actions that involve initial access to the website and the execution of the malicious code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by attack, which aligns with the scenario where the website is modified to host malicious content.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves executing code through a web browser, which is consistent with the scenario where malicious JavaScript files are downloaded and executed on visitor devices.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. While it might be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial compromise and execution of the malicious code.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic is directly related to the compromise of the website and the initial access to the system through the drive-by attack. This aligns well with the scenario described.
- **Answer Choice C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the compromised system. While it might be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial compromise and execution of the malicious code.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. This aligns with the scenario where the malicious JavaScript files are downloaded and executed on visitor devices.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes a drive-by attack where a website is modified to host malicious JavaScript files, leading to malware downloads on visitor devices.
- The related TTPs indicate that the initial compromise (Initial Access) and the execution of the malicious code (Execution) are the relevant tactics.
- The sequence of TTPs should start with the initial access to the system and then proceed to the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
