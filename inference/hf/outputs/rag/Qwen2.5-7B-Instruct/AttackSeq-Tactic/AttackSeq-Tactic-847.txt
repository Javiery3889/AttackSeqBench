Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This indicates that the malware is establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware is communicating with C&C servers.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2.
- **Exfiltration**: The malware might also be used to exfiltrate data.
- **T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted protocol that is not a C2 channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources. It does not fit the scenario of communication with C&C servers.
- **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target to an external location. While the question mentions a custom cryptographic protocol, it does not explicitly state that the data is being exfiltrated at this point.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network. The question does not mention any movement within the network.
- **D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target. The question clearly states that the malware is communicating with C&C servers, which aligns with the C2 tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is communicating with C&C servers, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- The use of a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification is a technique (T1071.001) under the C2 tactic.
- The question does not provide information that suggests the malware is moving laterally, discovering resources, or exfiltrating data at this point.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
