Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Impersonated login pages are used to collect credentials.
2. A redirection to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link occurs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target network. It does not directly relate to the initial steps of credential collection or redirection.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
  - This tactic involves gathering information to be used in an attack. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the use of impersonated login pages or the redirection to a YouTube clip.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
  - This tactic involves obtaining credentials. The question explicitly mentions the use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials, which aligns directly with this tactic.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the use of impersonated login pages or the redirection to a YouTube clip.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials, which is a clear indication of the **Credential Access** tactic.
- The redirection to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link is a technique used to maintain the attacker's presence or to further deceive the victim, which is more aligned with the **Command and Control** tactic, but not the initial step of credential collection.
- The related TTPs mention spearphishing links, which are consistent with the use of impersonated login pages and suspicious links.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: C
