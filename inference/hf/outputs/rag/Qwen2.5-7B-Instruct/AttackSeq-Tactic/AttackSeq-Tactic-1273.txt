Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. SharpHound is used for scanning and mapping targets during the Discovery phase.
2. TG1021 establishes command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Discovery Tactic**: This includes techniques like T1057-Process Discovery.
- **Persistence Tactic**: This includes techniques like T1505.004-IIS Components.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurred before TG1021 established command and control.

- **Discovery (A)**: This is the initial phase where SharpHound is used to scan and map targets. This is a prerequisite for any further actions.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target system. While it is necessary, it is not directly mentioned in the question and does not fit the sequence as well as Discovery.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This involves moving from one system to another. It is not directly related to the initial scanning and mapping phase.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This is the tactic where TG1021 establishes C2 by deploying an inline hook. This is the final step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery (A)**: SharpHound is used to scan and map targets, which is part of the Discovery phase.
2. **Persistence (T1505.004-IIS Components)**: This is a technique under the Persistence tactic, which is relevant to establishing C2.
3. **Command and Control (D)**: TG1021 establishes C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Discovery (A) occurred before TG1021 established command and control (D).

### Final Answer: A
