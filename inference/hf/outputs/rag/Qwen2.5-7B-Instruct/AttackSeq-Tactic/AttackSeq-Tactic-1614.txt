Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations from compromised systems. This indicates that the tactic in question should be one that precedes the gathering of information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves the attacker discovering local accounts on the system.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering system services on the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means of communication with the compromised system. It typically occurs after the initial access and is used to maintain control over the system. It does not fit the sequence before gathering information.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker taking steps to avoid being detected or investigated. While it can occur at various stages, it is not directly related to the gathering of information.
- **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target environment. This aligns well with the question as it directly precedes the gathering of information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly precede the gathering of information in the context of the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking for the tactic that occurs before the gathering of information.
- The related TTPs mention techniques under the Discovery tactic, which is a subset of the Reconnaissance Tactic.
- The techniques T1087.001-Local Account and T1007-System Service Discovery are both under the Discovery Tactic, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- The gathering of information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations is a form of reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
