Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Executing a PowerShell script that bypassed AMSI.
2. Creating registry keys.
3. Dropping script and batch files for system-level actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves techniques to avoid detection by blocking indicators. While this is relevant, it doesn't directly describe the sequence of actions.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute code. This is directly related to the first action in the sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: While this tactic is relevant, it is more about avoiding detection rather than the sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. Creating registry keys and dropping files are actions that can be used to establish persistence.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This tactic involves the process of running code or scripts. Executing the PowerShell script is the first action in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence starts with executing a PowerShell script (T1059.001-PowerShell).
2. The next action is creating registry keys, which can be used for persistence (T1096-Registry).
3. Finally, dropping script and batch files for system-level actions (T1059.001-PowerShell and T1218-Scripting) is a method to maintain persistence and execute code.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Persistence, as it involves the actions of creating registry keys and dropping files for system-level actions.

### Final Answer: C
