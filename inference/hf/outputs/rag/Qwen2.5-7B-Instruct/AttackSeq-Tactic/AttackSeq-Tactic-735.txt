Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike on the network.
2. The attacker performed reconnaissance using a different infrastructure.
3. The attacker exfiltrated data using the SmartFTP Client.

We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the deployment of Cobalt Strike and reconnaissance but before the data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using scheduled transfers.
- **Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that could be used for further attacks. While it is a common step, it does not fit the sequence as it would occur before the deployment of Cobalt Strike and reconnaissance.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code or scripts. While it is a step in the attack chain, it does not fit the sequence as it would occur after the deployment of Cobalt Strike.
- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target network. It would occur before the deployment of Cobalt Strike and reconnaissance, so it does not fit the sequence.
- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to control the compromised system. It fits the sequence as it would occur after the deployment of Cobalt Strike and reconnaissance, and before the exfiltration of data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike (Execution).
- The attacker performed reconnaissance (likely part of Collection).
- The attacker established a command and control channel (Command and Control).
- The attacker exfiltrated data using SmartFTP Client (Exfiltration).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the deployment of Cobalt Strike and reconnaissance but before the exfiltration of data is Command and Control.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
