Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. FIN7 gained admin privileges using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
2. An action occurs after gaining admin privileges and before data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This is the tactic and technique related to data exfiltration.
- **Execution via PowerShell (T1059.001)**: This is the technique used to execute code using PowerShell.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurs after gaining admin privileges and before data exfiltration.

- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. While it is a plausible step, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after gaining admin privileges.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While it is a common step, it is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. While it can be part of the attack, it is not the immediate next step after gaining admin privileges.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems. After gaining admin privileges, the next logical step would be to discover the network and systems to identify valuable data to exfiltrate.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: FIN7 gains admin privileges using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
- **Step 2**: The next logical step is to discover the network and systems to identify valuable data.
- **Step 3**: Once valuable data is identified, the data is exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: D
