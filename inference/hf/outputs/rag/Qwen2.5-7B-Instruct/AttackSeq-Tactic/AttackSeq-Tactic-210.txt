Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where "Before Dropping Elephant" gained initial access to high-profile targets through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The focus is on targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website or web application to deliver malicious content to a user.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email to trick the user into clicking and executing the payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access** - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the adversary gains access to the target's network or system. The related TTPs mention both drive-by compromise and spear-phishing, which are methods of initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Impact** - This is a later stage where the adversary causes damage or achieves their objective. The question does not indicate that the impact has been achieved yet.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery** - This involves the adversary identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or gathering information about the target. While this is a step in the attack, it is not the first step.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance** - This involves gathering information about the target to plan the attack. This is also a step in the attack but not the first step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that the adversary gained initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. Both of these methods fall under the "Initial Access" tactic.
- The related TTPs confirm that "Initial Access" is the correct tactic, and the techniques mentioned (drive-by compromise and spear-phishing link) are valid methods for gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
