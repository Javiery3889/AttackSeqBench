Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Regin has executed its modules to perform tasks while avoiding detection. The next step in the sequence is to clean traces of its presence and blend in with the system’s memory pools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are all under the Tactic of "Defense Evasion":
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
- **T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the Rundll32 executable to execute code, which can be used to hide malicious activities.
- **T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This technique involves removing or disabling mechanisms that maintain persistence on the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, and using channels for command and control. It does not directly relate to cleaning traces of presence or blending in with the system’s memory pools.
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - This tactic involves the process of running malicious code or scripts. It does not directly relate to cleaning traces of presence or blending in with the system’s memory pools.
- **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic directly aligns with the question's requirement to clean traces of presence and blend in with the system’s memory pools. The related TTPs (T1070-Indicator Removal, T1218.011-Rundll32, T1070.009-Clear Persistence) all fall under this tactic.
- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to other systems. It does not directly relate to cleaning traces of presence or blending in with the system’s memory pools.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where Regin is actively avoiding detection and cleaning its traces.
- The related TTPs are all under the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
- The techniques mentioned (T1070-Indicator Removal, T1218.011-Rundll32, T1070.009-Clear Persistence) are all methods used to evade detection and clean traces.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
