Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. 'Surtr' ensures persistence by adding registry keys and storing C2 information.
2. This is followed by connecting to a command and control server to download a stage two component.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This is the final step in the sequence.
- **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique is related to the command and control aspect, indicating that the malware uses multiple stages to communicate with the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurs after persistence and before command and control.

- **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)**: This is the initial step where the malware ensures it can run on system restarts.
- **Command and Control (T1071)**: This is the final step where the malware connects to the C2 server.
- **Collection (T1033)**: This involves gathering data, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **Discovery (T1082)**: This involves identifying and classifying resources, which is also not directly related to the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The malware ensures persistence by adding registry keys and storing C2 information.
2. **Collection**: This step is not mentioned in the sequence and is not directly related to the described actions.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware connects to the C2 server to download a stage two component.

Given the sequence described in the question, the step that occurs after persistence and before command and control is likely to be data collection, as the malware needs to gather information before it can communicate with the C2 server.

However, since the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurs after persistence and before command and control, and given the related TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
