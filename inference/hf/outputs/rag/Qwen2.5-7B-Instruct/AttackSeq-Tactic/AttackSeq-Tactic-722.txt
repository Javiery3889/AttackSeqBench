Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT28 uses the Komplex Binder to deliver a dropper, which is then saved on the system and opened to initiate an attack. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution and the Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File. This indicates that the next step in the attack sequence involves executing a malicious file.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The question already describes the initial access (using Komplex Binder to deliver the dropper), so this is not the next step.
- **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running code or programs on the target system. The question states that the dropper is saved on the system and opened, which aligns with the execution of a malicious file.
- **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the immediate action of opening the dropper.
- **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network. This is a step that could occur after the initial execution of the dropper, but it is not the immediate next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described involves delivering a dropper using Komplex Binder and then saving and opening it.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the Execution tactic and the T1204.002-Malicious File technique, which directly aligns with the action of opening the dropper.
- Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is the Execution tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
