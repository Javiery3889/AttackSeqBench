Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where an email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment is sent to Susan. When the attachment is opened, a disguised executable file is executed. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the email was sent.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This indicates that the execution of a malicious file is a technique used in the attack.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This indicates that the initial access to the system was achieved through a spearphishing attachment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target's environment. The spearphishing attachment is a method of initial access, but the question asks what happened after the email was sent.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target's environment. It is not directly related to the immediate action after the email is opened.
- **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It is not directly related to the immediate action after the email is opened.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves running code or programs on the target's system. The execution of the disguised executable file is a clear example of this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The email with the PDF attachment is a method of initial access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
2. Opening the PDF attachment leads to the execution of a disguised executable file (T1204.002-Malicious File).
3. The execution of the malicious file is the immediate action that follows the initial access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the execution of the malicious file after the initial access.

**Final Answer: D**
