Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Deployment of `InstallUtil.exe` for defense evasion.
2. Injection of a malicious payload into memory.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next, based on the payload's communication pattern with an attacker-controlled server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic includes techniques like using `InstallUtil.exe` and `msiexec` for evasion.
- **Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting a malicious payload into memory.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. Given that the question mentions communication with an attacker-controlled server, this is a strong candidate.
  
- **B: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it could be a subsequent step, the question does not directly indicate a need for privilege escalation.
  
- **C: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. The question does not mention data exfiltration, so this is less likely.
  
- **D: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is already covered by the initial steps described in the question. The question asks for the next tactic, not the same one.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial steps involve defense evasion and process injection.
- The next logical step, given the communication with an attacker-controlled server, is Command and Control (C2). This aligns with the tactic of establishing a channel for further communication and control.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
