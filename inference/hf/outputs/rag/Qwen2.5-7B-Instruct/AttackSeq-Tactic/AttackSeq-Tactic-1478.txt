Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where the Duke group uses layered encryption and encoding to securely communicate with their command-and-control (C2) server. This indicates that the group has already established a secure channel for managing the compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using standard encoding methods to obfuscate data.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to secure communication.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the context of the question, the Duke group has already established a secure communication channel using layered encryption and encoding. The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to use this secure channel to manage the compromised systems.

- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a common step in an attack, it does not directly follow the secure communication setup described in the question.
- **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target system to the attacker. Again, while it is a common step, it does not directly follow the secure communication setup described.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems. This could be a step after establishing a secure C2 channel, but it is not the most direct next step.
- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. Since the question states that the group has securely communicated with their C2 server, the next step would be to use this channel to manage the compromised systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a secure communication channel established using layered encryption and encoding.
- The next logical step is to use this secure channel to manage the compromised systems.
- Among the given options, "Command and Control" (D) is the most appropriate tactic that follows the secure communication setup.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
