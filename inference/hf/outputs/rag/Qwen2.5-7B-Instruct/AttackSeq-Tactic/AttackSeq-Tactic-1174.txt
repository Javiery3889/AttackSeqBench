Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT28:
1. Scanned 8,536,272 IPs in Ukraine to identify 1,704,837 vulnerable systems.
2. Used spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to infect targets.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.002-Email Addresses**
  - This technique involves gathering email addresses for reconnaissance purposes.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves using spear phishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (Choice B)**
  - The scanning of IPs and identification of vulnerable systems aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic. This is the first step in the sequence.
- **Initial Access (Choice D)**
  - The use of spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to infect targets aligns with the Initial Access tactic. This is the second step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance (Choice B)**
   - APT28 scanned 8,536,272 IPs in Ukraine to identify 1,704,837 vulnerable systems. This action is a clear example of reconnaissance.
2. **Initial Access (Choice D)**
   - After identifying vulnerable systems, APT28 used spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to infect targets. This is a clear example of initial access.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Reconnaissance (Choice B)**
- **Initial Access (Choice D)**

### Final Answer: B and D
