Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor has established communication with its C2 server by sending information about current sessions on the system.
   - This indicates that the backdoor has already set up a communication channel with the C2 server and is now sending data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying information about the target's environment.
   - **Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target's systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The backdoor has already established communication with the C2 server, so this is a prerequisite for further actions.
   - **Discovery:** While the backdoor is sending information about current sessions, this is more about gathering information rather than the next step in the attack sequence.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. The question does not mention moving to another system, so this is less likely.
   - **Exfiltration:** This involves stealing data. The question mentions sending information about current sessions, which could be a precursor to exfiltration, but it is not explicitly stated that data is being stolen at this point.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor has established communication with the C2 server.
   - The next logical step would be to use this communication channel to gather more information or to perform further actions.
   - Discovery (T1049) is about gathering information, which aligns with the backdoor sending information about current sessions.
   - Lateral Movement (T1074) involves moving to another system, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - Exfiltration (T1041) involves stealing data, which is a step that could follow gathering information but is not explicitly mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
