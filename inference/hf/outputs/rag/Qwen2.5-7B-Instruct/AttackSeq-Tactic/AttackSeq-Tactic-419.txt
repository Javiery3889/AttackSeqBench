Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports and tricked developers into pulling and running malicious container images. This implies that the attackers had to first gain some level of reconnaissance or information about the misconfigured Docker API ports and then use this information to execute their attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which is relevant to the final step of the attack (running the malicious container image).
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1612-Build Image on Host**: This technique involves building a malicious image on the host, which is also relevant to the final step of the attack.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL, which is another form of defense evasion but not directly related to the Docker API or container images.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the attack sequence described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This tactic is more about the consequences of the attack rather than the steps leading up to it.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in an attack. The question implies that the attackers needed to know about the misconfigured Docker API ports, which aligns with reconnaissance.
- **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the misconfigured Docker API or the tricking of developers into running malicious container images.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers needed to gather information about the misconfigured Docker API ports, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- After gathering this information, they could then exploit the misconfigured API to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
- The techniques T1204.002-Malicious File and T1612-Build Image on Host are relevant to the final step of the attack but not the initial reconnaissance phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the exploitation of the misconfigured Docker API and the tricking of developers into running malicious container images is reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
