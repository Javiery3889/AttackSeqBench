Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where ScarCruft used phishing emails containing Office documents to compromise host systems and load further malicious scripts using Office Macros. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This indicates that the malicious script loaded by the Office document is executed on the host system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This describes the method used to gain initial access to the host system via a phishing email.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. It typically occurs after initial access and execution of malware.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment, which has already been described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**: This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. The question states that the malicious script was loaded and executed, so this is a direct result of the initial compromise.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. It usually follows the execution of malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that ScarCruft used phishing emails to gain initial access to the host system.
2. **Execution**: After gaining access, the Office document was used to load and execute malicious scripts on the host system.
3. **Lateral Movement and Command and Control**: These tactics are more likely to occur after the initial execution of the malware, as they involve further actions within the network.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after the initial compromise and execution of the malicious script would be to establish a means of communication with the attacker, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
