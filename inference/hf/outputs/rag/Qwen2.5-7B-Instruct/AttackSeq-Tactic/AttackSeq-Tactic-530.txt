Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely involved creating a fraudulent website to trick users and facilitate further stages of the attack.
   - The sequence of events described is that Tortoiseshell gained initial access through a fake veteran hiring website.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the Initial Access tactic:
     - T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, which can be facilitated by a malicious website.
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link: This technique involves sending a malicious link to a specific individual or group, which can also lead to initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question specifically mentions a fraudulent website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com) being used to trick users.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise directly involves a malicious website, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link involves a link, not a website, so it is less directly relevant to the creation of a fraudulent website.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is T1189-Drive-by Compromise, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.

Final Answer: A: Initial Access
