Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where "vba_macro.exe" is executed via the Shell command, and the BlackEnergy dropper is ensured to be executed on every system startup. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensured this persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification**: This technique involves modifying shell configuration files to ensure that malicious code is executed at every system startup.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute code, which aligns with the "vba_macro.exe" mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information to better understand the target. It does not directly relate to ensuring persistence at system startup.
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. It does not directly relate to ensuring persistence at system startup.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system. It does not directly relate to ensuring persistence at system startup.
- **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. The related TTP "T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification" directly aligns with ensuring that the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where "vba_macro.exe" is executed, and the BlackEnergy dropper is ensured to be executed on every system startup.
- The related TTP "T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification" is specifically about ensuring that malicious code is executed at every system startup, which aligns perfectly with the persistence tactic.
- The other answer choices do not directly relate to ensuring persistence at system startup.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
