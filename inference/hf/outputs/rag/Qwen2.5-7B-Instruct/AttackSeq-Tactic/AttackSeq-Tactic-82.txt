Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that ALLANITE employed malware to take screenshots of the target systems and conducted surveys during their collection activities. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Collection and the Technique: T1113-Screen Capture. This indicates that the malware used by ALLANITE was primarily focused on collecting information through screen captures.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining long-term presence within a network. While it is a common tactic after initial access, it is not directly related to the specific actions of taking screenshots and conducting surveys.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials to gain access to systems. While it is a common follow-up to initial access, it is not directly related to the specific actions of taking screenshots and conducting surveys.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources needed to conduct an attack. It is more about the preparation and development of tools and techniques rather than the immediate actions of taking screenshots and conducting surveys.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker initially gaining access to the target environment. While it is the first step, the question is asking what happened after the collection activities, not the initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of malware to take screenshots and conduct surveys, which are part of the Collection tactic.
- After collecting this information, the next logical step would be to use the collected data, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic (using the collected credentials) or the Persistence tactic (maintaining access using the collected information).
- However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the collection activities, and the most direct and logical follow-up to collecting information is to use that information to gain further access or maintain access.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is moving from Collection to Credential Access.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
