Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Trickbot gathers credentials and application information.
2. Uses psfin32 and shadnewdll modules for PoS data extraction.
3. Modifies web traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
  - Technique: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie
  - Technique: T1552.001-Credentials In Files
  - Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic is more about gathering data, which is already described in the question as Trickbot gathering credentials and application information.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining the adversary's control over the compromised system, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials, which is the first step in the sequence described.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access (C)**: Trickbot gathers credentials and application information, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.
2. **Data Collection (Collection, A)**: Gathering credentials and application information is a form of data collection.
3. **Data Exfiltration or Use (Command and Control, B)**: Using psfin32 and shadnewdll modules for PoS data extraction and modifying web traffic suggests that the data is being used or exfiltrated, which aligns with Command and Control.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Credential Access (C)**: Gathering credentials and application information.
- **Collection (A)**: Gathering the data.
- **Command and Control (B)**: Using the data for PoS data extraction and modifying web traffic.

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial steps is **Command and Control (B)**.

Final Answer: B
