Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection.
2. An unknown TTP occurred after this.
3. TG1021 then used publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves interfering with logging mechanisms to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network. It doesn't fit the sequence as it comes after the reconnaissance phase.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. It doesn't fit the sequence as it is more about gaining access rather than reconnaissance.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. It fits well as it comes after evading detection and before reconnaissance.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network. It doesn't fit the sequence as it comes after the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion)** to evade detection.
2. The next step would be to gather information about the network and systems (T1018-Remote System Discovery) to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
3. After gathering this information, TG1021 would then use tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C
