Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Bankshot implant was executed by downloading and running a DLL implant from a malicious domain.
2. The next step is evading detection by wiping files and content from the targeted system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion)**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection.
- **Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001)**: This technique involves injecting a DLL into a process to gain control or execute code.
- **Persistence (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking)**: This technique involves modifying the search order of DLLs to ensure persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the execution of the DLL implant but before the wiping of files and content.

- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running malicious code. The question states that the Bankshot implant was executed, so this is a prerequisite but not the next step.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves ensuring the malware remains on the system. The wiping of files and content (Defense Evasion) is a step that follows persistence, as it is a method to evade detection after the malware has established persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Bankshot implant was executed, which is a prerequisite for the next steps.
- The next step is likely to be establishing persistence, which can be done through techniques like DLL search order hijacking (T1574.001).
- After persistence is established, the malware would then attempt to evade detection by wiping files and content (T1070.004-File Deletion).

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the execution of the DLL implant but before the wiping of files and content is Persistence.

### Final Answer: D
