Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a malicious app is delivered to victims via a website disguised as a fundraising service. This indicates that the attackers used a method to initially gain access to the victims' systems and then delivered a payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using a link to execute a malicious payload. This aligns with the scenario where a website (disguised as a fundraising service) delivers a malicious app.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a drive-by download, where a user visits a malicious website and gets infected without any user interaction beyond visiting the site.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malicious app.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing and maintaining the interaction between systems to deliver commands and retrieve data. This is more likely to occur after the initial access and payload delivery.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the techniques used to initially gain access to the target environment. The scenario described aligns well with this tactic, as the website disguised as a fundraising service is a method of initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attackers developing and maintaining the resources they use for their operations. This is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malicious app.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The scenario describes a website disguised as a fundraising service delivering a malicious app, which aligns with the technique T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
2. The initial access is the first step in the attack sequence, which is described in the question.
3. After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely use the malicious app to further their objectives, which could involve command and control.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the initial access followed by the execution of the malicious payload.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
