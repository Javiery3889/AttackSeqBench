Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after configuring the command-and-control infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server, the next step in the attack sequence is to be identified. The options provided are:
- A: Lateral Movement
- B: Command and Control
- C: Credential Access
- D: Exfiltration

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090-Proxy**: This indicates that the infrastructure for command and control is being set up using a proxy.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This further specifies the use of a multi-hop proxy, which is a more advanced form of proxying traffic through multiple compromised systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems. While this is a common step in many attacks, it does not directly follow the setup of a command-and-control infrastructure.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the interaction between an attacker and compromised systems. Given that the infrastructure has already been configured using a compromised router as a proxy, the next logical step would be to use this infrastructure to control and interact with the compromised systems.
- **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this is a common step, it is more likely to occur before or during the setup of the command-and-control infrastructure.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. While this is a critical step, it typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and has control over the system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the setup of a command-and-control infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server.
- The related TTPs mention the use of a multi-hop proxy, which is a method of maintaining command and control over compromised systems.
- Given that the infrastructure has been set up, the next logical step would be to use this infrastructure to control and interact with the compromised systems, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
