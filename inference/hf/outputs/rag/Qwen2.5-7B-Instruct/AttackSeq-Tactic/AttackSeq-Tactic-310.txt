Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Malicious documents execute VBA macros to deliver first-stage payloads.
2. This is followed by ensuring persistence through Windows registry entries.
3. Finally, reconnaissance is performed on victim computers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
  - This is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
  - However, the question asks about the TTP that occurs after the first-stage payload delivery, which is not the final step.

- **Answer Choice B: Collection**
  - This is not directly mentioned in the sequence described in the question.
  - Collection typically involves gathering data, which is not the immediate next step after ensuring persistence.

- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
  - This is the first step in the sequence described in the question.
  - Initial access involves the delivery of the first-stage payload, which is the step immediately before ensuring persistence and performing reconnaissance.

- **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
  - This is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
  - Exfiltration involves the removal of data from the victim's network, which is not the immediate next step after ensuring persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question starts with the delivery of the first-stage payload through VBA macros.
- The next step in the sequence is ensuring persistence through Windows registry entries.
- The final step in the sequence is performing reconnaissance on the victim computers.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the TTP that occurs immediately after the first-stage payload delivery (VBA macros) is "Initial Access."

### Final Answer: C
