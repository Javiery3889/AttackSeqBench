Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Kingslayer gained access through a supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software and then configured a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.
   - We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial access but before the configuration of the diurnal beaconing algorithm.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" and "Supply Chain Compromise" as techniques under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - This confirms that the supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software falls under the "Initial Access" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves the theft of credentials. While it could be a step after gaining initial access, it is not directly related to the supply-chain compromise mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves the gathering of data. It is a logical step after gaining access and before configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the first step (supply-chain compromise). Therefore, it cannot be the next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. It is mentioned as the final step in the question, not the step after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The supply-chain compromise (T1195.002) is the initial access.
   - After gaining access, the next logical step would be to collect data or information, which is a common activity after gaining access to a system.
   - Configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection is a step that would come after collecting data to understand the environment and gather information.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through the supply-chain compromise, the next step would be to collect data.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: B: Collection"
