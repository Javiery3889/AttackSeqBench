Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware scanned for files and prepared data containing paths of all files to be exfiltrated.
2. Communication from the infected system to the attacker using ports 80 or 443.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
  - Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port
- **Tactic: Exfiltration**
  - Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the malware scanning and preparing data for exfiltration fits this, it does not directly address the communication aspect using ports 80 or 443.
- **Privilege Escalation (B)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It does not directly relate to the communication aspect using ports 80 or 443.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing resources to support the attack. It does not directly address the communication aspect using ports 80 or 443.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The related TTPs mention using non-standard ports (80 or 443) for communication, which aligns with the question's description of communication using these ports.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already collected and prepared data for exfiltration.
- The next step is to establish communication with the attacker.
- The related TTPs specifically mention Command and Control (C2) and the use of non-standard ports (80 or 443) for communication.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Command and Control (C2) to enable communication from the infected system to the attacker using ports 80 or 443.

**Final Answer: D**
