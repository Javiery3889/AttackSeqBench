Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking in a legitimate application.
2. The attackers then stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about the initial entry into the target network. The question already mentions that ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking, which is a method of initial access. Therefore, this is not the correct sequence.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the network. The question states that the attackers stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network, which is a form of persistence.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic is about stealing credentials. The question mentions that the attackers stole domain authentication credentials, which fits this tactic.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic is about running code or scripts. While ShadowPad was executed, this is not the final step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking, which is a method of initial access.
2. **Execution**: ShadowPad was executed, but this is not the final step in the sequence.
3. **Credential Access**: The attackers stole domain authentication credentials, which is a form of credential access.
4. **Persistence**: After stealing credentials, the attackers used them to propagate further within the network, which is a form of persistence.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- ShadowPad was executed (Execution).
- The attackers stole domain authentication credentials (Credential Access).
- The attackers used the stolen credentials to propagate further within the network (Persistence).

Therefore, the final answer is: **Final Answer: C**
