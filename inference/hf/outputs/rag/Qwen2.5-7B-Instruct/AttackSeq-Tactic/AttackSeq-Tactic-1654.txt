Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attackers' batch file initiates a PowerShell script to download and load malicious components in memory. We need to identify which tactic most likely occurred before this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using a command shell to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including executing a batch file or PowerShell script.
- **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance can provide valuable information, it is not a direct prerequisite for executing a batch file or PowerShell script.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing tools and resources to be used in the attack. This is more about the preparation phase and not directly related to the execution of a batch file or PowerShell script.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing channels to exfiltrate data or send commands to the compromised system. This is more about maintaining control after the initial access and is not a direct prerequisite for executing a batch file or PowerShell script.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves the execution of a batch file and a PowerShell script. For these actions to occur, the attackers must first gain access to the target environment.
- The related TTPs mention the use of a command shell and PowerShell, which are techniques under the Execution tactic. However, these techniques are a result of the initial access, not the cause.
- Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the execution of the batch file and PowerShell script is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A**
