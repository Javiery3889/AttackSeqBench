Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Embedded malware is delivered in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
2. An automated attack using the SMB protocol is targeted at servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using SMB shares for lateral movement, which aligns with the use of the SMB protocol in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves executing Visual Basic scripts, which could be part of the malware delivery or execution phase.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding payloads in legitimate files or applications, which aligns with the delivery of embedded malware in the scanner application.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which TTP occurs after the delivery of the embedded malware and before the automated attack using the SMB protocol.

- **Answer Choice A: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the target system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial compromise of the target system. While it is part of the attack sequence, it occurs before the delivery of the embedded malware.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution** - This tactic involves running code on the target system. It logically follows the delivery of the embedded malware and precedes the use of the SMB protocol for an automated attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The embedded malware is delivered in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
- The malware must be executed on the target system to perform its malicious actions.
- After execution, the malware can then use the SMB protocol to target servers for an automated attack.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware is executed after its delivery and before the automated attack using the SMB protocol.

**Final Answer: D**
