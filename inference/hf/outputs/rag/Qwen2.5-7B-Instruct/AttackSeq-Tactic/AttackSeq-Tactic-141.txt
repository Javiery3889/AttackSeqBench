Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where SparrowDoor:
1. Obtained credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.
2. Collected system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
3. Read file contents for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information and assets.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system.
- **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System)**: This technique aligns with the action of reading file contents for exfiltration, which is a form of data collection.
- **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery)**: This technique aligns with the action of collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types, which is a form of discovery.

Given the sequence of actions:
1. SparrowDoor obtained credentials (Initial Access).
2. Collected system information (Discovery).
3. Read file contents for exfiltration (Collection).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred when SparrowDoor collected system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
- The related TTPs indicate that the technique T1082-System Information Discovery is specifically for gathering information about the system, which matches the action described in the question.
- The tactic "Collection" (T1005-Data from Local System) is more aligned with the final step of reading file contents for exfiltration, not the initial collection of system information.

Therefore, the most plausible tactic for the described action is "Discovery."

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
