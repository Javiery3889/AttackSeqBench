Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download resources. After this, GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are activated on the compromised system. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the initial communication and resource download.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates that the PowerShell script was used to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This suggests that tools (like the ransomware and malware) were transferred to the system via C2 servers.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This tactic is about maintaining control over the target system through C2 channels. While the initial communication with C2 servers is part of this tactic, the activation of malware is not directly under the Command and Control tactic.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target system. The question does not mention any data being stolen, so this is unlikely.
- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges, so this is unlikely.
- **Answer Choice D: Impact**
  - This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the malware. The activation of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware directly causes impact by encrypting files and stealing data, respectively.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial communication with C2 servers and the download of resources are part of the Command and Control tactic.
- The activation of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware is the direct result of the resources being downloaded, which causes significant impact to the system.
- Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial communication and resource download is the one that describes the impact caused by the malware.

**Final Answer: D: Impact**
