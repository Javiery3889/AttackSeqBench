Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where malware has already scanned for files matching specific extensions and staged data on the victim's system.
   - The next step in the sequence is to send the prepared data to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Collection Tactic:**
     - **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves the malware staging data on the victim's system.
     - **T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the malware collecting data automatically.
   - **Exfiltration Tactic:**
     - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question is asking about the next step after data staging, which logically leads to the exfiltration of that data.
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration** - This aligns with the next logical step after data staging, as it involves sending the prepared data to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection** - This is the initial step of gathering data, not the exfiltration of that data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This is a tactic, not a specific technique for exfiltrating data.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to exfiltrate the prepared data to the C&C server after the data has been staged.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
