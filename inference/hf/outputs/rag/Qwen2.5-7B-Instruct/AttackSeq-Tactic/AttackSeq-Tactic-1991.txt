Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus group:
1. Gained initial access through malicious Word documents with macros.
2. Executed the next stage of the attack.
3. Achieved persistence by auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic is about the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target environment. The question mentions gaining initial access through malicious Word documents, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target system. The question states that the next stage of the attack was executed, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic is about the adversary maintaining access to the target system over time. The question mentions achieving persistence by auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access (C)**: The question starts with the group gaining initial access through malicious Word documents, which is a form of initial access.
2. **Execution (A)**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to execute the next stage of the attack, which is a form of execution.
3. **Persistence (D)**: Finally, the group achieves persistence by auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware, which is a form of persistence.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (C) -> Execution (A) -> Persistence (D)

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: A (Execution)
