Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities including discovery and reconnaissance using tools like NetBIOS scanners and built-in networking utilities.
   - The next step is to enable the threat actor to control infected systems using Dropbox as an intermediary.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques for remote system discovery (T1018) and network service discovery (T1046), which align with the initial discovery activities described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic is already completed as per the question, as the initial activities are described as discovery and reconnaissance.
   - **Persistence (B):** While persistence is a common tactic after gaining access, it is not directly related to the use of Dropbox as an intermediary for control.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While this might be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the use of Dropbox for control.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, and using channels for the remote control of a system. Using Dropbox as an intermediary to control infected systems fits this description well.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial activities (NetBIOS scanning and network service discovery) fall under the Discovery tactic.
   - The next step, which involves using Dropbox to control infected systems, aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
