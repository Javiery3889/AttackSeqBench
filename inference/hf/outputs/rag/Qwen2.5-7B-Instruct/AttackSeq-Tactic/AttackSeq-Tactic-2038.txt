Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails and execution of a Trojan backdoor through trusted software.
2. The next step in the sequence is the use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain access to the victim networks.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: T1566-Phishing
- **Lateral Movement**: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the use of RDP to maintain access. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access or permissions. While it could be a step in maintaining access, it is not directly related to the use of RDP.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the network. It could be a step before using RDP to understand the network layout and identify targets.
- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network over time. Using RDP to maintain access is a form of persistence.

### Step 3: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used spear-phishing and a Trojan backdoor to gain initial access.
2. **Discovery**: After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to understand the network environment to identify valuable targets and resources.
3. **Persistence**: Once they have discovered valuable targets, they would use RDP to maintain access to the network.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used the **Discovery** tactic to understand the network environment before using RDP to maintain access.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
