Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by VERMIN malware:
1. Gathering information such as machine name, OS name, architecture, local IP address.
2. Detecting anti-virus software via WMI query.
3. Communicating with its servers using SOAP envelopes and the WSHttpBinding() API.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as system details, network topology, and user information. The actions described in the question (gathering machine name, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and detecting anti-virus software) align closely with this tactic.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the ability to direct an adversary's access to and use of compromised resources. While the malware is communicating with its servers, this is more about the communication aspect rather than the initial discovery phase.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The question does not indicate any actions that suggest the malware is setting up long-term persistence.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While the malware is gathering information, the primary focus of the question is on the initial discovery phase rather than the collection of data for long-term use.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware is gathering specific information about the target system, which is a clear indication of the Discovery tactic.
2. The communication with the server using SOAP envelopes and WSHttpBinding() API is a method of establishing a Command and Control channel, but the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred during the initial phase of gathering information.
3. The related TTPs explicitly mention the Discovery tactic and the System Information Discovery technique, which aligns perfectly with the actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
