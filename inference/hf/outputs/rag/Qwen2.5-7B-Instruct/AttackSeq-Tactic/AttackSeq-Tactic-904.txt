Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
- WinDealer established execution by decoding an embedded DLL file.
- The decoding uses a 10-byte XOR key.
- The logic is divided between the EXE and companion DLL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding payloads within other files to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the described execution and decoding process. It involves the development of tools, resources, or infrastructure, which does not align with the given scenario.

- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the execution and decoding process described in the question.

- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts. The question explicitly states that WinDealer established execution by decoding an embedded DLL file. Therefore, this is the immediate next step after the decoding process.

- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the execution and decoding process described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the establishment of execution through decoding an embedded DLL file.
- The related TTPs confirm that the technique used (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The immediate next step after establishing execution is the execution itself.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
