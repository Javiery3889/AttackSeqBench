Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tickusb avoids detection by altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs and only running when specific files are executed. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred when the DLL file was triggered to carry out malicious activities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading)**
  - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection. This aligns with the question's description of altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs and avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Persistence (T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking)**
  - This technique involves modifying the search order of DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This is more about ensuring the malicious DLL is loaded when a specific file is executed, which is part of the sequence but not the initial tactic that leads to the execution of the malicious activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the tactic that occurred when the DLL file was triggered to carry out malicious activities. The initial tactic that leads to the loading of the malicious DLL is more aligned with **Defense Evasion**.
- **Defense Evasion** (T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading) is the tactic that involves the initial loading of the malicious DLL into a legitimate process to avoid detection. This is the first step in the sequence before the DLL is triggered to carry out malicious activities.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
