Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the BlackEnergy2 (BE2) group used malicious plugins for destructive operations and backup communication.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic involves detailed gathering of system information before performing impactful actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1082-System Information Discovery."
   - This indicates that the tactic in question is related to gathering information about the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, not the preparatory steps.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system, not about gathering information.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which aligns with the question's mention of detailed gathering of system information.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - While this is also about gathering information, the related TTPs specifically mention "Discovery" and "T1082-System Information Discovery."

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the "Discovery" tactic, as it directly involves the detailed gathering of system information.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
