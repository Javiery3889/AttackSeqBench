Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by FIN13:
1. Using proxies and encoding data for command and control.
2. Using web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data.
3. Stealing data for fraudulent transactions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This indicates that the attackers are using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This indicates that the ultimate goal is financial theft.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the others in the sequence.

- **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the creation and maintenance of resources used in the attack. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the interaction between an attacker and a compromised system. The question mentions using proxies and encoding data for command and control, which aligns with this tactic.
- **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. The question mentions stealing data for fraudulent transactions, which aligns with this tactic.
- **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the gathering of information about the target. While reconnaissance could be part of the initial phase, the question does not specifically mention reconnaissance as a step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Command and Control (B)**: The use of proxies and encoding data for command and control is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
2. **Exfiltration (C)**: After establishing command and control, the next step would be to steal data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
3. **Financial Theft (T1657)**: The ultimate goal is to use the stolen data for fraudulent transactions, which aligns with the Financial Theft technique.

### Final Answer
Based on the sequence of actions described in the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Command and Control (B) occurred before Exfiltration (C).

Final Answer: B
