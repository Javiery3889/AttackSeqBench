Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy initially achieves access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers. The next step involves targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely informed their strategic targeting of these systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network.
  - **Technique T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain initial access.
  - **Technique T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link in a spearphishing email to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the ability to direct the compromised system.
- **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the resources needed to conduct the attack.
- **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack.

Given that the question describes the initial access phase and the subsequent targeting of ICS control workstations, we need to focus on the tactics and techniques that would inform the strategic targeting of these systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that GreyEnergy achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers. This aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.
2. **Strategic Targeting**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to strategically target ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers. This strategic targeting is likely informed by the **Reconnaissance** tactic, as it involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
