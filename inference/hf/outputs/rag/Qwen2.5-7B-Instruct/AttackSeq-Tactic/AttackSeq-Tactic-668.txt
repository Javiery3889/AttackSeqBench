Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Dexphot loaded executables into system processes via process hollowing.
2. An unknown tactic occurred after this.
3. The final step was ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that scheduled tasks are used for persistence.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This indicates that process hollowing is used to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that scheduled tasks are used for execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Process Hollowing (T1055.012)**: This is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, which aligns with the first part of the sequence.
- **Scheduled Tasks (T1053.005)**: This is a technique used for both execution and persistence, which aligns with the final part of the sequence.

Given the sequence described in the question, we need to determine the tactic that occurs after process hollowing and before persistence. The related TTPs suggest that the tactic in question is likely related to evasion or execution, as these are the steps that occur between process hollowing and persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Process Hollowing (T1055.012)**: This is the first step where Dexphot injects executables into system processes.
2. **Defense Evasion (T1055.012)**: This is the tactic that would follow process hollowing, as it is a method to evade detection and ensure that the malicious activity remains hidden.
3. **Persistence (T1053.005)**: This is the final step where Dexphot ensures that the malicious activity continues by using scheduled tasks.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Process Hollowing (T1055.012) -> Defense Evasion (T1055.012) -> Persistence (T1053.005)

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
