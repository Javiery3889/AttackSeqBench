Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. SBDH malware uses filters in its configuration files to collect targeted data based on specific criteria (file extension, creation date, and file size).
2. The malware then manages network communications with a remote server using protocols such as HTTP and SMTP.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Persistence**: This tactic is not directly related to the network communication aspect.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (data collection based on specific criteria).
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves managing network communications with a remote server, which aligns with the second part of the sequence (network communication using HTTP and SMTP).
- **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data to an external location, which is a step that could follow data collection but is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection, which is not directly related to the network communication aspect.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic is directly related to the first part of the sequence, where the malware collects data based on specific criteria.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic is directly related to the second part of the sequence, where the malware manages network communications with a remote server using HTTP and SMTP.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware first collects data based on specific criteria (file extension, creation date, and file size). This aligns with the **Collection** tactic.
2. After collecting the data, the malware manages network communications with a remote server using protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. This aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Collection** (B) to manage the data collection process.
- **Command and Control** (C) to manage the network communications with the remote server.

### Final Answer: C
