Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands, and injecting processes on remote computers. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next in this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the target network.
- **Technique T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools to a target system to facilitate lateral movement.
- **Technique T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen hashes to gain access to other systems.
- **Technique T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using SSH to move laterally within the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or attribution. While it could be relevant later in the attack chain, it is not directly related to the immediate actions following lateral movement.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system or network. While it is a critical part of an attack, it is not the immediate next step after lateral movement.
- **Impact (C)**: This tactic involves actions that directly harm the victim. It is a potential end goal but not the immediate next step after lateral movement.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within the network. The question already mentions lateral movement, so this is not the next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, which means they have already moved to another system.
- The next logical step would be to maintain control over the newly compromised system or to perform actions that directly impact the target.
- **Command and Control (B)** is the most plausible next step because it involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which is a critical part of an ongoing attack.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
