Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Vyveva's backdoor compressed files with zlib.
2. The backdoor collected these compressed files from the computer.
3. The backdoor exfiltrated the data to its C&C server.

We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the collection of compressed files but before the exfiltration of the data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection (Tactic)**: This is the process of gathering data.
- **Archive via Library (Technique)**: This is a method of compressing files.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic)**: This is the process of transferring data to an external location.
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique)**: This is a method of exfiltrating data using a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This is a tactic that involves maintaining access to the target system. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
  
- **B: Privilege Escalation**
  - This is a tactic that involves gaining higher-level access to a system. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
  
- **C: Exfiltration**
  - This is the tactic that involves transferring data to an external location. The question states that this occurs after the collection and compression of files, which fits the sequence described.
  
- **D: Initial Access**
  - This is the tactic that involves gaining initial access to a system. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor first compresses and collects files (Collection and Archive via Library).
- The next step in the sequence is to transfer the collected and compressed data to the C&C server (Exfiltration).

Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the collection and compression of files but before the exfiltration of the data is **Exfiltration**.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
