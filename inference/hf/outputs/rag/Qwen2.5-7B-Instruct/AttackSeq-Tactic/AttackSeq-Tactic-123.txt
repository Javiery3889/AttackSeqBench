Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the 'Surtr' malware:
1. Listed file directories
2. Executed remote commands
3. Logged keystrokes
4. Connected to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection**: Technique T1056.001-Keylogging (Keystroke logging)
- **Command and Control**: Technique T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (Downloading a stage two component)
- **Discovery**: Technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery (Listing file directories)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (T1083)**: This tactic involves identifying and gathering information about the network and systems. The malware listed file directories, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Collection (T1056.001)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the victim's system. The malware logged keystrokes, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Command and Control (T1104)**: This tactic involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. The malware connected to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Discovery**: The malware listed file directories, which is a clear indication of the Discovery tactic.
2. **Collection**: The malware logged keystrokes, which is a clear indication of the Collection tactic.
3. **Command and Control**: The malware connected to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer
The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns most closely with the Command and Control tactic, as it involves establishing a communication channel and downloading a stage two component.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
