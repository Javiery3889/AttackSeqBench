Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests after ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before this communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about the Command and Control (C2) tactic and specific techniques:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages or channels for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which tactic occurred before the communication with control servers (C2).

- **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. The question mentions ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder, which is a persistence technique.
- **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system. The question states that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which is a C2 technique.
- **Resource Development (R):** This tactic involves developing and preparing resources for the attack. It is not directly related to the communication with control servers.
- **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves the attacker learning information about the target environment. It is also not directly related to the communication with control servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where persistence is established first, followed by communication with control servers.
- The related TTPs confirm that the communication with control servers is a Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- The persistence technique (downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder) is a prerequisite for the C2 communication.

Given this analysis, the tactic that most likely occurred before the communication with control servers is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: C
