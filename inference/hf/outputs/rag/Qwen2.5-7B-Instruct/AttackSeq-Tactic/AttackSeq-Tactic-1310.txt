Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where a threat actor uses RTF documents to exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities, drops 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder, and requires a relaunch of Word for full execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This TTP involves the use of a malicious file to execute code.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This TTP involves adding malicious add-ins to a software application to maintain persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**: This TTP is about gaining higher-level access to a system. The described actions do not involve gaining higher-level access but rather dropping a file and setting up persistence.
- **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**: This TTP is about developing resources for an attack, which does not fit the described sequence of actions.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This TTP is about gaining access to a target system. The described actions are more about what happens after initial access, not the initial access itself.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This TTP involves the execution of code or commands. The described actions involve dropping a file and setting up persistence, which aligns with the Execution Tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actor uses RTF documents to exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities, which is a form of Initial Access.
2. The 'intel.wll' file is dropped into the Word startup folder, which is a form of Persistence.
3. The requirement for a relaunch of Word for full execution indicates that the file is being executed, which aligns with the Execution Tactic.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution, as it covers the execution of the malicious file after it has been dropped.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
