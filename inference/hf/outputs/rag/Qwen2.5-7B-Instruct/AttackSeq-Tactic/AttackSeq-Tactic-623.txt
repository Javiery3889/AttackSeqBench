Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where valid credentials are obtained for lateral movement, and then the attacker locates relevant systems, users, and data. The key points are:
- Valid credentials are obtained.
- Lateral movement is not yet performed.
- The attacker needs to locate relevant systems, users, and data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Persistence**: T1078.002-Domain Accounts
- **Initial Access**: T1078-Valid Accounts
- **Reconnaissance**: T1589.001-Credentials

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: Credential Access**
  - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is part of the sequence but does not directly involve locating systems, users, and data.

- **B: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. The question states that lateral movement has not yet occurred, so this is not the correct answer.

- **C: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which aligns with the need to locate relevant systems, users, and data. It is a logical step after obtaining valid credentials.

- **D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering data, which is mentioned in the question but occurs after the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence starts with obtaining valid credentials (likely through Initial Access or Reconnaissance).
- The next step is to discover relevant systems, users, and data within the network.
- Lateral movement and data collection follow after discovery.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
