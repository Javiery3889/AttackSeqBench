Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already established persistence through a scheduled task named 'Windows Update'.
   - The next step in the sequence is gathering detailed system information from the victim's machine, including hostname and OS version.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** The attackers have used T1053.005-Scheduled Task to establish persistence.
   - **Discovery (Tactic):** The next step involves gathering system information, which aligns with the Discovery tactic (T1082-System Information Discovery).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. It does not fit the sequence as the next step is to gather system information, not move to another system.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information to understand the network and the systems within it. It fits the sequence as the next step is to gather detailed system information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection or response. It does not fit the sequence as the next step is to gather system information, not evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the network. It does not fit the sequence as the persistence step has already occurred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Discovery tactic, as it directly follows the persistence step and aligns with the next action of gathering system information.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
