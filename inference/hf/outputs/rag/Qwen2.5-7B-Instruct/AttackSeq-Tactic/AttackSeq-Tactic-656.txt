Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware (GAMEFISH) is executed through exploit documents from spear-phishing emails. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT28 moved laterally by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The related TTPs mention spear-phishing, which is a common method for initial access.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the adversary moving from the initial foothold to other parts of the network. The related TTP mentions exploiting remote services, which is a method of lateral movement.

Given the sequence described in the question, the initial access would be the step that precedes the lateral movement. The spear-phishing emails are the initial method of gaining access, and then the exploitation of vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers is the method of moving laterally.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware (GAMEFISH) is delivered through spear-phishing emails, which is a form of initial access.
2. **Lateral Movement**: After gaining initial access, the adversary exploits known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move laterally within the network.

Based on this reasoning, the tactic that most likely occurred before APT28 moved laterally is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
