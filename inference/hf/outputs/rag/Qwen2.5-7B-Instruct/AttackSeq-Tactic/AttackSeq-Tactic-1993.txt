Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Lazarus group achieved persistence.
2. They used a loader-type malware to register variations for auto-execution.
3. They harvested credentials using the Responder tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Persistence**: Technique T1053.002-At
- **Credential Access**: Techniques T1040-Network Sniffing and T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred between achieving persistence and harvesting credentials.

- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic is about avoiding defensive mechanisms, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of achieving persistence and then harvesting credentials.
- **Impact (B)**: This tactic is about causing harm or disruption, which is not directly related to the sequence of persistence and credential harvesting.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another, which is not directly related to the sequence of persistence and credential harvesting.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the step of harvesting credentials using the Responder tool.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Lazarus group achieved persistence by registering variations of the loader-type malware for auto-execution.
2. The next step in the sequence is to harvest credentials using the Responder tool.
3. The related TTPs indicate that Credential Access is the relevant tactic for harvesting credentials.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred between achieving persistence and harvesting credentials is Credential Access.

### Final Answer: D
