Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The Octopus malware gathers system information using WMIC.exe.
2. It communicates with hardcoded commercial web-hosting servers to receive commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. The question mentions that the malware gathers system information, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The question states that the malware communicates with servers to receive commands, which is a clear indication of C2.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Gathering System Information**: The malware uses WMIC.exe to gather system information, which is a form of Discovery.
2. **Communicating with Servers**: After gathering the information, the malware communicates with servers to receive commands. This communication is a form of Command and Control.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery (to gather system information)
- Command and Control (to communicate with servers and receive commands)

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
