Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where CozyDuke spreads via email containing links to a compromised website or Dropbox. The next step in the sequence is the execution of the CozyDuke main component using `rundll32.exe`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique describes the initial method of gaining access to the target system, which is via a spearphishing link.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using `rundll32.exe` to execute malicious code, which is the next step after gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system, which is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system, which is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about the initial method of gaining access to the target system, which is described in the question but is not the next step.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This tactic involves running the malicious payload, which aligns with the next step after gaining initial access, as described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: CozyDuke spreads via email containing links to a compromised website or Dropbox.
2. **Execution**: The CozyDuke main component is executed using `rundll32.exe`.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the next step after gaining initial access is the execution of the malicious payload.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
