Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol for remote code execution.**
- **No artifacts were left on disk.**
- **Before establishing three primary IP addresses for their C&C infrastructure.**

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gallmaker used DDE for remote code execution.** This aligns with the technique T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange, which is under the Execution Tactic.
- **No artifacts were left on disk.** This suggests that the execution was stealthy and did not leave traces.
- **Before establishing C&C infrastructure.** This indicates that the next step would be to set up the communication channel with the C&C server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution (T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange)**: This is the initial step where Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol for remote code execution.
2. **No artifacts on disk**: This confirms that the execution was stealthy and did not leave traces.
3. **Command and Control (T1071.004-DNS)**: After the execution, the next step would be to establish a C&C infrastructure, which involves setting up communication channels. DNS is a common method for C&C communication.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is from Execution to Command and Control.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
