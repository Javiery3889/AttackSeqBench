Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Derusbi gathers host information.
2. The information is transferred back via network beacons.
3. The communication uses a random source port and a preconfigured destination port 443.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1571-Non-Standard Port

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target network. The use of network beacons and communication through a non-standard port (443) aligns with this tactic.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the question mentions gathering host information, the specific communication method (non-standard port) is more indicative of Command and Control.
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. The question does not mention any actions that would elevate privileges.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems to be targeted. The question does not describe the initial discovery phase but rather the communication phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the transfer of information via network beacons, which is a common method in Command and Control.
- The use of a non-standard port (443) for communication is a technique (T1571-Non-Standard Port) that is part of the Command and Control tactic.
- The other options (Collection, Privilege Escalation, and Discovery) do not align as closely with the described communication method.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
