Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials and redirect users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona. This indicates that the initial step involves collecting credentials, which is a form of credential access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586-Compromise Accounts**: This technique involves compromising accounts to gain access to resources.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which aligns with the initial step of collecting credentials.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This technique involves establishing accounts, which could be a precursor to compromising accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This is the initial step of collecting credentials, which is directly described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This typically involves identifying and classifying resources, which is not directly related to the initial step of collecting credentials.
- **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**: This involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the initial step of collecting credentials.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This involves establishing channels for communication, which is not directly related to the initial step of collecting credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of fictitious login sites to collect credentials, which is a form of credential access.
- The related TTPs include techniques for gathering credentials (T1589.001-Credentials) and establishing accounts (T1585-Establish Accounts), which are preparatory steps for further actions.
- The next logical step after collecting credentials would be to use those credentials to access the compromised accounts, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

### Final Answer: A: Credential Access
