Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Raccoon stealer collects valuable data.
2. The collected data includes system information, account data, bank card details, and crypto wallet configurations.
3. The JS-sniffer's code is obfuscated using the aaencode algorithm to hide it.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Discovery (Tactic):** T1217 - Browser Information Discovery
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic is about transferring data from the target to another location. While the question mentions data collection, it does not directly relate to the obfuscation of the JS-sniffer's code.
- **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code. However, the question is more about the obfuscation of the code rather than the execution of the code.
- **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference. The use of the aaencode algorithm to hide the JS-sniffer's code is a form of defense evasion, as it makes the code harder to detect and analyze.
- **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. While persistence might be a goal, the question is specifically about the obfuscation of the code.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of the aaencode algorithm to obfuscate the JS-sniffer's code. This is a technique to evade detection and analysis, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, which is a sub-technique under Defense Evasion.
- The collection of data (step 1) and the use of the JS-sniffer (step 2) are part of the initial attack phase, which is not directly related to the obfuscation technique.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
