Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where backdoors are installed on financial institution systems, and before connecting to command and control (C2) servers, an action is taken to avoid detection. The goal is to identify which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to have occurred in this context.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for communication to evade detection and ensure reliable communication with the C2 server.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves having multiple fallback communication channels in case the primary C2 channel is detected and shut down.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While it is relevant, it is not directly related to the immediate actions taken before connecting to the C2 server.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves the actions taken to run malicious code. Installing backdoors is an execution step, but it does not directly address the need to avoid detection before connecting to the C2 server.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. It is not directly related to the immediate action of avoiding detection before connecting to the C2 server.
- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the need to avoid detection before connecting to the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions avoiding detection before connecting to the C2 server. The related TTPs, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels and T1008-Fallback Channels, both involve techniques to avoid detection and ensure reliable communication with the C2 server.
- T1104-Multi-Stage Channels involves using multiple channels, which can help evade detection by defenders.
- T1008-Fallback Channels involves having multiple fallback channels, which can ensure reliable communication even if one channel is detected and shut down.

Given that the goal is to avoid detection before connecting to the C2 server, the most relevant tactic is **Defense Evasion**, as it directly addresses the need to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
