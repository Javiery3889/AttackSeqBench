Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors:
1. Utilized spear-phishing emails
2. Utilized watering hole attacks
3. Delivered malicious payloads exploiting known vulnerabilities in RTF and Excel files

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the initial access phase of the attack:
- **Tactic: Initial Access**
  - **Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - **Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the initial access phase, given the sequence of actions described.

- **A: Privilege Escalation** - This typically occurs after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network. It is not the immediate next step after delivering a payload.
- **B: Execution** - This is the process of running the malicious payload. It is a logical step immediately after the payload is delivered.
- **C: Initial Access** - This is the first step in the attack lifecycle, which has already been described in the question.
- **D: Defense Evasion** - This is used to avoid detection and is not the immediate next step after delivering a payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access** (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment and T1189-Drive-by Compromise) - This is the first step where the actors gain initial access to the target environment.
2. **Execution** - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malicious payload delivered via the spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible next step after delivering the malicious payload is the execution of the payload.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
