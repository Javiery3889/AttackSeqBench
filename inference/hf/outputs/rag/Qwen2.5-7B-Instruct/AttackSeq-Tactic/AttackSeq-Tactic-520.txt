Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where attackers sent malicious email attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel, Word, and Java to gain a foothold in the target systems. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment." This indicates that the initial action of sending malicious email attachments is part of the "Initial Access" tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This typically occurs after gaining initial access to a system.
- **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
  - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level access on a system. This is also a step that typically follows gaining initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access is the tactic of gaining access to the target environment. The question already describes this initial action.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**
  - Execution involves running code or programs on the target system. This is a step that often follows gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the initial action of sending malicious email attachments, which is part of the "Initial Access" tactic.
2. After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to execute the malicious code or programs on the target system to gain a foothold.
3. Among the given choices, "Execution" (D) is the most plausible step that follows the initial access.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
