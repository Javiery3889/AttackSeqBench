Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their C&C servers.
2. They used cloud-hosted proxies.
3. They operated about a dozen live C&C servers to issue commands to narrowly targeted botnets.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1090-Proxy (External Proxy and Multi-hop Proxy)
- Tactic: Command and Control

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using proxies to hide the true origin of network traffic. The related sub-techniques (T1090.002 and T1090.003) specifically mention external and multi-hop proxies, which align with the use of cloud-hosted proxies mentioned in the question.
- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems to issue commands and retrieve data.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Obfuscation**: The question mentions multiple layers of obfuscation, which is a form of defense evasion (T1562.001). However, this is not directly related to the TTPs provided.
2. **Cloud-hosted Proxies**: The use of cloud-hosted proxies (T1090.002 and T1090.003) is a method of command and control (C2) where the attacker uses proxies to hide the true origin of their C&C traffic.
3. **Live C&C Servers**: Operating a dozen live C&C servers (T1090) is a direct part of the command and control tactic.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the Command and Control tactic, as it encompasses the use of proxies and the operation of live C&C servers.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
