Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first conduct Command and Control (C&C) by hiding C&C data using steganography in PDF or JPG files. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable the attackers to transfer the stolen data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1001.002-Steganography**: This indicates that the attackers used steganography to hide C&C data in files like PDF or JPG.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.003-Steganography**: This suggests that the attackers used steganography to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic is about gathering information to be used for future attacks. While it might be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to transferring stolen data.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or investigation. While the use of steganography to hide C&C data in files like PDF or JPG can be considered a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about transferring stolen data.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. The question mentions that the attackers hid C&C data using steganography, which is a method to transfer data covertly. Therefore, this TTP is directly related to the transfer of data.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing and maintaining access to the target. While it is related to the initial C&C setup, the question is specifically about the transfer of stolen data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers used steganography to hide C&C data in files like PDF or JPG, which is a method to transfer data covertly.
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable the attackers to transfer the stolen data.
- Exfiltration (C) is the tactic that directly involves the transfer of data, which aligns with the use of steganography to hide and transfer data.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
