Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Delivery of the NetTraveler Trojan through spear-phishing emails.
2. Use of lookalike news and military domains to facilitate communication with compromised systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link in a spear-phishing email to gain initial access to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question. Resource Development involves the creation and maintenance of infrastructure to support an adversary's operations.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic is relevant to the initial phase of the attack, which is the delivery of the NetTraveler Trojan through spear-phishing emails. However, the question specifically mentions communication with compromised systems, which is more aligned with a different tactic.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the interaction between systems to deliver and support the attack. The use of lookalike domains to facilitate communication with compromised systems is a clear indication of Command and Control.
- **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question focuses on the communication phase, not the data exfiltration phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The NetTraveler Trojan is delivered through spear-phishing emails, which is an Initial Access technique.
- The use of lookalike news and military domains to facilitate communication with compromised systems is a clear indication of Command and Control, as it involves maintaining the interaction between the attacker and the compromised system.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
