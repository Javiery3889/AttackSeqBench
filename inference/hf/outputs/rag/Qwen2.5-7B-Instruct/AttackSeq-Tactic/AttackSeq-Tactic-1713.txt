Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BRONZE PRESIDENT developed remote access tools and used publicly available tools. The sequence then involves gaining administrator access using phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the group gained administrator access using these phishing emails.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

These techniques are both under the Initial Access tactic, which involves the methods used to initially infiltrate a network. The question specifically mentions phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files, which aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment technique.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan an attack. While reconnaissance could occur before initial access, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned in the question.
- **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target network. Discovery typically occurs after initial access, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
- **C: Initial Access** - This tactic directly involves the methods used to initially gain access to the target network. The related TTPs specifically mention spearphishing techniques, which are a form of initial access.
- **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running code or commands on the target system. Execution typically occurs after gaining access, so it is not the correct answer for the sequence before gaining administrator access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before gaining administrator access using phishing emails.
- The related TTPs clearly indicate that the spearphishing techniques (both T1566.001 and T1566.002) fall under the Initial Access tactic.
- Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before gaining administrator access is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
