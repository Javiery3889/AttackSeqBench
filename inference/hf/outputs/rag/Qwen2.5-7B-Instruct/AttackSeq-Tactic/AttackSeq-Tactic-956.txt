Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by an attacker:
1. The attacker deleted the original malicious file to evade defenses.
2. The attacker used hidden directories as part of their defense evasion strategy.
3. The malware targeted registry keys for stored passwords.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion**: T1070.004-File Deletion (deleting the original malicious file)
- **Defense Evasion**: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories (using hidden directories)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic and technique aligns best with the next step in the sequence, which is targeting registry keys for stored passwords.

- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information and data. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly align with the specific action of targeting registry keys.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic is about evading detection and defense mechanisms. The question already mentions that the attacker has used defense evasion techniques (deleting the file and using hidden directories). Therefore, this tactic is already covered.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the action of targeting registry keys for stored passwords. Registry keys often contain sensitive information, including credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation (D)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access or permissions. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the specific action of targeting registry keys.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has already used defense evasion techniques (deleting the file and using hidden directories).
- The next logical step is to perform an action that directly targets the registry keys for stored passwords, which is a form of credential access.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
