Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first gather information through social engineering techniques (phishing) and supply chain vulnerabilities.
   - The sequence then moves to gaining access by exploiting unprotected MongoDB databases and compromised Citrix systems.
   - We need to identify the tactic that occurs after gathering information and before gaining access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This includes techniques like T1566-Phishing and T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.
   - **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** This includes techniques like T1592-Gather Victim Host Information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** This is the process of gathering information about the target. The question mentions that adversaries gathered information through social engineering and supply chain vulnerabilities. This aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the process of gaining entry into the target's network or system. The question mentions gaining access by exploiting MongoDB databases and Citrix systems, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.

Given the sequence described in the question, the step that occurs after gathering information (Reconnaissance) and before gaining access (Initial Access) is clearly the Reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
