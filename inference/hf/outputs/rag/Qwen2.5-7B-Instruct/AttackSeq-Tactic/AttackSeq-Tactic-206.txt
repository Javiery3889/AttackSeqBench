Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses malicious Microsoft Word documents to deliver encrypted script data and initiate the Bandook payload. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the delivery of the encrypted script data.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spearphishing attachment to gain initial access to a system, which is the initial step in the attack sequence described.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Persistence**: Persistence refers to the attacker's ability to maintain access to the target system over time. While this is a common tactic, it is not the immediate next step after the initial delivery of the payload.
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts on the target system. Given that the question mentions the initiation of the Bandook payload, this is a strong candidate as it directly follows the delivery of the malicious script.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is a tactic that would occur after gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after the execution of the payload.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial compromise of a system, which is the first step in the attack sequence. The question already describes the initial access via spearphishing, so this is not the next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker uses malicious Microsoft Word documents to deliver encrypted script data (Initial Access via Spearphishing Attachment).
- The encrypted script data is then executed, initiating the Bandook payload (Execution).

Given this sequence, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurs immediately after the execution of the payload is Execution.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
