Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the initial access technique (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of malicious files, which could be part of the infection chain.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This is the technique where SideCopy gains initial access through malicious LNK files.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems after initial access. It does not fit the sequence as it occurs after gaining initial access.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly precede the initial access through malicious LNK files.
- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing tools and resources for the attack. It is more of a preparatory step and does not directly precede the initial access.
- **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. It is a common step that precedes gaining initial access, as the attacker needs to understand the target to craft a successful attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before gaining initial access through malicious LNK files.
- The related TTPs indicate that the initial access is through T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.
- Among the given options, **D: Reconnaissance** is the most plausible tactic that would precede the initial access. The attacker would need to gather information about the target environment to craft a successful attack, such as identifying vulnerable supply chains or systems to exploit.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
