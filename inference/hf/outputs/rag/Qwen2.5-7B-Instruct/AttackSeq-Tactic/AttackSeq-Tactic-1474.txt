Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Duke group:
1. Initiated their campaign with Trojan.Cozer via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails.
2. Compromised high-profile government networks.
3. Used Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
4. Extracted email from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.

We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the initial compromise and before the Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Lateral Movement (T1550.003-Pass the Ticket)**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network.
- **Defense Evasion (T1550.003-Pass the Ticket)**: This technique involves evading detection or defense mechanisms.
- **Credential Access (T1558.005-Ccache Files)**: This technique involves accessing and stealing credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access (T1558.005-Ccache Files)**: This TTP involves stealing credentials, which is a prerequisite for using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks. It logically comes before the pass-the-ticket attacks.
- **Exfiltration**: This TTP involves stealing data and moving it out of the network. It is more likely to occur after the pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.
- **Defense Evasion**: This TTP involves evading detection, which could occur at any point in the attack sequence but is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **Discovery**: This TTP involves identifying and gathering information about the target network. It is more likely to occur before the initial compromise and the subsequent actions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial compromise via Trojan.Cozer and themed emails is the starting point.
2. The next step would be to steal credentials to move laterally within the network.
3. After stealing credentials, the group would use Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks to move further within the network.
4. Finally, they would extract emails from the MS Exchange Server with the stolen credentials.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial compromise and before the Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: A: Credential Access
