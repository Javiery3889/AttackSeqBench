Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul botnet maintains persistence through a periodically downloaded bash script named 'cron'.
   - The key point here is that the botnet uses a cron script to ensure its continued presence on victim systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Persistence and the Technique: T1053.003-Cron.
   - This indicates that the use of cron scripts is a method of persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic is about avoiding defensive measures, which does not directly relate to the use of cron scripts for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves the botnet communicating with its command and control server, which is not directly mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the initial compromise of the system, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - This tactic directly relates to the botnet's ability to remain on the system over time, which is exactly what the question describes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is about the botnet maintaining its presence on the system using a cron script.
   - The related TTPs confirm that the use of cron scripts is a method of persistence.
   - Among the given answer choices, only "Persistence" (Answer Choice D) aligns with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
