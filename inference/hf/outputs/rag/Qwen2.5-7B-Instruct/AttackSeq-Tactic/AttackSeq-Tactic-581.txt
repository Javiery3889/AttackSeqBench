Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Higaisa APT group used the JavaScript file to execute 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information. This implies that the tactic in question should be one that precedes the discovery of network configuration details.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery

This indicates that the network configuration discovery is a part of the Discovery tactic. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before this would logically be one that enables or supports the Discovery tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding or countering defensive measures. It does not directly support or enable the Discovery tactic.
- **B: Impact** - This tactic is about causing harm or disruption. It is not a precursor to the Discovery tactic.
- **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves developing and maintaining the capabilities to carry out the attack. While it is important, it is not directly related to the immediate precursor to network configuration discovery.
- **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and gathering information about the target environment. T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery is a specific technique under the Discovery tactic. Therefore, the tactic that would most likely occur before this is another part of the Discovery tactic itself, or a tactic that enables the Discovery tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the Discovery tactic.
- The related TTPs specifically mention the Discovery tactic and the technique T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
- The tactic that enables or supports the Discovery tactic is Discovery itself.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the specific technique T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
