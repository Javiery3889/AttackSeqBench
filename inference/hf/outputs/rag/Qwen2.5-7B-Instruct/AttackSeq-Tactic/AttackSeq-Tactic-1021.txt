Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. SBDH malware is downloaded.
2. A backdoor and a data stealer are installed.
3. The attacker gains full remote control.
4. Data exfiltration methods are implemented.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion (T1222.002-Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification)**: This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions to evade detection.
- **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique involves data exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Impact**: This tactic is about the consequences of the attack, such as damage or disruption. While data exfiltration can be seen as an impact, it is not the immediate next step after gaining full control and implementing a backdoor and data stealer.

- **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. While persistence is crucial, it is not the immediate next step after gaining full control and implementing a backdoor and data stealer.

- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While the malware download and installation of a backdoor and data stealer are part of execution, the question is asking about the next step after these actions.

- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this is a critical step, it is not the immediate next step after gaining full control and implementing a backdoor and data stealer.

### Step 4: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Exfiltration**. The attacker has gained full remote control and implemented a data stealer, which is a method to gather and exfiltrate data. The related TTPs specifically mention exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the question's description.

### Final Answer: Exfiltration (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)

Final Answer: Exfiltration
