Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Deep Panda employed the Fire Chili rootkit to hide malicious artifacts, files, processes, and network connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is directly related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs (T1564.001 and T1014).
  - Both techniques (Hidden Files and Directories and Rootkit) are methods used to evade detection and hide malicious activities.
  - However, the question asks which tactic occurred before the Fire Chili rootkit was employed, and both techniques fall under the same tactic.

- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems.
  - There is no direct indication in the related TTPs that lateral movement occurred before the rootkit was employed.

- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
  - This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources needed to conduct an attack.
  - While this could be a precursor to the attack, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned in the related TTPs.

- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves gathering information to identify assets and resources.
  - Discovery is a common step before employing techniques to hide artifacts, files, processes, and network connections.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Fire Chili rootkit is used to hide malicious artifacts, files, processes, and network connections.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for hiding files and directories (T1564.001) and using rootkits (T1014).
- Both of these techniques fall under the Defense Evasion tactic.
- However, the question asks which tactic occurred before the rootkit was employed.
- Discovery (Tactic: Reconnaissance) is a common step that precedes the use of techniques to hide artifacts and evade detection.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
