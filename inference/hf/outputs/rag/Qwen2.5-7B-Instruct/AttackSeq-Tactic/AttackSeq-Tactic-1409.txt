Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, allowing the Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide us with the following information:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**

These techniques indicate that the initial compromise of the system occurred through a supply chain attack, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence:

- **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting the target's network or systems. While it is a common step in many attacks, it does not directly follow the initial compromise through a supply chain attack.
- **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after the initial compromise.
- **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code or scripts on the target system. Given that the trojanized 3CX software was used to deliver the Smooth Operator malware, this is a likely next step after the initial compromise.
- **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. Since the question already describes the initial access through a supply chain attack, this is not the next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes a supply chain attack where the 3CX software was trojanized.
- The next logical step after the initial compromise would be to execute the malware delivered through the compromised software.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the execution of the malware.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
