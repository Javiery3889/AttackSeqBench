Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT (Remote Access Tool) component uses DNS to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server. Additionally, it mentions that the traffic is disguised using substitute ciphers and obfuscated data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for command and control communications.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to obfuscate data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying assets and resources. It does not align with the described sequence of using DNS for C2 communication and obfuscating data.
- **Answer Choice B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly align with the described sequence of using DNS and obfuscation.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. It does not directly align with the described sequence of using DNS and obfuscation.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. The use of DNS for C2 communication and obfuscation of data aligns directly with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT component uses DNS for C2 communication and employs substitute ciphers and obfuscation techniques.
- The related TTPs specifically mention Command and Control as the tactic, with techniques T1071.004-DNS and T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography.
- The described sequence of using DNS for C2 communication and obfuscation of data is directly aligned with the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
