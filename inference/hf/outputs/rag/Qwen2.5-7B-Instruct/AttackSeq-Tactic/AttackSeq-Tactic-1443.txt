Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary gained Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF linked to ENVYSCOUT. Before this, the infrastructure necessary for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s was provided.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This is a specific type of spear-phishing that uses links to deliver malware or other malicious content.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running or executing malware or other code on the target's system. This does not fit the context of providing infrastructure for hosting scripts and C2s.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target's network or system. While it is part of the sequence, it does not directly provide the infrastructure for hosting scripts and C2s.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the resources necessary for the attack, such as infrastructure for hosting scripts and C2s. This aligns well with the context of providing the necessary infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary controlling the compromised system or network. While it is part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly provide the infrastructure for hosting scripts and C2s.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the adversary needs to provide infrastructure for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s before gaining Initial Access through spear-phishing.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for Initial Access, but none of them directly address the provision of infrastructure.
- The most plausible TTP that fits the context of providing the necessary infrastructure is **Resource Development**.

### Final Answer: C: Resource Development
