Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Tortoiseshell maintained persistence on the victim's system using the RAT named 'IvizTech'.
2. The next step is the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This suggests that the attacker is executing commands or scripts.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This indicates that the attacker is gathering information about the system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after maintaining persistence and before detailed information collection.

- **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the use of 'bird.exe' to collect detailed information.
- **C: Impact**: This tactic involves causing harm or damage, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Maintaining Persistence**: This is the initial step, which is not directly related to the options provided.
- **Execution**: The use of a RAT (Remote Access Tool) like 'IvizTech' suggests that the attacker is executing commands or scripts.
- **Discovery**: The use of 'bird.exe' to collect detailed information about the victim's machine aligns with the Discovery tactic, as it involves gathering information about the system.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Discovery tactic, as it directly follows maintaining persistence and precedes the detailed information collection.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
