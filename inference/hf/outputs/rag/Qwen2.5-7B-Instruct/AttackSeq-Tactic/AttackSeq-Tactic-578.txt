Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with "gaining initial access by distributing malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae and IELTS exam results via spear-phishing."
   - This indicates the Tactic of Initial Access.
   - The next step is "Higaisa ensured persistence by adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks."
   - This indicates the Tactic of Persistence.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing** - This confirms the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task** - This confirms the persistence technique of adding a file to scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence** - This is the Tactic that follows Initial Access and is directly related to the technique of adding a file to scheduled tasks.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - This Tactic is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance** - This Tactic is also not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution** - While Execution is a part of the attack lifecycle, it is not the Tactic that follows Initial Access in this specific sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after Initial Access, the next Tactic is Persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
