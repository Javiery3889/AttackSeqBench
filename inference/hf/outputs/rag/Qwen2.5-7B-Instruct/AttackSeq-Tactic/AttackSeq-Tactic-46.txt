Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting information from compromised hosts using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware.
2. Sending commands and receiving results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: This tactic involves the use of web protocols for command and control.
- **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This tactic involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the initial entry into a network, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the use of web protocols for command and control, which aligns with the HTTP requests to PHP scripts on C2 servers.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves exfiltrating data, which is not the primary action described in the question (sending commands and receiving results).
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the attackers sending commands and receiving results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers. This action is directly related to the Command and Control tactic, specifically the use of web protocols (T1071.001).
- The related TTPs confirm that Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols) is the relevant tactic for this action.

### Final Answer: B
