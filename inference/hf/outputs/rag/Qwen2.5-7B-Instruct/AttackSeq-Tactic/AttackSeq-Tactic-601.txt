Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN4 conducted reconnaissance to target individuals with access to confidential information. After reconnaissance, the next step was gaining initial access through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

These TTPs are related to the initial access tactic, specifically mentioning spearphishing as a method to gain access. The question mentions "spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros," which aligns with these TTPs.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
  - This is the first step mentioned in the question, where FIN4 conducted reconnaissance to target individuals.
- **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
  - This tactic is about maintaining access over time, which is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is about avoiding detection, which is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is about developing the resources needed for the attack, which is not the immediate next step after initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with reconnaissance, followed by gaining initial access through spearphishing emails.
- The related TTPs confirm that the initial access is achieved through spearphishing, which aligns with the techniques T1566.001 and T1566.002.
- The next step after reconnaissance and gaining initial access is the use of the spearphishing emails to gain access.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
