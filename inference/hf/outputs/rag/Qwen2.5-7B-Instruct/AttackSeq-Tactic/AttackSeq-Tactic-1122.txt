Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that after conducting reconnaissance through social engineering, APT42 gained initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using spear phishing to gather information.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is a tactic that involves identifying and classifying resources and systems. It is not directly related to the reconnaissance and social engineering activities mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Collection**
  - Collection is a tactic that involves gathering data from the target. While it is related to the information gathering aspect, it is not the initial step before gaining access.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
  - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target. The question mentions that the initial step was social engineering for reconnaissance, which aligns with the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
  - Resource Development is a tactic that involves developing and maintaining the infrastructure to support the attack. It is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance and social engineering activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where social engineering was used for reconnaissance, followed by gaining initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting.
- The related TTPs mention reconnaissance techniques (T1598.001-Spearphishing Service and T1598-Phishing for Information) as part of the reconnaissance tactic.
- The reconnaissance tactic (Choice C) directly aligns with the initial social engineering efforts described in the question.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
