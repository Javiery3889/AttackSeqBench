Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by GreyEnergy operators:
1. They gained credential access using tools like Mimikatz.
2. They performed an action that occurred after gaining credential access.
3. This action was before establishing internal C&C proxies.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing and using channels to exfiltrate data or issue further commands to the compromised system.
- **Internal Proxy (Technique):** This is a specific technique under Command and Control that involves setting up a proxy within the network to route traffic through the attacker-controlled server.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems or resources.
- **Internal Spearphishing (Technique):** This is a specific technique under Lateral Movement that involves sending malicious emails to users within the network to gain access to additional systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Privilege Escalation (A):** This is not directly related to the sequence described, as it involves gaining higher-level access within the system, not moving laterally or establishing C&C.
- **Command and Control (B):** While this is a relevant tactic, the question specifies that the action in question occurred before establishing internal C&C proxies.
- **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. Given that the operators have already gained credential access, the next logical step would be to move laterally to other systems to gain more access or control.
- **Credential Access (D):** This is the initial step and not the action that occurred after gaining credential access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The operators have already gained credential access.
- The next step in the sequence would be to move laterally to other systems within the network to gain more access or control.
- Establishing internal C&C proxies would be a subsequent step after gaining more access through lateral movement.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: C**
