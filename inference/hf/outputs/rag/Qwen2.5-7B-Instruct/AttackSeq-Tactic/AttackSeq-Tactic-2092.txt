Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The MSIL/Crimson downloader successfully downloads a full RAT.
2. The RAT communicates with its servers using a custom TCP protocol.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the Command and Control (C2) tactic:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for C2.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for C2.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely follows the execution of the RAT in communicating with its servers using a custom TCP protocol.

- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. While it is a common tactic, it does not directly describe the communication method.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves stealing data from the target system. It does not directly describe the communication method.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The related TTPs specifically mention using non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols, which aligns with the custom TCP protocol mentioned in the question.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves running code on the target system. It does not directly describe the communication method.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the RAT communicating with its servers using a custom TCP protocol.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for C2 that involve non-standard ports and non-application layer protocols.
- The most relevant tactic that aligns with the communication method described in the question is Command and Control (C2).

### Final Answer: C
