Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
2. This was followed by the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to a system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. While the deserialization attack could be a method of initial access, it is not the most specific or relevant TTP in this sequence.
- **Privilege Escalation (B)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The question states that the sophisticated memory-resident malware was executed, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While it is a relevant tactic, it is not the immediate step after the initial exploitation and execution of malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The deserialization attack (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) is a method of initial access, but it is not the tactic that follows the initial access.
- The execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware (T1055-Execution) is the next step after the initial access and exploitation.
- The related TTPs do not directly influence the sequence, but they support the idea of exploiting a public-facing application and evading detection, which are part of the broader attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
