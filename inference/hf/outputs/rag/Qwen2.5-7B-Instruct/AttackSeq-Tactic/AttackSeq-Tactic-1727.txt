Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the FHAPPI campaign:
1. VBScript was used to create an object in the shell.
2. PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code were executed to infect the victim's system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Execution (Tactic):** This tactic involves the creation and running of code or scripts.
- **T1059.001-PowerShell (Technique):** This technique specifically involves the use of PowerShell.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
- **T1027.010-Command Obfuscation (Technique):** This technique involves making commands or scripts harder to detect or analyze.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution (Tactic):** The use of VBScript and PowerShell to execute commands aligns with the Execution tactic.
- **T1059.001-PowerShell (Technique):** This technique is directly mentioned in the question and is relevant to the use of PowerShell.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The base64 encoding of PowerShell commands is a form of command obfuscation, which is a sub-technique under Defense Evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **VBScript to create an object in the shell:** This action is part of the Execution tactic.
2. **PowerShell commands with base64 encoded code:** This action is both part of the Execution tactic (using PowerShell) and the Defense Evasion tactic (command obfuscation).

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Execution (Tactic):** The initial actions of creating an object in the shell and executing PowerShell commands.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** The base64 encoding of the PowerShell commands to evade detection.

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial actions. Since the base64 encoding is a form of Defense Evasion, it is the tactic that follows the Execution.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
