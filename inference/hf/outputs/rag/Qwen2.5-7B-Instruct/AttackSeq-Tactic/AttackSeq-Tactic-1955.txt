Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Surveying the victim's computer.
2. Sending information (name, machine serial number, and system information) to a remote server.
3. Using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
- **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using protocols that are not application layer protocols for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about identifying and classifying the target's resources. While the initial action of surveying the victim's computer could be considered discovery, the subsequent actions (sending information and using a custom protocol) are more aligned with command and control activities.

- **B: Impact**
  - Impact involves the adversary causing harm or damage to the victim's systems. The actions described do not indicate any immediate harm or damage, so this is less likely.

- **C: Command and Control**
  - Command and control involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a clear indication of command and control activities. The related TTPs (T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) also support this.

- **D: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration involves the adversary stealing data from the victim's systems. While the initial actions of sending information could be seen as a form of data exfiltration, the use of a custom protocol and non-standard port is more indicative of command and control activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial actions (surveying the computer and sending information) are preparatory steps.
- The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a clear indication of command and control activities.
- The related TTPs (T1571-Non-Standard Port and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) further support the command and control tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
