Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions that cybercriminals used leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering. This indicates that the initial step in the attack sequence is reconnaissance, where the attackers are gathering information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This tactic is about the final impact of the attack, such as financial theft. However, it does not directly relate to the initial intelligence gathering step.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1593.002-Search Engines**: This technique involves using search engines to gather information, which aligns with the use of SheYun for intelligence gathering.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This technique involves searching closed or restricted sources, which could also be part of the reconnaissance phase but is not as directly related to the use of SheYun as T1593.002.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Impact**: This is the final stage of the attack and does not follow the initial intelligence gathering step.
- **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**: This is a step that typically follows reconnaissance and is about moving data out of the target environment. While it is a logical step, it does not directly follow the intelligence gathering.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**: This is not a standard ATT&CK tactic and does not fit the context of the question.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This is the most relevant tactic as it directly follows the use of SheYun for intelligence gathering. The attackers are gathering information, which is the core of the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of SheYun for intelligence gathering, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1593.002-Search Engines is a technique under the Reconnaissance tactic.
- The next logical step after gathering intelligence is to use that information, which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
