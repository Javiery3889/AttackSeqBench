Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Turla used a RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor to gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.
   - The final step mentioned is the exfiltration of information through an encrypted OneDrive subfolder via the command and control channel.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Collection (Tactic):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment.
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media (Technique):** This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the monitoring of USB drives.
   - **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target environment to an external location.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique):** This technique involves using a command and control channel for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the information was gathered and monitored via USB drives, which aligns with the T1025 technique under the Collection tactic.
   - The final step of exfiltrating the information through an encrypted OneDrive subfolder via the command and control channel aligns with the T1041 technique under the Exfiltration tactic.

Given the sequence of events:
- The first step is the collection of information from USB drives.
- The second step is the exfiltration of that information via a command and control channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The tactic that most likely occurred before the information was exfiltrated is Collection.
   - The technique T1025-Data from Removable Media supports this.

Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: D: Collection"
