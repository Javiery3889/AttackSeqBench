Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access was gained through phishing emails.
2. Backdoors were created.
3. Lateral movement was performed using legitimate Windows and PowerShell commands combined with tools like PSExec.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This indicates that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing attack.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This indicates the use of PowerShell for execution, which aligns with the question's mention of using PowerShell for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred after gaining initial access and creating backdoors, but before leveraging PowerShell for lateral movement.

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or defend against defensive measures. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the steps mentioned.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which could be part of the initial access or backdoor creation but does not fit the sequence as it is not the step before lateral movement.
- **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance could be part of the initial access phase, it is not the step that directly follows backdoor creation and before lateral movement.
- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target environment. It is more likely to occur after initial access and backdoor creation, but before the actual lateral movement using PowerShell.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access was gained through phishing (T1534-Internal Spearphishing).
- Backdoors were created, which is a form of defense evasion (T1096).
- The next step before using PowerShell for lateral movement (T1059.001-PowerShell) is likely to be gathering information about the network and systems, which is the Collection tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
