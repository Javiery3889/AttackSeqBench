Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT gained initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This indicates that the APT used a method to trick users into downloading and installing the malware, which is a form of social engineering or deception.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves making malware appear legitimate by matching names or locations to known legitimate software or services. This is relevant to the scenario where the malware was disguised as legitimate software updates.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web page or drive-by download, which aligns with the scenario of the malware being disguised as a software update.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance**: While reconnaissance is a common step in many APT campaigns, it is not directly related to the specific method of gaining initial access described in the question.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the initial access method described.
- **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which is not directly related to the initial access method described.
- **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing resources for the APT, which is not directly related to the initial access method described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes a method of gaining initial access by tricking users into downloading malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This aligns with the **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**.
- The related TTPs also mention **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**, which further supports the idea that the malware was disguised to appear legitimate.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the initial access is the reconnaissance phase, as it would be necessary to gather information about the target (hotel guests) and the methods to deceive them.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
