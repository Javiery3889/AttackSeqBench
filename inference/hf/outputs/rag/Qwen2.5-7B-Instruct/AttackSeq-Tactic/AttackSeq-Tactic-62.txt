Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with the delivery of a Trojan dropper through spear-phishing emails.
   - The next step is the malware ensuring persistence by copying itself into the System32 directory and creating a startup service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This indicates that the malware is ensuring persistence by creating a Windows service.
   - **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**: This indicates that the initial method of gaining access to the system is through spear-phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code and the creation of processes. While it is a necessary step, it does not directly follow the initial access and persistence steps described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or desired effect of the attack. It is not the immediate step after initial access and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network or system. The question describes the delivery of the Trojan dropper through spear-phishing emails, which is a form of initial access.

Given the sequence of events:
1. Initial Access (spear-phishing emails)
2. Execution of the Trojan dropper
3. Persistence (copying into System32 and creating a startup service)

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access (spear-phishing) is followed by the execution of the dropper, and then the persistence mechanism is established.

**Final Answer: D**
