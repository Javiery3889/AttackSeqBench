Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `Get-NetComputer` during the computer profiling phase to search for computer objects and gather information on the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1124-System Time Discovery**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is about the attacker's preparation and planning, which is not directly related to the specific actions of gathering information on the network.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
  - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which could be a precursor to gathering information on the network. However, the specific commands mentioned (`whoami`, `net user`, `Get-NetComputer`) are more directly related to discovery rather than credential access.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it could be a step after gathering information, it is not the most likely precursor to the specific commands mentioned.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment, which aligns closely with the specific commands (`whoami`, `net user`, `Get-NetComputer`) used to search for computer objects and gather information on the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attackers used commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `Get-NetComputer` to gather information on the network. These commands are directly related to the Discovery tactic.
- The related TTPs, T1124-System Time Discovery and T1033-System Owner/User Discovery, further support the idea that the attackers were in the process of discovering information about the network.
- None of the other tactics (Resource Development, Credential Access, Lateral Movement) directly align with the specific actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
