Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Bitter APT group exploited known vulnerabilities using spear-phishing emails with weaponized maldocs.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment."
   - This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involves gaining access to the target network through a spear-phishing email with a weaponized document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the process of identifying the network and systems that are accessible to the attacker. This typically occurs after the initial access, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to proceed.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is a step that occurs after the attacker has gained initial access and is exploring the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - Command and control (C2) is the process of establishing and maintaining channels for communication between the attacker and the compromised systems. This is a step that occurs after the attacker has established a foothold.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial access refers to the methods and techniques used to initially gain access to a network or system. The question already describes this phase, so it is not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scenario described in the question is the initial access phase, which is already covered by the related TTPs.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step in the attack sequence is to understand the environment, which is the "Discovery" tactic.
   - Lateral movement and C2 are subsequent steps that occur after the attacker has discovered the network and systems.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
