Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using the WinInet API for HTTP communication to evade detection.
2. Sending checksum-validated VictimSystemData in HTTP headers.
3. Establishing contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

**A: Defense Evasion**
- This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While the use of the WinInet API and checksum validation could be considered evasion techniques, the primary focus of the question is on establishing contact with the C2 server, which is more aligned with Command and Control.

**B: Lateral Movement**
- This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. The question does not mention any movement within a network, so this is not the most likely answer.

**C: Command and Control**
- This tactic involves the adversary establishing and using channels to direct the actions of compromised systems. The question describes establishing contact with the C2 server, which is a clear example of Command and Control.

**D: Collection**
- This tactic involves gathering information from the victim system. While sending VictimSystemData could be part of information gathering, the primary action described is establishing contact with the C2 server, which is more aligned with Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the establishment of contact with the C2 server via HTTP GET requests.
2. The related TTPs mention Command and Control as the relevant tactic.
3. The techniques described (WinInet API for HTTP communication, checksum-validated VictimSystemData) are consistent with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
