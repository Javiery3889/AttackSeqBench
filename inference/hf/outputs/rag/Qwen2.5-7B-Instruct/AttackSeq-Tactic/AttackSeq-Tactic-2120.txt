Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities:
1. Execution using `cmd.exe` with `/C` switch.
2. Execution using PowerShell scripts.
3. Gathering system information using `GetStringValue` and `ZwGetContextThread`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target system.
- **Technique T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands.
- **Technique T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the adversaries gathered system information.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target system. While it is a necessary step, it is not directly related to the execution and gathering of system information.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary evading or bypassing security mechanisms. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the execution and gathering of system information.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to understand the target environment. The gathering of system information using `GetStringValue` and `ZwGetContextThread` is a form of discovery.
- **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining access to the target system. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the execution and gathering of system information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of execution activities (using `cmd.exe` and PowerShell) followed by gathering system information.
- The related TTPs confirm that these activities fall under the Execution tactic.
- The gathering of system information (using `GetStringValue` and `ZwGetContextThread`) is a form of discovery, which is a separate tactic.

Given the sequence of activities and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the adversaries gathered system information is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C
