Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Naikon APT group:
1. The Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information.
2. The Naikon APT group collected files, screenshots, and metadata.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Collection**: T1005-Data from Local System
- **Exfiltration**: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
- **Collection**: T1113-Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering data, which is already described in the question (system information, files, screenshots, and metadata).
  - However, the question specifically asks about facilitating communication with the C&C server, which is not directly related to data collection.

- **B: Privilege Escalation**
  - Privilege escalation is about gaining higher-level access, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.

- **C: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying and classifying resources, which is also not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.

- **D: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) involves establishing and maintaining the channels for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. This aligns with the question's requirement to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the gathering of data (system information, files, screenshots, and metadata).
- The related TTPs mention techniques for data collection and exfiltration, but these are not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
- The C2 tactic is specifically about establishing and maintaining the channels for communication, which fits the requirement of the question.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
