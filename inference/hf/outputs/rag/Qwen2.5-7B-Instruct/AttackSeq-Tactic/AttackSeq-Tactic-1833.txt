Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems.
2. Enabling remote access to steal credit card details.
3. Monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection (Tactic)**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system.
- **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves accessing data stored on the local system.
- **T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves monitoring clipboard data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. This does not align with the described actions of monitoring clipboard data and documents sent to the printer.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
  - Persistence involves maintaining access to the target system. While this might be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the action of monitoring clipboard data and documents sent to the printer.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information from the target system. This aligns well with the described actions of monitoring clipboard data and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
  - Credential access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is the first step described in the question but does not align with the described actions of monitoring clipboard data and documents sent to the printer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions that fall under the Collection tactic, specifically T1005-Data from Local System and T1115-Clipboard Data.
- The actions of monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data are directly related to the Collection tactic and the specific techniques mentioned.

### Final Answer: C: Collection
