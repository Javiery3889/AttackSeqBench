Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - It then mentions that after gaining initial access, a privilege escalation tactic occurred using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll with dynamic DLL loading and token manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" as a tactic and "Exploit Public-Facing Application" as a technique.
   - The related TTPs also mention "Privilege Escalation" as a tactic and "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" as a technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question clearly states that the initial access was gained by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks. This aligns with the "Exploit Public-Facing Application" technique under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The next step in the sequence is privilege escalation, which is described as using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll with dynamic DLL loading and token manipulation. This aligns with the "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" technique under the "Privilege Escalation" tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with "Initial Access" (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers).
   - The next step is "Privilege Escalation" (using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the privilege escalation step.
   - Based on the sequence described, the tactic that occurred before privilege escalation is "Initial Access."

Final Answer: B: Initial Access
