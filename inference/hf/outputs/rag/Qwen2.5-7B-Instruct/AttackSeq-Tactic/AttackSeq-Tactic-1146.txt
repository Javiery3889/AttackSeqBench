Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Turla's PowerShell scripts bypass antimalware scanning capabilities through AMSI patching.
2. The operators then use backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This technique involves disabling or modifying tools used for security, which aligns with the AMSI patching mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with the gathering of file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the operators used backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives.

- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering and archiving data for later analysis. While it could be part of the overall process, it doesn't directly align with the specific actions of gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves finding and classifying information to be used in subsequent actions. Gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives are clear examples of discovery activities.
- **Impact (C)**: This tactic involves making changes to the system or network to cause harm or disruption. It doesn't align with the specific actions of gathering information.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. While persistence is often a goal, it doesn't directly align with the specific actions of gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The AMSI patching (Defense Evasion) is a preparatory step to ensure the backdoors can operate undetected.
- The next logical step would be to discover and gather information about the system, which aligns with the techniques T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the operators first performed a discovery activity to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives.

### Final Answer: B
