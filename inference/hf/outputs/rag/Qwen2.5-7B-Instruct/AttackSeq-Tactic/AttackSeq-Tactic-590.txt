Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that the attackers used sophisticated methods to masquerade their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection. This indicates a tactic related to Defense Evasion, specifically the technique T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique is about making the attacker's actions appear legitimate to avoid detection.
- **Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves compromising shared content to spread malware or exfiltrate data.
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising the attacker's actions to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the attackers targeted the contents of source code repositories. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is directly related to the masquerading of the backdoor connection as an SSL connection. However, it is more about the method used to avoid detection rather than the action taken before targeting the source code repositories.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the masquerading of the backdoor connection.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While it is related to the overall attack, it is not the most direct precursor to targeting source code repositories.
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. It is the most logical step before targeting specific resources like source code repositories. After discovering the network and identifying valuable resources, the attackers would then proceed to target those resources.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers used sophisticated methods to masquerade their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The next logical step would be to discover the network and identify valuable resources, such as source code repositories.
- Targeting the contents of source code repositories is a specific action that would follow the discovery phase.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first performed a Discovery to identify the valuable resources before targeting the contents of source code repositories.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
