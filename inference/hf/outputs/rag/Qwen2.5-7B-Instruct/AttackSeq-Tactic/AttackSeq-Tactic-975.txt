Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** 
  - Technique T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
  - Technique T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols: This technique involves using file transfer protocols (FTP, WebDav) for command and control.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):**
  - Technique T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not used for command and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **FTP and WebDav Servers for Malware Updates:** This indicates that the malware is being updated via these protocols, which aligns with the T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols technique under the Command and Control tactic.
- **HTTP GET Requests for Communication:** This indicates that the malware is communicating with remote servers, which aligns with the T1071.001-Web Protocols technique under the Command and Control tactic.

Given that the malware is being updated and communicating via these protocols, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to ensure that the malware can continue to function and maintain persistence. This typically involves establishing a command and control channel to receive further instructions or updates.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions that are part of the Command and Control tactic.
- The next step in the attack sequence would be to ensure that the malware can continue to function and maintain persistence, which is also part of the Command and Control tactic.
- The related TTPs confirm that both FTP/WebDav and HTTP GET requests are part of the Command and Control tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the described actions would still be within the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
