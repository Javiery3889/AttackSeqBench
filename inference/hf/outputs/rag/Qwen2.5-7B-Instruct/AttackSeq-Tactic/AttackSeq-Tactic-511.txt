Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a payload of Crimson RAT has been designed to evade detection by killing processes. After this, the next tactic involves functionalities like keylogging and browser credential theft.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying** - This technique involves the adversary using environmental factors to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique involves the adversary capturing keystrokes to steal credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While it is a common tactic, it does not directly align with the functionalities of keylogging and browser credential theft.
- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access** - This tactic directly involves stealing credentials, which aligns with the functionalities of keylogging and browser credential theft mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems. It does not directly align with the functionalities of keylogging and browser credential theft.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target. While it can include stealing credentials, it is a broader category and does not specifically align with the keylogging and browser credential theft mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the next tactic involves functionalities like keylogging and browser credential theft.
- Keylogging and browser credential theft are directly related to the Credential Access tactic.
- The related TTPs also support this by mentioning T1056.001-Keylogging, which is a technique under the Credential Access tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
