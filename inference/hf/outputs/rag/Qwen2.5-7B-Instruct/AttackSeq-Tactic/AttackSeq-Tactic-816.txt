Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the tactic that most likely preceded the techniques employed by BlackEnergy to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and defeat the signed driver requirement. The sequence of events described is:
1. Initial entry through spear-phishing emails.
2. Execution of malicious MS Office documents.
3. Bypassing UAC and defeating signed driver requirements.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique is used to execute code in a Visual Basic environment, which is relevant to the execution phase.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spear-phishing email to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about avoiding or countering defensive measures. While it is relevant to the later stages of the attack, it does not fit as the initial step.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system. It is relevant to the later stages but not the initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It is also relevant to the later stages but not the initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining entry to the target network. The related TTPs specifically mention spear-phishing as a method of initial access, which aligns perfectly with the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the sequence of events starting with gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.
- The related TTPs confirm that spear-phishing is a method of initial access.
- The execution of malicious MS Office documents is a technique used in the execution phase, which follows the initial access.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gaining initial access through spear-phishing.

**Final Answer: D**
