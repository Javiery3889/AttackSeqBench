Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already evaded detection through modified network traffic patterns and an encrypted downloader. The next step in the sequence is to maintain communication with specific servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining access to the target network and communicating with the attacker's infrastructure.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic includes techniques to avoid detection by the defender, such as encrypted/encoded files (T1027.013) and masquerading (T1036).
- **Techniques:**
  - **T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:** This technique involves the attacker impersonating a legitimate protocol or service to evade detection.
  - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection.
  - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves the attacker disguising their activity to appear as legitimate traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with servers.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - While this tactic includes techniques to evade detection, it is more about the initial evasion rather than maintaining communication.
- **Answer Choice C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with servers.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic directly involves maintaining access and communication with the attacker's infrastructure, which aligns with the question's description of maintaining communication with specific servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the attacker maintaining communication with specific servers, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation, further support the idea of maintaining communication by disguising the traffic to appear as legitimate.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
