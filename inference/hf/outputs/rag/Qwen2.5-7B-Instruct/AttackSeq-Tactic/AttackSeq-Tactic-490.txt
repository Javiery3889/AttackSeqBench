Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Pierogi backdoor first collects system information during the Discovery phase.
   - Subsequently, the backdoor takes screenshots and executes arbitrary commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Discovery TTPs:**
     - T1057-Process Discovery
     - T1082-System Information Discovery
   - **Collection TTP:**
     - T1113-Screen Capture

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the backdoor collected system information during the Discovery phase. This aligns with T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - After collecting the information, the backdoor took screenshots, which aligns with T1113-Screen Capture, a technique under the Collection tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with Discovery (T1082-System Information Discovery).
   - The next step is Collection (T1113-Screen Capture).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the Discovery phase. Since the backdoor took screenshots, which is a Collection technique, the relevant tactic is Collection.

Final Answer: D: Collection
