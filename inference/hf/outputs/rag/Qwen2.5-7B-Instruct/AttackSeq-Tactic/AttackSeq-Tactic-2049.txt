Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. This implies that the tactic in question is likely to be one that involves the malware establishing its presence or understanding the environment before it starts collecting data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of the malware's presence, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions after installation and before data collection.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the malware collecting data from the local system, which is the action that occurs after the malware has established itself and is ready to gather information.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves the malware discovering information about the system it is running on, which is a logical step after installation and before data collection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves the initial running of the malware, which is typically the first step and not the step after installation and before data collection.
- **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the sequence of actions after installation and before data collection.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the malware communicating with a remote server, which is typically a step after data collection rather than before.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the malware discovering information about the system, which is a logical step after installation and before data collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already been installed on the compromised system.
- The next logical step would be for the malware to understand the environment it is running in, which is the purpose of the Discovery tactic.
- After understanding the environment, the malware would then proceed to gather specific types of data such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
