Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute commands and install an MSI package on the system. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial exploitation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Execution and the Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution. This indicates that the exploitation of the vulnerability to execute commands is part of the Execution Tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access is the tactic that describes the methods an attacker uses to initially gain access to a network or system. The question already mentions the exploitation of a vulnerability, which is a form of initial access. However, the question is asking about what happened after the initial access, not the initial access itself.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - Execution is the tactic that describes the methods an attacker uses to run malicious code on the target system. The question states that the vulnerability was exploited to execute commands and install an MSI package. This directly aligns with the Execution Tactic.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
  - Credential Access is the tactic that describes the methods an attacker uses to obtain credentials. While this could be a subsequent step, the question does not indicate that credentials were directly accessed or used in the described sequence.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
  - Resource Development is the tactic that describes the methods an attacker uses to develop and maintain resources for an attack. This is not directly related to the immediate actions described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the exploitation of a vulnerability to execute commands and install an MSI package.
- The related TTPs mention the Execution Tactic, which aligns with the described actions.
- The Execution Tactic is the most appropriate for the actions described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
