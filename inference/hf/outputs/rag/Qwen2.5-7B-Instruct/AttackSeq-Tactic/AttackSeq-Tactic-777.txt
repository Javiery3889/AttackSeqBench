Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers used watering hole tactics with exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 to compromise websites and deliver malware. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1189-Drive-by Compromise." This indicates that the attackers initially accessed the target systems through a drive-by compromise, which aligns with the watering hole tactics described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Execution**
  - Execution involves the running of code on the target system. While this is a critical step after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after the compromise. The attackers would need to deliver and execute malware after gaining access.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
  - Credential access involves stealing or using credentials to gain further access. This is a step that can occur after initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after the compromise. The attackers would need to execute the malware first to gain more access.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
  - Initial access is the tactic of gaining access to the target environment. This is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already described in the question. The question is asking about what happens after the initial access, so this is not the correct answer.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration involves the theft of data from the target system. This is a step that can occur after the attackers have gained access and executed malware, but it is not the immediate next step after the compromise. The attackers would need to execute the malware first to steal data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers used watering hole tactics to compromise websites and deliver malware. This is an initial access technique (T1189-Drive-by Compromise).
- After the initial access, the attackers would need to execute the malware to gain further access or steal data.
- The next logical step after the initial compromise and execution of malware would be to steal data, which is the exfiltration tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
