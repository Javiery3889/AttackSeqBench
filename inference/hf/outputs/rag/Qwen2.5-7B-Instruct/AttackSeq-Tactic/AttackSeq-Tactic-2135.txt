Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT15 deployed a RoyalDNS backdoor. This backdoor installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this deployment.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.004-DNS

This indicates that the backdoor uses DNS for command and control communications, which is a form of maintaining persistent access to the victim's network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Persistence**
  - Persistence is about maintaining access to the network over time. Deploying a backdoor that installs persistently on the network aligns with this tactic.
- **B: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is about developing and maintaining the resources needed for an attack. While it's a valid tactic, it doesn't directly follow the deployment of a backdoor.
- **C: Privilege Escalation**
  - Privilege escalation is about gaining higher levels of access or permissions. This is not directly related to the deployment of a backdoor or maintaining persistent access.
- **D: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration is about stealing data from the network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after deploying a persistent backdoor.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The RoyalDNS backdoor is deployed and installed persistently, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.
- The backdoor uses DNS for command and control, which is a form of maintaining persistent access.
- Exfiltration (D) and Resource Development (B) are not directly related to the immediate next step after deployment.
- Privilege Escalation (C) is not relevant to the immediate next step after deploying a persistent backdoor.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
