Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Anti-analysis techniques (custom packer and virtual machine) are used during the delivery of the malware payload.
2. The malware then downloads a second stage shellcode.
3. The second stage shellcode communicates with specific servers for further control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
- **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple channels for command and control communication.
- **Discovery (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities.
- **Time-Based Evasion (T1497.003):** This technique involves using time-based methods to evade detection.
- **Embedded Payloads (T1027.009):** This technique involves embedding the payload within other files or processes to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the communication with specific servers.
- **Command and Control (B):** This tactic directly involves the communication with specific servers for further control, which aligns with the final step described in the question.
- **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While it is an initial step, it does not fit the context of the question.
- **Exfiltration (D):** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the communication with specific servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware uses anti-analysis techniques to deliver the payload and then downloads a second stage shellcode.
- The second stage shellcode communicates with specific servers for further control.
- The related TTPs mention the Command and Control tactic and the T1104-Multi-Stage Channels technique, which directly align with the final step of the question.

### Final Answer: B
