Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Pierogi backdoor has already conducted data collection by taking screenshots and executing commands via CMD shell. The next step in the sequence is the upload of machine information and screenshots to predefined URLs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Collection and the Technique: T1113-Screen Capture. This indicates that the backdoor is involved in collecting data, specifically through screen capture.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. It does not directly relate to the data collection and uploading described in the question.
- **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target system. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the data collection and uploading described.
- **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the target system. The question describes the backdoor uploading machine information and screenshots, which aligns with the exfiltration tactic.
- **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack. It does not directly address the data collection and uploading described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor has already conducted data collection (screenshots and CMD shell commands).
- The next step is the upload of this collected data to predefined URLs.
- The tactic that best fits this sequence is Exfiltration, as it directly involves the extraction and transfer of data from the target system to the attacker's control.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
