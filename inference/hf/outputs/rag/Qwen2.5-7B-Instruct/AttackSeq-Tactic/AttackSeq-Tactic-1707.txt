Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence described involves a phishing email that delivers a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro.
   - This document is designed to execute further malicious activities.
   - The next step is the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (Initial Access)
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link (Initial Access)
     - T1059.005-Visual Basic (Execution)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target environment. The phishing email and the PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro are clearly part of the initial access phase.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves the adversary running code or commands to achieve their objectives. The VBA macro and the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper are part of the execution phase.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting systems or network resources. This is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This tactic involves the adversary developing tools or resources to support their operations. This is not directly mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The phishing email and the PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro are part of the initial access phase.
   - The VBA macro and the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper are part of the execution phase.
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the phishing email but before the use of 'mshta.exe'.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The VBA macro, which is part of the execution phase, is the step that occurs after the phishing email (initial access) but before the use of 'mshta.exe' (also part of the execution phase).

Final Answer: B: Execution
