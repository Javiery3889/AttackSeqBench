Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus threat actors used base64 blobs in malicious Office documents to match the victim's system architecture and execute them. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the execution phase, where the malicious payload is run.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

This indicates that the execution of a malicious file is a part of the sequence, but we need to determine what tactic would logically precede this execution.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. It is a common starting point for many cyber attacks. If the threat actors used base64 blobs in malicious Office documents, they would likely need to first gain access to the victim's system.
- **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying information about the target's environment, such as system configurations, network topology, and user behavior. While this is a crucial step, it is typically after initial access and before execution.
- **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's system over time. This is also a step that would come after initial access and before execution.
- **D: Execution** - This is the tactic where the adversary runs the malicious payload. As stated in the question, this is the phase where the base64 blobs are executed to match the victim's system architecture.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution phase.
- Initial Access (A) is the most logical step because it involves gaining entry to the target's system, which is necessary before any further actions like discovery, persistence, or execution.
- Discovery (B) and Persistence (C) are subsequent steps that would follow initial access.
- Execution (D) is the phase where the malicious payload is run, which is described in the question.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
