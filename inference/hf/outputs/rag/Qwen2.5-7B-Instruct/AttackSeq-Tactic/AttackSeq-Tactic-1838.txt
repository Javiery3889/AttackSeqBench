Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where CTU analysts sinkholed 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging connections and gathering statistics. This indicates that the analysts are taking action to intercept and monitor malicious traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves the creation or use of domains for malicious purposes.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking or removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**: This technique involves setting up a malicious website or drive-by download to infect users.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Impact (A)**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction of data, or denial of service. The question does not describe any direct impact but rather the interception and logging of traffic.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the steps taken to run malicious code or scripts. The question does not describe the execution of any code but rather the interception of traffic.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the methods used to direct and control compromised systems. The question describes the redirection of traffic to servers for logging, which is a form of command and control.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the methods used to find and identify systems or data that can be exploited. The question does not describe the discovery of systems but rather the interception and logging of traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The analysts sinkholed the domains, which is a form of command and control, as they are redirecting traffic to their own servers.
- The redirection of traffic to servers for logging and gathering statistics is a method of maintaining control over the compromised systems and gathering intelligence, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
