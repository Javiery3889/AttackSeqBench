Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Russian-speaking cybercriminals:
1. They used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.
2. They explored the financial systems of targeted organizations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force**: This technique is used to gain unauthorized access to systems by trying multiple passwords.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves stealing financial data or assets from the target.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique is used to collect information by forwarding emails to a different address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target's network or system. The question already mentions gaining credentials, which is a form of initial access. However, the question is asking what happened after gaining credentials.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target's network. Exploring financial systems fits this description.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running code or commands on the target's system. While this could be part of the process, the question is more about the exploration phase.
- **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves making changes to the target's system or data to achieve a desired outcome, such as stealing financial data. The exploration of financial systems is a precursor to this.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The cybercriminals gained system administrators' credentials, which is a form of initial access.
2. They then explored the financial systems, which is a form of discovery.
3. The next logical step would be to take action based on the information gathered, which aligns with the impact tactic.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (to gain credentials)
- Discovery (to explore financial systems)
- Impact (to steal financial data)

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after gaining credentials and exploring financial systems is Impact.

**Final Answer: D**
