Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries use Cobalt Strike to generate malicious payloads and deploy "Listeners" to configure the C2 (Command and Control) method. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely involved the deployment of "Listeners."

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.006-Python

These TTPs are all related to the Execution tactic and involve the use of PowerShell and Python as scripting interpreters.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Impact (A)**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction, or modification of data. It does not fit the context of deploying "Listeners."
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the running of code and scripts. The related TTPs mention the use of PowerShell and Python, which are consistent with the deployment of "Listeners" to configure C2 methods.
- **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This tactic is about gaining higher-level access to the system. It does not fit the context of deploying "Listeners."
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. It does not fit the context of deploying "Listeners."

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is about the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 method, which is a step in the execution of the attack.
- The related TTPs are all under the Execution tactic and involve the use of PowerShell and Python, which are consistent with the deployment of "Listeners."
- The other tactics (Impact, Privilege Escalation, and Initial Access) do not fit the context of deploying "Listeners."

### Final Answer: B: Execution
