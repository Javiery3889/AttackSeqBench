Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access is gained through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
2. The malware (BlackEnergy 3) propagates within the network.
3. Persistence is achieved by registering a binary to the startup shell.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Lateral Movement (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network.
- **Persistence (T1543.003-Windows Service)**: This tactic involves establishing a foothold that persists across reboots.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred as the malware began propagating within the network.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is already mentioned as the first step, where the vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 was exploited.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for the attacker to control the compromised system, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is a step that might occur after initial access but before propagation.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network, which aligns with the propagation of the malware within the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware gains entry through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
2. **Propagation**: The malware begins to spread within the network.
3. **Persistence**: The malware registers a binary to the startup shell to ensure it remains active after reboots.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred as the malware began propagating within the network is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer: D
