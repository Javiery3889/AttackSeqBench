Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs that occurred after the attackers implemented checks for security software to evade detection but before the SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery** - This technique involves the attackers discovering security software on the target system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying** - This technique involves the attackers using environmental keys to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and assets. While it is a plausible step after evasion and before interaction with a server, it is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or response. The related TTP mentions T1480.001-Environmental Keying, which is a technique under Defense Evasion. This suggests that the attackers are still in the process of evading detection.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It is not directly mentioned in the related TTPs and does not fit the sequence described in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attackers learning information about the target environment. The related TTP mentions T1518.001-Security Software Discovery, which is a technique under Discovery. This suggests that the attackers are still in the process of gathering information about the target environment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers first implemented checks for security software to evade detection (Defense Evasion).
- After this, they would likely continue to gather information about the target environment (Discovery) to understand the security software and other aspects of the system.
- Finally, they would use the gathered information to interact with a Mattermost server to collect system information (Collection).

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Defense Evasion to Discovery to Collection.

**Final Answer: D**
