Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Obfuscation methods are used for macro scripts to deliver a backdoor payload.
2. The PRB-Backdoor communicates with a specific URL to send and receive further commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This is directly relevant to the communication with the URL.
- **Web Protocols (Technique T1071.001):** This technique is specifically about using web protocols for command and control.
- **Execution (Tactic):** This is related to the delivery of the backdoor payload.
- **Malicious File (Technique T1204.002):** This technique is about delivering malicious files, which aligns with the obfuscation of macro scripts.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This is related to the obfuscation of the macro scripts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic is relevant to the obfuscation of the macro scripts, but it does not directly address the communication with the URL.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
  - This tactic is directly relevant to the communication with the URL, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the communication with the URL or the obfuscation of the macro scripts.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
  - This tactic is about the initial entry point into the network, which is not the final step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the final step is the communication with the URL to send and receive further commands.
- The related TTPs confirm that the Command and Control tactic is directly relevant to this communication.
- The other TTPs (Defense Evasion, Execution, and Initial Access) do not align as closely with the final step of the sequence.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
