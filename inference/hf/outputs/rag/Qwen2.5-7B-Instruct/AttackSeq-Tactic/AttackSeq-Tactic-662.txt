Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where OceanLotus delivered KerrDown to targets using malicious Office documents with macros and RAR archives containing DLL side-loading. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial delivery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about how the adversary initially compromises a system. The question mentions the initial delivery of KerrDown via malicious Office documents and RAR archives, which aligns with Initial Access.
- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. While the delivery of KerrDown and the use of DLL side-loading are part of the execution process, the question is asking about what happens after the initial delivery.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic is about the adversary developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- **Privilege Escalation (D)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question is asking about what happens immediately after the initial delivery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial delivery of KerrDown via malicious Office documents and RAR archives is a form of Initial Access.
- After the initial access, the next step would be to execute the malicious payload (KerrDown) and use DLL side-loading to maintain persistence on the system.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access has occurred, and the next step is the execution of the payload and persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
