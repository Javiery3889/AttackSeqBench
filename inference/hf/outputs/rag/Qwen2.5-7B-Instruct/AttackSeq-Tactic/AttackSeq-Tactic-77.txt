Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attacker uses API hooking techniques to modify memory functions.
2. This is followed by establishing communication with external entities through a first-stage backdoor.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which aligns with the use of API hooking.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves establishing communication with external entities, which aligns with the second part of the sequence (establishing communication with external entities).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the sequence of establishing communication with external entities.
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which is not directly related to the sequence of establishing communication with external entities.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
  - This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks, which is not directly related to the sequence of establishing communication with external entities.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**
  - This tactic involves running malicious code, which aligns with the use of API hooking techniques to modify memory functions. It is a logical step before establishing communication with external entities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves modifying memory functions using API hooking, which is a form of execution.
- After modifying memory functions, the next logical step would be to establish communication with external entities, which is a form of command and control.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is starting with execution (modifying memory functions) and then moving to command and control (establishing communication with external entities).

**Final Answer: D**
