Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already exploited public-facing applications and uploaded webshells to gain a foothold.
   - The next step in the sequence is the deployment of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target environment. The related technique is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, which aligns with the question's mention of exploiting public-facing applications.
   - **Execution (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker executing code or commands on the target system. The related technique is T1059.001-PowerShell, which could be used for command execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of custom malware for command execution.
   - Given that the attacker has already exploited public-facing applications and uploaded webshells, the next logical step would be to execute commands or code to deploy the custom malware.
   - The tactic of **Execution** (T1059.001-PowerShell) directly aligns with the deployment of custom malware for command execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred before the deployment of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution.

Final Answer: A: Execution
