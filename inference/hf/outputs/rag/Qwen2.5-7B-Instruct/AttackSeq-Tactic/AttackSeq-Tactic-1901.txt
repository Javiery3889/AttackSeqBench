Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware used 'Enigma Protector' for obfuscation.
2. Gathered basic system information.
3. Returned the results via a C&C server, eye-watch[.]in.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

#### A: Command and Control
- This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, and using a C2 channel to control a victim's system.
- The question mentions returning results via a C&C server, which aligns with this tactic.

#### B: Lateral Movement
- This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems.
- There is no indication in the question that the malware moved to other systems, so this does not fit.

#### C: Resource Development
- This tactic involves developing and maintaining resources to support the attacker's operations.
- The question does not provide information about resource development, so this does not fit.

#### D: Discovery
- This tactic involves identifying and classifying information and resources.
- While gathering basic system information is a form of discovery, the question also mentions returning results via a C&C server, which is more indicative of Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware used 'Enigma Protector' for obfuscation, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
2. It gathered basic system information, which is a form of Discovery.
3. It returned the results via a C&C server, which is a form of Command and Control.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Command and Control, as it encompasses the action of returning results via a C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
