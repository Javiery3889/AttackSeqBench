Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Whitefly uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials and compromise additional machines on the network. The next step in the sequence is to map the network and exploit vulnerabilities to gain further control over infected systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP involves moving laterally within a network by exploiting remote services.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This TTP involves gathering credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz for credential harvesting.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This TTP involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which is consistent with the use of Mimikatz.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is a tactic that involves identifying the network and its resources. While it is a necessary step, it does not directly follow the credential harvesting and network compromise described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) is a tactic that involves establishing a channel for the attacker to communicate with the compromised systems. This is not the immediate next step after credential harvesting and network compromise.
- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
  - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level access within the compromised systems. While this is a critical step, it typically follows the exploitation of vulnerabilities, which is not the immediate next step after credential harvesting.
- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. This aligns well with the next step after compromising additional machines and mapping the network. Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain further control over infected systems is a key aspect of Lateral Movement.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials and compromise additional machines on the network.
- The next step is to map the network and exploit vulnerabilities to gain further control over infected systems.
- Among the given answer choices, Lateral Movement (D) is the most plausible tactic that follows the described sequence of TTPs. It involves moving laterally within the network and exploiting vulnerabilities, which aligns with the next logical step after compromising additional machines and mapping the network.

**Final Answer: D**
