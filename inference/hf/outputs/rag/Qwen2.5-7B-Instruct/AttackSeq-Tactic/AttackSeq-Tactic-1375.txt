Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already gathered internal reconnaissance information and is now using WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations. We need to determine which tactic occurred before these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Execution, Technique: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
- **Execution, Technique: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic is about developing and maintaining the resources needed for an attack. It doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to understand the target environment. This aligns well with the internal reconnaissance mentioned in the question.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it could be a step after gathering information, it doesn't directly precede the use of WMI and custom web shells.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. While it's a necessary step, it doesn't directly precede the internal reconnaissance and the use of WMI and custom web shells.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions "internal reconnaissance and gathering information on network configurations and services." This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.
- The related TTPs mention the use of WMI and custom web shells, which are techniques used in the **Execution** tactic.
- The sequence of actions described in the question suggests that the attacker first gathers information (Discovery) and then uses the gathered information to perform more specific actions (Execution).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Discovery** occurred before the use of WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations.

### Final Answer: B
