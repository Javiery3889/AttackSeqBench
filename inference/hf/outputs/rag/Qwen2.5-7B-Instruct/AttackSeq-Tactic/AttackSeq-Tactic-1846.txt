Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Exploiting Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to access credentials such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
2. Using another Roundcube vulnerability to gather system and network information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application)
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** Credentials (Technique: T1589.001-Credentials)
- **Credential Access (Tactic):** OS Credential Dumping (Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities to access credentials** (T1003-OS Credential Dumping) is clearly a part of the Credential Access tactic.
- The next step is to use another vulnerability to gather system and network information. This action aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic, which involves gathering information to understand the target environment.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access:** The attacker initially exploits Roundcube vulnerabilities to gain access to the system.
2. **Credential Access:** The attacker then uses the Roundcube vulnerabilities to dump credentials from `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
3. **Reconnaissance:** After obtaining credentials, the attacker likely uses another vulnerability to gather system and network information, which is a common step in the Reconnaissance tactic.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (Exploit Public-Facing Application)
- Credential Access (OS Credential Dumping)
- Reconnaissance (Gathering system and network information)

### Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
