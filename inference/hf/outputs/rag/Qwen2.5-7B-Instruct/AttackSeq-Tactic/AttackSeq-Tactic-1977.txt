### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first uses a self-extracting wrapper file to conceal the Gh0st payload and then executes the embedded DLL.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing communication using a custom network protocol through a server at 98.126.67.114.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Command and Control (T1071.001-Web Protocols):** This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File):** This technique involves using encrypted or encoded files to evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027.009-Embedded Payloads):** This technique involves embedding payloads within other files to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic is about gaining higher-level access to a system, which does not directly relate to the communication aspect described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - While this tactic is mentioned in the related TTPs, it is more about the initial evasion techniques (self-extracting wrapper, embedded payloads) rather than the communication aspect.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic directly aligns with the question, as it involves establishing communication with a server for command and control purposes, which matches the custom network protocol and server address mentioned.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development** - This tactic is not relevant to the question as it pertains to developing resources or capabilities, not the communication aspect.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
