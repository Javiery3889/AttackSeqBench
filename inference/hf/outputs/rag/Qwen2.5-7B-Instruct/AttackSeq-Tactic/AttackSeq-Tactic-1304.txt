Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute malware. This implies that we need to identify the tactic that would precede the execution phase, specifically the tactic that involves initial access or the initial steps leading to the execution of the malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. However, it does not directly relate to the initial access or the deployment of a dropper.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves using a legitimate DLL to execute malicious code. This is the technique mentioned in the question, but it is the method of execution, not the initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the theft of data from a network. It is not a precursor to the deployment of a dropper.
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information from a network. While it can be part of the overall attack, it is not specifically the initial step that leads to the deployment of a dropper.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target network. This is the first step in an attack and would logically precede the deployment of a dropper.
- **Execution (D)**: This tactic involves the running of code on the target system. This is the step that follows the deployment of the dropper, not the initial step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of a dropper via DLL sideloading.
- The related TTPs do not directly provide a clear answer, but we can infer from the context that the initial access is the first step in the attack sequence.
- The deployment of a dropper via DLL sideloading is a method of execution, which follows the initial access.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access occurred before the deployment of the dropper.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
