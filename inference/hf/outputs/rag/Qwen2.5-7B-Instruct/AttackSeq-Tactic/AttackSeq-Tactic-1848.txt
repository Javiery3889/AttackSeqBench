Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. BlueDelta collected emails by automatically forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address.
2. This was followed by the exfiltration of the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique is related to the exfiltration of data, which is the last step in the sequence.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique is related to the development of resources, which could include setting up email accounts for the attacker.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique is related to the collection of emails by setting up forwarding rules.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule)**: This technique describes the process of collecting emails by forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address. This aligns with the first part of the sequence described in the question.
- **Resource Development (T1586.002-Email Accounts)**: This technique is about developing resources, which could be setting up email accounts. While it is a relevant TTP, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- **Exfiltration (T1020-Automated Exfiltration)**: This technique describes the exfiltration of data, which is the last step in the sequence. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the email collection but before the exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question is: Collection -> [Tactic] -> Exfiltration.
- The related TTPs indicate that the collection of emails is done through forwarding rules (T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule).
- The next step, which is not exfiltration, must be a tactic that involves the use of the collected data. Given the context, the most plausible tactic is "Resource Development" as it involves the use of the collected email data to further the attacker's objectives.

### Final Answer: C: Resource Development
