Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Dropper apps download exploits and payloads from the C&C server.
2. After the callCam app encrypts the collected data for transmission, a subsequent ATT&CK tactic is being asked about.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the network. It does not fit the sequence as it precedes the dropper apps downloading exploits and payloads.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems. It is not directly related to the encryption and transmission of data.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary extracting data from the network. The question mentions that the callCam app encrypted the collected data for transmission, which aligns with the exfiltration tactic.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is related to the C&C server, the question is specifically about the encryption and transmission of data, which is more closely aligned with exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The dropper apps downloading exploits and payloads from the C&C server is part of the initial infection process.
- The encryption and transmission of data by the callCam app is a form of data exfiltration.
- The related TTPs (Defense Evasion techniques) support the idea of the data being encrypted and transmitted securely, which is a common practice in exfiltration to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
