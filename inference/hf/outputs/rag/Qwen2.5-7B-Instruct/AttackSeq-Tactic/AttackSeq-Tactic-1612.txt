Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers use RC4-encrypted HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers and then upload files from infected machines.
   - The key points are:
     - RC4-encrypted HTTP requests for communication.
     - C&C servers are involved.
     - Files are uploaded from infected machines.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (T1083)**
     - **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
     - **Technique: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using symmetric cryptography (like RC4) for secure communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic is about gaining higher-level access to a system. While it might be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the communication and file upload process.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic directly involves maintaining access to the target network and controlling the target systems. The use of RC4-encrypted HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers and the uploading of files are clear indicators of Command and Control activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. While it might be a part of the overall attack, the question is specifically about the communication and file upload process, not the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the removal of data from the target network. While the question mentions uploading files, the primary focus is on the communication and control aspect rather than the data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.
   - The use of RC4-encrypted HTTP requests for communication with C&C servers and the uploading of files are clear indicators of Command and Control activities.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
