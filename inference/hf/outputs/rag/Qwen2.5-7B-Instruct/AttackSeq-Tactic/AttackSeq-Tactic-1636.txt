Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an actor uses spear-phishing emails with URLs linking to RAR files or malicious Microsoft Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to deliver NetTraveler. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial phase.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a spear-phishing email to gain initial access to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target system. The question already mentions the initial access via spear-phishing emails, so this is not the next step.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it typically occurs after the initial access and the execution of the payload.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. This is a step that follows the initial execution of the payload and gaining control.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker learning about the target's environment and identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities. This is usually a step that occurs after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments (T1566.001) are used to gain initial access to the system.
2. The payload (NetTraveler) is executed, likely exploiting a vulnerability (T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution).
3. After gaining access and executing the payload, the next logical step is to establish persistence to maintain control over the system.
4. Discovery would come after persistence to understand the environment better, but it is not the immediate next step after the initial execution of the payload.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access and execution of the payload is persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
