Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2019-13720) is exploited.
2. This leads to a Use-After-Free condition for arbitrary read/write access.
3. The next step is the installation of tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This indicates that the malware is using scheduled tasks for persistence.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This suggests that the malware might be trying to escalate privileges, but it is not directly relevant to the sequence described in the question.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**: This is similar to the persistence tactic but is listed under execution, indicating that the scheduled task is part of the execution phase.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the initial steps of running the malware or payload. However, the question specifies that the zero-day exploit and arbitrary read/write access have already occurred, so execution is not the next step.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves ensuring the malware remains on the system after initial compromise. The question explicitly mentions that tasks are installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection or response by the defender. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not the next step after the zero-day exploit and arbitrary read/write access.
- **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. The question does not mention any data exfiltration, so this is not the next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The zero-day exploit and arbitrary read/write access are part of the initial compromise and execution phase.
- The next step, as described in the question, is the installation of tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence.
- This aligns perfectly with the Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task.

### Final Answer: B
