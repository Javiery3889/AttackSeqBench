Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - They then exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after gaining credentials and before exporting data.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Credential Access" as a tactic, which aligns with the initial action of gaining domain administrator credentials.
   - The techniques mentioned are:
     - T1003.003-NTDS (related to accessing NTDS.dit files, which are used to export data from Active Directory).
     - T1003.006-DCSync (a technique used to export data from Active Directory).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic is directly related to the initial action of gaining domain administrator credentials.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - While reconnaissance might be involved, it is not the immediate next step after gaining credentials.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding detection, which is not the next step after gaining credentials.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data, which is the action that follows gaining credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions is: Initial Access -> Credential Access -> Collection.
   - APT15 first gained domain administrator credentials (Credential Access).
   - The next logical step would be to use these credentials to collect data from the network (Collection).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D
