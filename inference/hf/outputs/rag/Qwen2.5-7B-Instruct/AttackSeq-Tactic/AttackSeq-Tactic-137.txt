Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **FamousSparrow** executed **SparrowDoor** on compromised systems using **cmd.exe** and **vulnerabilities**.
- This was followed by an attempt to **evade detection** by **injecting the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes**.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid being detected or analyzed by security tools.
- **Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute it.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **SparrowDoor** execution using **cmd.exe** and **vulnerabilities** suggests an initial compromise and execution of malware.
- **Process Injection** (injecting **MpSvc.dll** into processes) is a technique used to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** the execution of **SparrowDoor** but **before** the process injection.

### Step 4: Reasoning
- **Persistence** (Tactic: Persistence) is a common tactic that follows initial compromise and execution of malware. It involves maintaining access to the system over time.
- **Discovery** (Tactic: Discovery) involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, which is more aligned with the initial compromise phase.
- **Resource Development** (Tactic: Resource Development) is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.

Given the sequence of actions:
1. Initial compromise and execution of malware (SparrowDoor).
2. Persistence (maintaining access).
3. Evasion (process injection).

The most plausible tactic that fits the sequence and occurs after the initial execution but before evasion is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
