Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before WINDSHIFT sent emails mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset requests to harvest credentials. This implies that the tactic should precede the spearphishing attack (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique is directly related to the spearphishing attack mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves the attacker gaining access to email accounts, which could be a precursor to sending spearphishing emails.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spearphishing attachment, which is a different method from the spearphishing link mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to other systems. It is not directly related to the spearphishing attack described.
- **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a network or system. While it could be a result of the spearphishing attack, it is not the most likely precursor.
- **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. It is a logical step before sending spearphishing emails, as the attacker would need to understand the target's environment and possibly their email habits.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a network or system. While it is a necessary step, it is more about the entry point rather than the preparation for the spearphishing attack.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spearphishing attack (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link) is the final step in the sequence.
- The attacker would need to gather information about the target (Reconnaissance) before crafting the spearphishing emails.
- Gaining access to email accounts (T1586.002-Email Accounts) is a relevant technique but not a tactic.
- Initial access (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is a different method and not directly related to the spearphishing link mentioned.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the spearphishing attack is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
