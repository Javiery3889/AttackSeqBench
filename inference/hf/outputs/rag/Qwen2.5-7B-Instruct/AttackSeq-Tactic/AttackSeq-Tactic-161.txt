Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The Jupyter infostealer avoided triggering alerts by copying stolen information to another directory.
2. The infostealer used obfuscation patterns to evade detection.
3. The infostealer targeted and collected data from Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browsers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**: This technique involves stealing credentials from web browsers.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the browser itself, which is a precursor to stealing credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred after the infostealer avoided detection and before it collected data from browsers.

- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering and aggregating data. Since the infostealer is described as targeting and collecting data from browsers, this is likely the final step in the sequence.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves transferring data out of the network. While this could be a step after collection, the question does not explicitly mention exfiltration.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection or response. The question already mentions that the infostealer avoided detection, so this is not the next step.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another. There is no indication in the question that the infostealer moved to another system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The infostealer avoided detection by copying stolen information to another directory and using obfuscation.
2. The next step would be to gather information about the browser, which is a precursor to stealing credentials.
3. After gathering browser information, the infostealer would then steal credentials from the browsers.
4. The final step would be to collect and aggregate the stolen data.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred after avoiding detection and before collecting data from browsers is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
