Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. FastPOS's RAM scraper verified credit card information.
2. Cards were ensured to be suitable for international use.
3. The stolen data was transmitted to a hardcoded server using GET commands over unencrypted communication.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Collection (T1005)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the local system.
- **Exfiltration (T1041, T1048.003)**: This tactic involves transmitting data out of the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the data was exfiltrated (transmitted) over an unencrypted channel.

- **Exfiltration (T1041, T1048.003)**: This is the final step where data is transmitted. The question already mentions this step.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It is not directly related to the data transmission step.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker controlling the compromised system. It is not directly related to the data transmission step.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. It is not directly related to the data transmission step.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Collection (T1005)**: The RAM scraper verifies and ensures the credit card information is suitable for international use. This is a form of data collection.
2. **Exfiltration (T1041, T1048.003)**: The data is then transmitted to a hardcoded server using GET commands over unencrypted communication.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the data was exfiltrated is **Collection**.

### Final Answer: A: Collection
