Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Collecting information from the iOS device (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data).
2. Exfiltrating this data via HTTP.
3. Receiving commands from the attacker.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network or system.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the initial collection of information from the iOS device.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the exfiltration via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in future attacks. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly align with the exfiltration and command and control aspects described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the establishment and maintenance of the interaction between an attacker and a compromised system. The question mentions receiving commands from the attacker, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of resources to support the attack, such as tools and infrastructure. It does not directly align with the exfiltration and command and control aspects.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While it is part of the initial phase, it does not directly align with the exfiltration and command and control aspects.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection of data from the iOS device, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic.
- The data is then exfiltrated via HTTP, which aligns with the **Exfiltration** tactic.
- The attacker receives commands, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the **Command and Control** tactic, as it directly involves the interaction between the attacker and the compromised system, including receiving commands and maintaining the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
