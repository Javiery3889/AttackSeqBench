Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a threat actor gains entry via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents. These documents then download base64-encoded CAB files through embedded scripts. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context about the initial access method:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves phishing via a link.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves phishing via an attachment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Given the scenario in the question, the threat actor used a spear phishing attachment (T1566.001) to gain initial access. The next steps in the attack sequence would logically be the execution of the malicious document and the download of the base64-encoded CAB files.

- **A: Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data loss or system compromise. It is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts. After gaining initial access, the next step would be to execute the malicious document and download the CAB files.
- **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the theft of data from the target. It is a later step in the attack sequence, not immediately after gaining initial access.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about the initial entry into the target environment. The question already states that initial access has occurred, so this is not the next step.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actor gained initial access via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents (T1566.001).
2. The next logical step is the execution of the malicious document, which would involve running the embedded scripts to download the base64-encoded CAB files.
3. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access is the execution of the malicious document.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
