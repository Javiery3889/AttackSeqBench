Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the initial step is evading defenses using DLL side-loading.
   - The next step in the sequence is to allow PKPLUG to communicate with and control compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Defense Evasion" and the technique "T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading."
   - This confirms that DLL side-loading is a method used for Defense Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. While it is a common follow-up to initial access and evasion, it does not directly address the communication and control aspect.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding or reducing the detection of the attacker's actions. DLL side-loading is a specific technique under this tactic, but it does not directly address the communication and control aspect.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the communication and control aspect described in the question.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing, operating, and maintaining channels that allow an attacker to control a victim's system. It directly addresses the communication and control aspect of the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.
   - Final Answer: D: Command and Control
