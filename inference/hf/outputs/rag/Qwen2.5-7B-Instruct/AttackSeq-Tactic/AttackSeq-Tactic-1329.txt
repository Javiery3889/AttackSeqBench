Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the first step in the attack sequence before achieving execution through the callCam app and after employing camouflaged malicious apps on Google Play. This implies that the first step should be related to how the attacker initially gains access to the system or how the malicious app is delivered.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link to execute code. However, this is not the first step but rather a technique used for execution.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection. Again, this is not the first step but a technique used to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**: Exfiltration is the process of transferring data from one network to another. This is not typically the first step in an attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is also not the first step in the attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**: Execution is the act of running code or a program. This is not the first step but a later step in the attack sequence.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: Initial access is the first step in the attack sequence where the attacker gains a foothold in the target environment. This could involve techniques such as phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or using malicious apps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attack sequence involves employing camouflaged malicious apps on Google Play. This indicates that the first step is likely to be gaining access to the system or delivering the malicious app.
- Among the given choices, "Initial Access" (Answer Choice D) is the most plausible first step because it encompasses the method of gaining access to the system, which could include delivering a malicious app on Google Play.

### Final Answer: D
