Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible final step in the attack sequence.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that the attackers have already collected and prepared valuable documents related to internal applications and procedures. The final step in the attack sequence is being asked for.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection Tactic**: 
  - **T1213.001-Confluence**: This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating data from Confluence, a collaborative document management platform.
  - **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the collection of internal documents.
- **Reconnaissance Tactic**: 
  - **T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is a preparatory step for accessing systems but not the final step in the sequence described.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic is about identifying the network and systems, which is not the final step after collecting and preparing documents.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target to the attacker's location. Given that the attackers have already collected valuable documents, the next logical step would be to transfer this data to the attacker.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target network or system. This is typically the first step, not the final step.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is important, it is not the final step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already collected and prepared valuable documents.
- The final step in the sequence would logically be to transfer this data to the attacker, which is the definition of the Exfiltration tactic.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1213.001-Confluence and T1005-Data from Local System, support the idea of collecting and transferring data.

### Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
