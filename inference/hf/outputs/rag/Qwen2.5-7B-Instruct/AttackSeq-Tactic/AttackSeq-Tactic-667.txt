Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Dexphot:
1. Loaded executables into system processes via process hollowing.
2. Employed multiple layers of security evasion such as fileless techniques and obfuscated batch scripts.

We need to identify the tactic that occurred after the process hollowing but before the defense evasion.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide the following information:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (Answer Choice D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference from security controls. It aligns with the description of employing multiple layers of security evasion such as fileless techniques and obfuscated batch scripts.
- **Privilege Escalation (Answer Choice C)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it is a common tactic, it does not directly align with the sequence described in the question.
- **Impact (Answer Choice A)**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. It is not a precursor to defense evasion.
- **Reconnaissance (Answer Choice B)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where Dexphot first uses process hollowing to load executables into system processes.
- After this, the next step is to employ multiple layers of security evasion.
- The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion as the tactic that includes techniques like fileless techniques and obfuscated batch scripts, which align with the described security evasion methods.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the tactic of Defense Evasion occurred after the process hollowing but before the multiple layers of security evasion.

**Final Answer: D**
