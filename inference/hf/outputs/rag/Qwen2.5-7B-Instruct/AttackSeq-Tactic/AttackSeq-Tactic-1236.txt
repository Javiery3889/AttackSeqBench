### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already gained initial access to servers V1 and V2 using backdoors.
   - The attacker then uses BPF and RSA algorithms to establish a covert communication channel.
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred during the transfer of sensitive operations via V2's SMB service.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Lateral Movement (T1570):** This tactic involves moving laterally within the network from one system to another. The related technique T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares suggests the use of SMB (Server Message Block) and Windows admin shares for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control (T1071):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to control the compromised system. The related technique T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols suggests the use of file transfer protocols for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding detection by the defender. While it could be relevant in the overall attack sequence, it does not directly address the transfer of sensitive operations via V2's SMB service.
   - **Option B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources. It is not directly related to the transfer of sensitive operations via SMB.
   - **Option C: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or disruption. While it could be a result of the transfer of sensitive operations, it does not directly describe the action of transferring the operations.
   - **Option D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. The related technique T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares directly aligns with the use of V2's SMB service for transferring sensitive operations.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: D**
