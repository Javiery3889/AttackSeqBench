Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Earth Wendigo established a WebSocket connection.
2. The WebSocket connection was used to control a JavaScript backdoor.
3. The backdoor was used to read emails from a webmail server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target network.
- **Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **Tactic: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system.
- **Technique: T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves using JavaScript to execute malicious code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the related TTPs:

- **A: Command and Control**
  - The WebSocket connection and the use of JavaScript to control the backdoor align with the Command and Control tactic. The WebSocket connection is a web protocol used for command and control, and the JavaScript backdoor is a method of maintaining persistence and control over the target system.
  
- **B: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question. Resource Development involves the adversary developing tools and resources, which is not the focus of the described sequence of actions.

- **C: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the target network. The question does not mention moving to another system, so this tactic does not fit the described sequence.

- **D: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. While reading emails from the webmail server is a data collection activity, the question does not explicitly state that the data is being exfiltrated. The WebSocket connection and JavaScript backdoor are more directly related to maintaining control and execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The WebSocket connection and the use of JavaScript to control the backdoor are directly related to the Command and Control tactic.
- The question describes maintaining access and control over the target system, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- The other options do not fit the described sequence of actions as well as Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
