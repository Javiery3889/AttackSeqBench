Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents such as .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, and .PPT files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This TTP is about the attacker discovering files and directories on the target system.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP involves the attacker using a spearphishing attachment to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that describes the method used to gain initial access to the target system. The question mentions that the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents. This directly aligns with the T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment TTP.
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another. It is not relevant to the initial phase of gaining access.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker discovering information about the target system. While this could be a step in the process, it is not the first step in gaining initial access.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Like Discovery, it is a preparatory step but not the first step in gaining initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking for the tactic that occurred before the initial access, which is the step where the attackers exploited vulnerabilities using malicious documents.
- The related TTPs provide context that the spearphishing attachment (T1566.001) is a method of gaining initial access.
- The Discovery TTP (T1083) is a step that could occur after gaining initial access but not before.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained before the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
