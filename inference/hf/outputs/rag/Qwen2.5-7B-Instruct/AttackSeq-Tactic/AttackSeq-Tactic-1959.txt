Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where KiraV2 exploits vulnerabilities in IoT devices to execute DDoS attacks and distribute itself to other IoT devices. The key part of the question is identifying which tactic most likely occurred when exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices such as MVPower DVR and Huawei routers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly relevant to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in IoT devices.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target network or system. Exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices to gain access fits this description.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running code or programs on the target system. After gaining access, the next step would be to execute the malicious code.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. This would occur after the initial access and execution of the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **C: Initial Access**: This is the most logical step when exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices. The malware (KiraV2) would need to gain access to the devices before it can execute any malicious code.
- **A: Execution**: This would follow initial access, but the question specifically asks about the tactic that most likely occurred when exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the target and its vulnerabilities. While it is a necessary step, the question is more focused on the exploitation phase.
- **D: Lateral Movement**: This would occur after the initial access and execution, but not during the exploitation phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking about the tactic that most likely occurred when exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the devices is the initial step in the attack sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible tactic is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
