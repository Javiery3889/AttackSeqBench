Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Iranian hackers used spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages on social media to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, they harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs are all under the "Initial Access" tactic, which aligns with the initial phase of the attack.
   - The techniques mentioned are:
     - T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
     - T1566-Phishing
     - T1566.002-Spearphishing Link

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access but before harvesting credentials.
   - The related TTPs are all part of the "Initial Access" tactic, so we need to look at the sequence of actions within this tactic.
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages on social media (gaining initial access).
     2. Harvesting corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The tactic that occurs after gaining initial access but before harvesting credentials is likely to be related to the exploitation of the initial access to gain further privileges or information.
   - In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactic that best fits this description is "Credential Access" (T1078), as it involves the exploitation of the initial access to gain credentials.

Final Answer: C: Credential Access
