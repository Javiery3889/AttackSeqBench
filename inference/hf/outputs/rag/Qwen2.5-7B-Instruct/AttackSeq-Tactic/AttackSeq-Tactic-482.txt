Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Stuxnet utilized two zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges on infected systems.
2. After privilege escalation, the worm propagated laterally through networks by exploiting other vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique is related to the propagation of the worm laterally through networks.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique is related to the initial step of exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This tactic is about how an adversary first gains a foothold in a network. The question does not describe the initial access but rather the steps after initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about techniques used to avoid detection. The question does not focus on evasion but on the sequence of actions after initial compromise.
- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic is about gaining higher levels of access within the network. The question mentions that Stuxnet utilized zero-day vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within the network. The question states that the worm propagated laterally after privilege escalation, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions where Stuxnet first exploits vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges (Privilege Escalation) and then uses those privileges to propagate laterally (Lateral Movement).
- The related TTPs confirm that T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) is a technique used in the Privilege Escalation tactic, and T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) is a technique used in the Lateral Movement tactic.
- The sequence in the question (Privilege Escalation -> Lateral Movement) matches the order of the techniques described in the related TTPs.

### Final Answer: C
