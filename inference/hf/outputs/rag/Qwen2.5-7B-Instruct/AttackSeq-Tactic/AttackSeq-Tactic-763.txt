Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Network reconnaissance is performed to identify vulnerable systems and gather information.
2. Stolen credentials and exploitation of CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) are used to traverse the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network.
- **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)**: This technique involves exploiting a service to gain access to a system.
- **SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002)**: This technique involves using administrative shares to gain access to a system.
- **Credentials (T1589.001)**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to gain access to a system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the use of stolen credentials and exploitation of EternalBlue to traverse the network.

- **Discovery (T1040)**: This tactic involves identifying the network and its resources, which aligns with the network reconnaissance described in the question.
- **Lateral Movement (T1578)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another, which is what happens after gaining access to a system.
- **Command and Control (T1048)**: This tactic involves establishing a means to control a compromised system, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **Impact (T1486)**: This tactic involves causing harm or damage, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

Given the sequence described, the most logical step before using stolen credentials and exploiting EternalBlue to traverse the network is the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker identifies and gathers information about the network and its systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence starting with network reconnaissance.
2. The related TTPs confirm that reconnaissance (Discovery) is a key step.
3. After reconnaissance, the attacker would likely use stolen credentials and exploit EternalBlue to move laterally within the network.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Reconnaissance (Discovery)**
- **Use stolen credentials and exploit EternalBlue for Lateral Movement**

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
