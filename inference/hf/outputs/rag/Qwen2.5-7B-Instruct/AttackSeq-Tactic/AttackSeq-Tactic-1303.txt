Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The OceanLotus Group used a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook for command execution and data exfiltration.
   - They utilized HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Techniques include T1572-Protocol Tunneling and T1071.004-DNS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions command execution and data exfiltration, which are actions typically associated with the **Exfiltration** and **Command and Control** tactics.
   - The use of HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control aligns with the related TTPs T1572-Protocol Tunneling and T1071.004-DNS.
   - The question asks which tactic most likely occurred after the initial use of the backdoor for command execution and data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The OceanLotus Group first used the backdoor for command execution and data exfiltration.
   - After the initial actions, the next step would be to maintain control and continue to exfiltrate data.
   - The use of HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control is a method of maintaining a C2 channel, which is a tactic that follows the initial actions of command execution and data exfiltration.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial command execution and data exfiltration, the OceanLotus Group would maintain control through a C2 channel.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial actions is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
