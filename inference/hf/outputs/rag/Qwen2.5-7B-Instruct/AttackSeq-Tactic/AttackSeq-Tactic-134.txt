Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. FamousSparrow acquired domains and servers from Hosting Concepts and Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology.
2. The next step is to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to gain access to victim systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the target's network and systems. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly relate to the acquisition of domains and servers or the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or systems. The acquisition of domains and servers and the subsequent exploitation of vulnerabilities align closely with this tactic.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the infrastructure used for the attack. While it is relevant to the acquisition of domains and servers, it does not directly describe the next step of exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels to control compromised systems. This is a later step in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The acquisition of domains and servers (T1090) is a form of Initial Access (T1190), as it is the method by which the adversary gains a foothold in the target's network.
- The exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain access to victim systems (T1190) is the next step in the attack sequence.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after acquiring domains and servers but before exploiting vulnerabilities is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: B**
