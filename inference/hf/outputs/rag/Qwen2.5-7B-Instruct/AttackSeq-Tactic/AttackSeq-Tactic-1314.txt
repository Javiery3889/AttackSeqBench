Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT module is loaded into memory, and the next step is communication with the C&C server to receive commands and send collected data. We need to identify the tactic that occurs between these two steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about the tactics and techniques involved in the attack sequence:
- **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the process of transferring data from a network or system to an external location.
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated process of exfiltrating data.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. It does not directly relate to the data collection or exfiltration process.
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It is a logical step after the RAT module is loaded into memory and before exfiltration.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is not directly related to the data collection or exfiltration process.
- **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target system. It is the final step in the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The RAT module is loaded into memory, which is part of the initial infection process.
- The next step is to collect data from the system, which is a logical and necessary step before exfiltration.
- Exfiltration involves sending the collected data to the C&C server, which is the final step in the sequence.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the RAT module is loaded into memory and before it communicates with the C&C server to receive commands and send collected data is **Collection**.

### Final Answer: B
