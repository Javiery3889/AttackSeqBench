Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
2. Automatically exfiltrating files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data locally before exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automating the exfiltration process.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data remotely before exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is not directly related to the actions described in the question. Discovery typically involves identifying and locating assets or systems, which is not the focus here.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
  - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the same network. This is not directly related to the described actions of enumerating data and exfiltrating files.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Impact**
  - Impact typically involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. While exfiltration can be seen as a form of impact, the question is more focused on the preparatory actions leading to exfiltration.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information or data. The question describes enumerating data directories and gathering system information, which aligns with the Collection tactic. The subsequent exfiltration of files also fits within the Exfiltration tactic, but the question asks which tactic occurred before the exfiltration.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial actions of enumerating data directories and gathering system information, which are clearly part of the Collection tactic.
- The subsequent exfiltration of files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections is part of the Exfiltration tactic.
- Therefore, the Collection tactic logically precedes the Exfiltration tactic in the sequence of actions described.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
