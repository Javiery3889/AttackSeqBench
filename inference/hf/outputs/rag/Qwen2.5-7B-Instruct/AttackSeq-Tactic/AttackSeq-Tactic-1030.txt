Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first deliver phishing messages through various communication channels (email, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram) before obtaining Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials via phishing sites. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred first in this sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide specific details about the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566-Phishing**
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598-Phishing for Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information from various sources. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not the initial step in delivering phishing messages.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's environment. The related TTPs mention techniques like spearphishing via service and phishing, which align with the initial delivery of phishing messages.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials from the target. The question states that the attackers obtained Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials via phishing sites, which is a step that occurs after the initial access.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the target's defenses. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it is not the initial step in delivering phishing messages.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers first need to deliver phishing messages to the targets through various communication channels.
- The related TTPs specifically mention techniques for delivering phishing messages, which fall under the **Initial Access** tactic.
- The subsequent step would be to obtain the credentials via the phishing sites, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used the **Initial Access** tactic to deliver phishing messages.

**Final Answer: B**
