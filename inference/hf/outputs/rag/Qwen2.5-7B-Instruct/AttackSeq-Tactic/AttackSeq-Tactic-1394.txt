Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions APT10 using dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for interconnected command and control infrastructure. This indicates that the attackers are establishing a robust and flexible communication channel to maintain control over their targets.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH**: This suggests that the attackers are using SSH for lateral movement, which is a method of moving between systems within a network.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This indicates that the attackers are using dynamic DNS resolution to maintain a flexible and resilient command and control infrastructure.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
  - This aligns well with the use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for command and control infrastructure.
  - The related TTPs also support this, as T1568-Dynamic Resolution is directly related to maintaining a command and control infrastructure.
- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
  - While credential access is a common tactic in many attacks, the question specifically mentions command and control infrastructure, which is more directly related to the TTPs provided.
- **Answer Choice C: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering data, which is not directly mentioned in the question. The focus is on maintaining control and communication.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying and enumerating systems and networks, which is a preliminary step rather than the maintenance of command and control infrastructure.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools for command and control infrastructure.
- The related TTPs mention dynamic resolution and SSH for command and control.
- Among the answer choices, Command and Control (A) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the described TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
