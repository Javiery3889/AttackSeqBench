Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of additional modules like pr.dll for targeted data collection.
2. Exfiltration of emails and files such as .pst and .dbx to a central server.
3. Facilitating encrypted communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target network. The related technique T1571-Non-Standard Port indicates the use of non-standard ports for communication.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target network. The related technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel suggests that the exfiltration is done over a command and control channel.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the deployment of pr.dll for data collection is part of this, the question focuses on the communication and exfiltration aspects.
- **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves the actual transfer of data. The question mentions exfiltrating emails and files, which aligns with this tactic. However, the question also mentions facilitating encrypted communication, which is more closely related to Command and Control.
- **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves stealing credentials. The question does not mention any credential theft, so this is not relevant.
- **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target network. The question mentions facilitating encrypted communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic and the related technique T1571-Non-Standard Port.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the deployment of modules for data collection, which is part of the Collection tactic.
- The exfiltration of data (emails and files) is part of the Exfiltration tactic.
- The facilitation of encrypted communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80 is a key aspect of maintaining access and communication, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is facilitated by the Command and Control tactic, as it encompasses the encrypted communication aspect.

**Final Answer: D**
