Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with initial access through spearphishing with malicious PDF files.
   - The next step is the injection of code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (Tactic):** This is not directly related to the injection of code into "explorer.exe."
   - **Execution (Tactic):** This is relevant as it involves running or executing code.
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This is also relevant as it involves techniques to avoid detection, such as process injection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step and is already covered by the spearphishing with malicious PDF files.
   - **Collection (B):** This typically involves gathering data, which is not the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Execution (C):** This is the most relevant tactic as it involves running or executing the code that was injected into "explorer.exe."
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This involves transferring data out of the network, which is not the next step after the injection of code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence starting with initial access.
   - The next step is the execution of the malicious code, which is the injection of code into "explorer.exe."
   - The related TTPs confirm that process injection (T1055-Process Injection) is a technique under the Execution tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
