Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Adversary obtained SSH access.
2. Used `wget` to fetch malware samples.
3. Deployed the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk.
4. Hidden the deployed kernel module from detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This technique involves deploying a kernel module to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using SSH to gain access to a system.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1014-Rootkit**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, or registry entries from detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The question mentions SSH access, which is a form of initial access. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after obtaining SSH access and before deploying the kernel module.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. The question mentions using `wget` to fetch malware samples, which is a form of execution. However, this is not the final step before deploying the kernel module.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing and preparing resources for an attack. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While it can be part of initial access, it does not fit the sequence described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The adversary has already obtained SSH access (Lateral Movement).
- The adversary then uses `wget` to fetch malware samples (Execution).
- The next step is to deploy the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk (Persistence).
- Finally, the kernel module is hidden from detection (Defense Evasion).

Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after obtaining SSH access and before deploying the kernel module is Execution.

### Final Answer: B
