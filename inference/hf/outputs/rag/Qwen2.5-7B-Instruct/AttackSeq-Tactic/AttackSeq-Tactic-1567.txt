Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Konni APT:
1. Leveraging obfuscated scripts to manage the deletion of evidence (e.g., 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs').
2. Using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or interference from defensive measures. The obfuscation of scripts and the deletion of evidence are clear examples of Defense Evasion.
- **File Deletion (Technique)**: This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks or remove evidence of the attack.

Given the sequence of actions:
1. The first action is the deletion of evidence, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic and the T1070.004-File Deletion technique.
2. The second action is the use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details, which is a Discovery action.

### Step 4: Determine the Plausible Sequence
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the deletion of evidence and before using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details. Based on the provided information:
- The deletion of evidence (T1070.004-File Deletion) is a Defense Evasion tactic.
- The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details is a Discovery tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence is:
1. Defense Evasion (T1070.004-File Deletion)
2. Discovery (using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details)

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
