Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **BlackEnergy 3 malware** gathered local network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` function API.
- This information was then sent to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering network configuration information.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves destroying data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Gathering Local Network Information**: This action aligns with the **Discovery** tactic and the **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** technique.
- **Sending Data to Servers**: This action aligns with the **Collection** tactic and the **T1005-Data from Local System** technique.

Given the sequence of actions:
1. **Gathering Local Network Information** (Discovery -> T1016)
2. **Sending Data to Servers** (Collection -> T1005)

The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to use the collected information to establish a **Command and Control** channel, which is the process of communicating with the servers to control the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: BlackEnergy 3 malware gathers local network information (Discovery -> T1016).
- **Step 2**: The malware sends this information to servers (Collection -> T1005).
- **Step 3**: The next logical step is to establish a **Command and Control** channel to communicate with the servers and control the malware.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
