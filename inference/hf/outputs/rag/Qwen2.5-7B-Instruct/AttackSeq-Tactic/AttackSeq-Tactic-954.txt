Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document.**
- **This was followed by a tactic and then techniques T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth.**

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **SWEED's initial action (exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document) is a form of exploitation, which aligns with the T1203 technique.**
- **The next step is a tactic, and then specific techniques (T1107 and T1045).**
- **T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) are both techniques under the Defense Evasion tactic.**

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Exploitation:** SWEED exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) using a hidden object in an Excel document. This aligns with the T1203 technique under the Execution tactic.
2. **Next Tactic:** After the initial exploitation, the next tactic is likely to be Defense Evasion, as it involves techniques like file deletion and software packing.
3. **Techniques:** T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) are both techniques under the Defense Evasion tactic.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the tactic after the initial exploitation is Defense Evasion, followed by the techniques T1107 and T1045.

Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
