Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Deployment of njRAT malware with specific victim IDs.
2. Utilization of GoLang-based file recon plugins to collect Kavach authentication databases.
3. Extensive use of modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
- **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the modular plugins were extensively used for credential harvesting and browser password stealing.

- **Impact (A)**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data loss, system damage, or other negative consequences. It does not fit the sequence of actions described.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the methods an attacker uses to initially gain access to a network or system. It does not fit the sequence of actions described, as the initial access has already occurred.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the process of transferring data from the target system to the attacker. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the credential harvesting and browser password stealing.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the methods an attacker uses to communicate with the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it is not directly related to the credential harvesting and browser password stealing.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible tactic that follows the extensive use of modular plugins for credential harvesting and browser password stealing is **Credential Access**. This is because the credential harvesting and browser password stealing are directly related to the tactic of gaining unauthorized access to credentials.

**Final Answer: C**
