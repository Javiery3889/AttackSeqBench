Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Emissary Panda installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the actors used tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1588.002-Tool**: This suggests that the actors developed or used tools for their operations.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This indicates that the actors used webshells for maintaining access.
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This suggests that the actors transferred tools to pivot to other systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
  - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is a step that can be part of the overall attack but is not directly related to the pivot using tools like Mimikatz.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves avoiding detection, which is also a part of the overall attack but does not directly relate to the pivot using tools.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
  - This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which could be a precursor to using tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying resources and systems within the network, which is also a precursor to using tools to pivot to additional systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the pivot to additional systems using tools like Mimikatz. This action is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.
- Before using Mimikatz, the actors would need to have gathered information about the network and identified systems to pivot to. This aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- The installation of webshells for persistence is part of the Persistence tactic and does not directly precede the use of Mimikatz for pivoting.
- The development of tools and their transfer are part of the Resource Development and Lateral Movement tactics, respectively, but do not directly precede the use of Mimikatz for pivoting.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
