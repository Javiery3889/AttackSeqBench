Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15:
1. Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. Privilege escalation.
3. Enabled a RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Privilege Escalation (T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control)**: This tactic involves techniques to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to gain higher privileges.
- **Defense Evasion (T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control)**: This tactic involves techniques to evade detection and defenses, including bypassing UAC.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques to evade detection and defenses. Enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution is a form of defense evasion because it helps the attackers to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
- **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic involves gaining higher privileges. While privilege escalation is a prerequisite for enabling the backdoor, the question specifically asks about the tactic that follows enabling the backdoor.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources. Discovery is not directly related to enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering information and data. While collection might be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to enabling the backdoor to bypass policy settings.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves gaining domain administrator credentials, privilege escalation, and then enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings.
- The backdoor enabling step is a form of defense evasion because it helps the attackers to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows enabling the backdoor to bypass policy settings is Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
