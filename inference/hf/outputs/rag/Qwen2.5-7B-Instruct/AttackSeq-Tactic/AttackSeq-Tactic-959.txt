Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**

These TTPs all fall under the Command and Control tactic, but they specify different protocols (application layer, web protocols, and non-application layer).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about the initial entry into the target network, which has already occurred as the credentials were stolen.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves the theft of data from the target network, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining access to the target network, which aligns with the stolen credentials being sent to a C2 server.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials, which has already happened according to the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question mentions that stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols. This action is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
- The related TTPs confirm that the Command and Control tactic is relevant and that application layer protocols are used in this context.
- The other answer choices do not fit the sequence of events described in the question.

### Final Answer: C
