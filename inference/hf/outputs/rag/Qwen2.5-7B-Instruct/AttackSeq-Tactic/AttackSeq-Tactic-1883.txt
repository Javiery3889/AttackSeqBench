Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The first TTP involves Shellbot assigning hardcoded process names to evade detection by system admins.
2. The second TTP is the botnet establishing communication with the C&C servers using an IRC channel.

We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: Techniques include T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1071.004-DNS.
- **Discovery (Tactic)**: Technique T1057-Process Discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Discovery (Tactic)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to better understand the network and the systems within it. The technique T1057-Process Discovery is relevant here, as it involves identifying and classifying processes to evade detection.
- **Command and Control (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and using the means to direct the compromised system to perform actions as part of the adversary campaign. Techniques like T1071-Application Layer Protocol and T1071.004-DNS are related to this tactic.

Given the sequence:
1. The first step is the bot performing process discovery to evade detection.
2. The second step is the bot establishing communication with the C&C servers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The process discovery (T1057-Process Discovery) is a logical step before the bot establishes communication with the C&C servers. This is because the bot needs to understand the environment and identify processes to evade detection before it can communicate with the C&C servers.
- The Command and Control tactic (T1071) involves the communication with the C&C servers, which happens after the bot has gathered enough information to evade detection.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Discovery (T1057-Process Discovery)
2. Command and Control (T1071)

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Discovery
