Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where APT15:
1. Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. Facilitated further actions within the network.
3. Installed the RoyalDNS backdoor persistently on the victim's network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: Technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts (likely related to gaining domain administrator credentials).
- **Persistence**: Technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts (likely related to maintaining access).
- **Defense Evasion**: Technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts (likely related to evading detection).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after gaining domain administrator credentials and before the RoyalDNS backdoor was installed persistently.

- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic is about establishing a channel to control the compromised system. It typically occurs after gaining access and before persistence.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system over time. It occurs after gaining access and before the backdoor is installed.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic is about running code or commands on the target system. It could occur after gaining access but before persistence.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target. It typically occurs at the beginning of the attack, not after gaining access and before persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gaining Domain Administrator Credentials**: This is the initial access.
2. **Facilitating Further Actions**: This likely involves execution or command and control to move laterally within the network.
3. **Installing RoyalDNS Backdoor Persistently**: This is the persistence tactic.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurs after gaining domain administrator credentials and before the RoyalDNS backdoor is installed persistently is **Command and Control**. This is because command and control is about establishing a channel to control the compromised system, which is a necessary step before installing a backdoor.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
