Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. KONNI executed arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
2. The next step was evolving its dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: This technique involves the execution of malicious files.
- **Defense Evasion (T1036-Masquerading)**: This technique involves hiding the malicious activity or the malicious files.
- **Command and Control (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer)**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware to the target system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information to be used in future attacks. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the execution of code or the evolution of file structures.
- **B: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system. While it could be a step after execution, it does not directly relate to the evolution of file structures.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the execution of code or the evolution of file structures.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves hiding the malicious activity or the malicious files. The evolution of a dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions aligns well with the technique of masquerading, which is a sub-technique under Defense Evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- KONNI executed arbitrary code on the victim's machine (Execution).
- The next step was evolving its dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions (Defense Evasion, specifically T1036-Masquerading).

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: D**
