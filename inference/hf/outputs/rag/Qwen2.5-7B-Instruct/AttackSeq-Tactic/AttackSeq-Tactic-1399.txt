Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. TA413 delivered a phishing email.
2. The email led to a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' landing page.
3. The landing page was used to profile the user's system.
4. Based on the profiling, the FriarFox browser extension was delivered.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the initial access and execution techniques:
- **Initial Access**: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment, T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- **Execution**: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial access (phishing email and landing page) and the profiling of the system.

- **A: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The phishing email and landing page are part of this tactic.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or removal. While this could be a subsequent tactic, it is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment. The profiling of the system to determine the delivery of the FriarFox browser extension fits this tactic.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The phishing email and fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' landing page are part of the initial access.
2. **Profiling**: The landing page is used to profile the user's system, which is a form of discovery.
3. **Delivery of FriarFox**: Based on the profiling, the FriarFox browser extension is delivered, which is a form of execution.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial access and profiling is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
