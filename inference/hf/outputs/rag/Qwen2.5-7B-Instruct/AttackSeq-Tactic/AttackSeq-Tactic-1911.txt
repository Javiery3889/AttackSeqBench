Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
1. Spearphishing emails were used to deliver malicious VBA macros.
2. The malicious VBA macros were embedded in documents.
3. NanHaiShu established persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Execution (T1204.002-Malicious File)**: This TTP involves the execution of a malicious file, which aligns with the delivery of the malicious VBA macros.
- **Persistence (T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder)**: This TTP involves establishing persistence by modifying registry entries, which aligns with the step of establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access (T1548) involves gaining access to the target's system. While spearphishing is a form of initial access, the question specifically mentions the delivery of malicious VBA macros, which is more closely related to the Execution TTP.
- **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
  - Persistence (T1547) involves maintaining access to the target's system. The question explicitly mentions the establishment of persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry, which aligns with this TTP.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**
  - Execution (T1204) involves running malicious code. The delivery of the malicious VBA macros and their execution are described in the question, which aligns with this TTP.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (T1047) involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a critical part of an attack, it is not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the delivery of malicious VBA macros, which aligns with the Execution TTP.
- The establishment of persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry aligns with the Persistence TTP.
- The Execution TTP must occur before the Persistence TTP in the sequence of events.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. Execution (delivery of malicious VBA macros)
2. Persistence (establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry)

Therefore, the correct answer is the Execution TTP.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
