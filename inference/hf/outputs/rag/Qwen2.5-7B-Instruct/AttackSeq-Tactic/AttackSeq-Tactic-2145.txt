Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the attackers first gather system profile information from infected machines. This information is used to determine which machines will be targeted next. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers added or removed domains in the database to manage infected environments.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic: Discovery and the Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery. This indicates that the initial gathering of system profile information is part of the Discovery tactic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing and maintaining resources for an attack, which does not directly relate to the initial gathering of system information.
- **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying information about the target environment. The gathering of system profile information fits well under this tactic.
- **C: Reconnaissance** - While this tactic is also about gathering information, it is more focused on understanding the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities, which is a broader scope than just system information discovery.
- **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the means to direct the target to perform actions that support the adversary's objectives. Adding or removing domains in the database to manage infected environments is more aligned with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial gathering of system profile information (OS version, architecture, running processes) is a specific type of information gathering.
- This type of information gathering is best described by the Discovery tactic, as it involves identifying and classifying information about the target environment.
- The subsequent step of adding or removing domains in the database to manage infected environments is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
