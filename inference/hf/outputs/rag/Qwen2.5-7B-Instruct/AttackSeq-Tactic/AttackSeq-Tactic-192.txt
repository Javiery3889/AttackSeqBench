Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries gained initial access via Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling. The next step in the sequence is the use of Sliver to maintain access. We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the use of Sliver.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: Techniques include T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application and T1133-External Remote Services.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic)**: Technique T1021.004-SSH.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access within a system. It is not directly related to the initial access or maintaining access via Sliver.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves running code or commands on a system. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it is not specifically mentioned in the context of initial access or maintaining access.
- **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic is directly related to gaining entry into the target environment. The question mentions that the adversaries gained initial access via Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While Sliver is used for persistence, the question asks about the tactic that occurred before the use of Sliver.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the adversaries gained initial access via Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
- The related TTPs confirm that Initial Access is a tactic that involves gaining entry into the target environment.
- The use of Sliver for maintaining access is a persistence technique, which occurs after the initial access.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the tactic that most likely occurred before the use of Sliver to maintain access is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: C
