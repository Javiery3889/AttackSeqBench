Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. BLACKGEAR gained initial access using fake Japanese documents.
2. The next step involves connecting backdoors to C&C servers to wait for commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to gain initial access.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file to achieve a specific goal.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the campaign's backdoors connected to C&C servers to wait for commands.

- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in future attacks. While it is a crucial step, it is not directly related to the initial access or the connection to C&C servers.
- **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a network or system. It is relevant after gaining access but not before.
- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. It is not directly related to the initial access or the connection to C&C servers.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to initially gain access to a network or system. The question mentions that BLACKGEAR gained initial access using fake Japanese documents, which aligns with the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question states that BLACKGEAR gained initial access using fake Japanese documents.
2. The related TTPs mention T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which aligns with the use of fake documents.
3. The next step in the sequence is connecting backdoors to C&C servers to wait for commands.
4. The tactic that most logically precedes the connection to C&C servers is the initial access.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
