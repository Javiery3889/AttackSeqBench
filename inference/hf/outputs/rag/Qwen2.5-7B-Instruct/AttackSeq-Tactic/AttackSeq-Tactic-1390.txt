Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10:
1. Reconnaissance and propagation using tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz.
2. Conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network using Windows and open-source pentesting tools.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
- **Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**

These techniques are part of the **Discovery** tactic, which involves gathering information about the target environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial reconnaissance and propagation and before the internal reconnaissance to map the network.

- **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is more likely to occur during the initial reconnaissance phase rather than after.
- **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the network, which is more likely to occur after initial access and before conducting further reconnaissance.
- **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network, which is more likely to occur after initial access and before conducting further reconnaissance.
- **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection, which is more likely to occur throughout the entire attack lifecycle rather than specifically after initial reconnaissance and before internal reconnaissance.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Reconnaissance and Propagation**: APT10 uses tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for initial access and propagation.
2. **Persistence and Lateral Movement**: After gaining initial access, APT10 would likely establish persistence and move laterally to other systems within the network.
3. **Internal Reconnaissance**: Once persistence and lateral movement are established, APT10 would then conduct internal reconnaissance to map the network.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurs after initial reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
