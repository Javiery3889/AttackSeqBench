Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions that APT41 deployed malware like backdoors and keyloggers to execute operations in compromised systems. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT41 moved laterally to target game production environments.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Lateral Movement (T1570)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another in the network.
- **Resource Development (T1587)**: This tactic involves the development and maintenance of resources, such as tools, infrastructure, and stolen data, to support the adversary's objectives.
- **Malware (T1587.001)**: This technique involves deploying malware to compromise systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Resource Development (T1587)**: This tactic is about developing and maintaining resources, which could include the creation and deployment of malware like backdoors and keyloggers. This aligns with the question's mention of deploying malware.
- **Discovery (T1083)**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment. While it is a plausible step before lateral movement, the question specifically mentions deploying malware, which is more directly related to resource development.
- **Credential Access (T1078)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Collection (T1038)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target environment. Similar to credential access, it is a common step but not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that malware like backdoors and keyloggers were deployed. This aligns with the Resource Development tactic, which involves the development and maintenance of tools to support the adversary's objectives.
- The lateral movement to target game production environments is a subsequent step, which is consistent with the sequence of deploying malware first and then moving laterally.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Resource Development occurred before the lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
