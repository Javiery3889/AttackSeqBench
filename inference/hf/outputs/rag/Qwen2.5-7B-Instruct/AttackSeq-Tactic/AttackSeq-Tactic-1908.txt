Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access is gained through compromised retail staff passwords.
2. Malicious scripts are injected into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
3. Stolen customer data is funneled to hijacked legitimate sites for disguise.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection (Tactic):** T1185-Browser Session Hijacking
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** T1608.004-Drive-by Target
- **Impact (Tactic):** T1657-Financial Theft

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to identify which TTPs align with the sequence described in the question.

- **Initial Access (B):** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry. Compromised retail staff passwords fit this description.
- **Collection (Tactic):** T1185-Browser Session Hijacking involves intercepting data from a user's session, which aligns with the malicious scripts injecting into checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** T1608.004-Drive-by Target involves setting up a malicious website or drive-by download, which could be used to funnel stolen data to a hijacked legitimate site.
- **Impact (Tactic):** T1657-Financial Theft involves the actual theft of financial data, which is the end goal after the data is intercepted and funneled.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access (B):** Compromised retail staff passwords.
2. **Collection (Tactic):** T1185-Browser Session Hijacking (malicious scripts in checkout pages).
3. **Resource Development (Tactic):** T1608.004-Drive-by Target (hijacked legitimate sites for disguise).
4. **Impact (Tactic):** T1657-Financial Theft (stolen data).

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Initial Access (B)
- Collection (Tactic: T1185-Browser Session Hijacking)
- Resource Development (Tactic: T1608.004-Drive-by Target)
- Impact (Tactic: T1657-Financial Theft)

However, the question specifically asks for the TTP that most likely occurred when malicious scripts were injected into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data. This aligns with the Collection Tactic and the specific technique T1185-Browser Session Hijacking.

### Final Answer: C (Collection - T1185-Browser Session Hijacking)
