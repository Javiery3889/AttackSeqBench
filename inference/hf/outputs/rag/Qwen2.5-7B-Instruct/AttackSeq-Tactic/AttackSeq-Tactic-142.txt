Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where "FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor" probed files in specified directories during the Discovery phase.
   - The sequence then moves to an activity that occurs before communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS, which is part of the Command and Control activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves discovering files and directories, which aligns with the probing activity described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly follow the file and directory discovery and precede the C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that includes the C&C communication over HTTPS, which is mentioned in the question as the final step. However, the question asks for the activity that occurs **before** this.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which could logically follow the file and directory discovery and precede the C&C communication. It makes sense that after discovering files and directories, the attacker might collect data from them.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining resources for the attacker, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where file and directory discovery (T1083-File and Directory Discovery) is followed by an activity that precedes C&C communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols).
   - Collection (T1031) is a logical step that fits between the discovery of files and directories and the subsequent C&C communication. It involves gathering data, which is a natural progression after discovering files and directories.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
