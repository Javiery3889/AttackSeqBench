Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a batch file is executed to install the main payload, and then the malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about the adversary learning information about the target environment. This does not align with the sequence of gaining elevated privileges.
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**
  - Execution involves running malicious code. While this is part of the sequence, it is not the tactic that follows the installation of the main payload.
- **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
  - Resource Development is about the adversary developing tools and resources. This is not directly related to the sequence of gaining elevated privileges.
- **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
  - Privilege Escalation is the tactic that involves gaining higher-level access to the system. This aligns with the sequence where the malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing UAC.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The batch file is executed to install the main payload.
- After the payload is installed, the malware needs to gain elevated privileges.
- The technique T1548.002-Bypass User Account Control is used to achieve this.
- The tactic that involves gaining higher-level access to the system is Privilege Escalation.

### Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation
