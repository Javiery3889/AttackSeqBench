Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CostaRicto Campaign:
1. Utilized process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
2. Used a backdoor (SombRAT) to perform these actions.
3. Archived the gathered information using a custom storage file format.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - **Technique: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described:

- **A: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access is the first step in an attack where the adversary gains a foothold in the target environment. The question describes actions taken after gaining access, so this is not the correct answer.

- **B: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information from the target environment. The question describes the process of discovering processes, system information, and system time, and then archiving the information. This aligns well with the Collection tactic.

- **C: Resource Development**
  - Resource Development involves developing tools, techniques, and procedures to be used in the attack. While the custom storage file format might be considered a resource, the question focuses on the actions taken after gaining access, not the development of resources.

- **D: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying and classifying the target and its resources. The question describes the process of discovering processes, system information, and system time, which aligns with the Discovery tactic. However, the question also mentions archiving the information, which is more closely related to the Collection tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that involve discovering information and then archiving it.
- The related TTPs confirm that the Discovery tactic is relevant, but the archiving of information is a key part of the Collection process.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Collection, as it encompasses both the discovery and the archiving of information.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
