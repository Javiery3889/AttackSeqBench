### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT gained initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates for hotel guests.
   - The key aspect to focus on is the step before initial access, which involves obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location:** This technique involves the attacker matching the malware to legitimate names or locations to evade detection. However, this is more about the evasion aspect rather than the initial gathering of information.
   - **Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to deliver malware. This is related to the initial access but does not directly address the gathering of victim information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the development of resources, tools, and techniques to support the APT's operations. It does not directly address the gathering of victim information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the collection of information about the target to plan and execute an attack. The related TTPs mention techniques that involve matching legitimate names or locations, which aligns with the gathering of victim information.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to initially infiltrate a network. While it is related to the scenario, it does not specifically address the gathering of victim information.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used to direct and control an adversary's infrastructure and any lateral movements. It is not directly related to the gathering of victim information.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is **Reconnaissance**. The related TTPs mention techniques that involve matching legitimate names or locations, which is directly related to the gathering of victim information.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
