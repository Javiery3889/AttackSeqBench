Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Credential access is gained using tools like Mimikatz.
2. Lateral movement is performed by exploiting EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144).

We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred before the lateral movement.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network.
- **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)**: This technique involves exploiting a service to gain access to a remote system.
- **Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570)**: This technique involves transferring tools or payloads to a target system for further exploitation.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding detection or defending against defensive measures. It does not directly relate to the sequence of gaining access and moving laterally.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. Gaining credential access using Mimikatz is a form of initial access.
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement** - This is the tactic that occurs after gaining access and is not the initial step.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying resources and services within the network. While it can occur before lateral movement, it is not the most direct precursor to gaining access and moving laterally.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access (B)**: Gaining credential access using Mimikatz is a form of initial access, which is the first step in the sequence.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: Exploiting EternalBlue for lateral movement occurs after gaining access, but the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before this step.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:
1. Initial Access (B) - Gaining credential access.
2. Lateral Movement (C) - Exploiting EternalBlue for moving laterally.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the lateral movement is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: B
