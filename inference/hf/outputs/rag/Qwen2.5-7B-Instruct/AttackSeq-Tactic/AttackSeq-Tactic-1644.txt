Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideCopy APT group:
1. They developed resources such as phishing portals mimicking the Government of India's webmail.
2. They deployed a variety of RATs and post-infection plugins.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Resource Development, Technique: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves creating and using domains for malicious purposes, which aligns with the development of phishing portals.
- **Collection, Technique: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing web traffic to a specific site, which could be used to analyze and mimic legitimate web portals, such as the Government of India's webmail.
- **Resource Development, Technique: T1584.001-Domains**: This technique also involves creating and using domains, which again aligns with the development of phishing portals.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the development of resources and before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins.

- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. It does not directly relate to the development of phishing portals or the deployment of RATs.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves running malicious code or commands. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not specifically describe the initial steps of resource development.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this could be a goal after deploying RATs, it does not directly describe the initial steps of resource development.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a network or system. The development of phishing portals and the creation of domains are methods of gaining initial access to a system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the development of resources such as phishing portals, which is a method of gaining initial access to a system.
- The related TTPs confirm that creating and using domains (T1583.001-Domains and T1584.001-Domains) is a method of resource development.
- The deployment of RATs and post-infection plugins occurs after the initial access has been gained.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D**
