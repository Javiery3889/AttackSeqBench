Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Obfuscated loaders are used to execute the Korplug variant.
2. Data collection from the system, removable media, and network shared drives occurs.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining access to the target environment.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection**: This tactic aligns with the described data collection from the system, removable media, and network shared drives.
- **Defense Evasion**: While this tactic is relevant, it is not directly related to the data collection phase.
- **Discovery**: This tactic is more about identifying and classifying resources, which is not the primary focus of the described sequence.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic is about maintaining access, which is not the primary focus of the described sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Obfuscation and Execution**: The use of obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant is a form of **Defense Evasion**.
2. **Data Collection**: The subsequent step of collecting data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives is a clear example of the **Collection** tactic.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Defense Evasion** (to execute the loader)
- **Collection** (to gather data)

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred during Mustang Panda's campaign, based on the described sequence, is **Collection**.

### Final Answer: A: Collection
