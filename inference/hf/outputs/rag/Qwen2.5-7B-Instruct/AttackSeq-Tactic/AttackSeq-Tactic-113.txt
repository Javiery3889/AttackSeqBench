Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Charming Kitten developed phishing sites impersonating services like Google Drive and social networks.
   - This is followed by gaining initial access through spear-phishing methods.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the development of these phishing sites and before the spear-phishing.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Initial Access tactic and the T1566.002-Spearphishing Link technique.
   - This indicates that the sequence of TTPs involves the attacker first setting up the phishing sites and then using them to gain initial access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker preparing resources for an attack, which could include developing phishing sites. However, it does not directly describe the action of using these resources to gain access.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance could be part of the process, it is not directly related to the development and use of phishing sites.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves the attacker collecting data from the target. This is more relevant to what happens after initial access, not before.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the target's environment. This is more relevant to what happens after initial access, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The development of phishing sites (which is a form of resource development) is a preparatory step.
   - The use of these phishing sites to gain initial access through spear-phishing is the next step in the sequence.
   - The tactic that best fits the step between resource development and initial access is "Resource Development" because it directly describes the process of creating the phishing sites.

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
