Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Initial access via a PDF attachment.
2. Execution of scripts and batch files.
3. Registry modifications for persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique is related to persistence.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique is related to execution.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification**: This technique is also related to persistence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the initial access was via a PDF attachment. This is not directly listed in the related TTPs, but it is implied in the context of the question.
- **Execution**: The execution of scripts and batch files is directly related to the T1059.001-PowerShell technique, which falls under the Tactic of Execution.
- **Persistence**: The registry modifications for persistence are directly related to the T1112-Modify Registry technique, which falls under the Tactic of Persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with initial access via a PDF attachment, which is not explicitly listed in the related TTPs but is implied.
2. **Execution**: The execution of scripts and batch files is directly linked to the T1059.001-PowerShell technique, which is under the Tactic of Execution.
3. **Persistence**: The registry modifications for persistence are directly linked to the T1112-Modify Registry technique, which is under the Tactic of Persistence.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Execution (PowerShell)
- Persistence (Registry Modification)

### Final Answer: C: Execution and D: Persistence
