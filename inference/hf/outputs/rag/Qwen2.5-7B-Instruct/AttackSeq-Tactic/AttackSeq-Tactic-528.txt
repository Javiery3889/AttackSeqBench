Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Desert Falcons, starting with the distribution of spear phishing emails and targeted social engineering attacks.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred before they managed to control victims through Command and Control using homemade backdoors.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the tactic "Initial Access" and the technique "T1566-Phishing" and "T1566.002-Spearphishing Link."
   - These TTPs are directly related to the initial steps of the attack, which involve gaining access to the victim's system through phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic is mentioned in the question but is not the initial step. It is a later stage where the attackers maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. It is not the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access within a system. It is not the initial step but a step that might occur after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - This tactic directly corresponds to the initial steps of the attack, which include distributing spear phishing emails and conducting targeted social engineering attacks.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the initial steps of the attack, which involve distributing spear phishing emails and conducting targeted social engineering attacks.
   - The related TTPs confirm that these actions fall under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the "Initial Access" tactic occurred first, followed by the subsequent steps leading to Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
