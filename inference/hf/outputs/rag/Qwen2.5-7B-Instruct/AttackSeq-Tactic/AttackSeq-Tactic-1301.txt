Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by OceanLotus:
1. Stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines.
2. Pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks.
3. Exfiltration of data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Lateral Movement (T1550.002-Pass the Hash)**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network.
- **Defense Evasion (T1550.002-Pass the Hash)**: This technique is used to avoid detection and defend against security measures.
- **Credential Access (T1003-OS Credential Dumping)**: This technique involves stealing credentials from the operating system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While it is a common first step, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing a means of control over a compromised system. It is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. The question mentions infecting new machines and using stolen credentials, which aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection and security measures. While it is a common tactic, it is not the immediate step after infecting new machines and before exfiltrating data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves infecting new machines using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools, which aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
- After infecting new machines, the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network to gain access to more systems.
- Exfiltration of data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook would be the final step after gaining access to the necessary systems.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer: C
