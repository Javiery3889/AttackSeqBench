Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used a domain to monitor and control infected computers before exfiltrating data. The domain in question is 'update.alyac.org' resolving to a South Korean IP address.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a domain or IP address to receive data or commands.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses, which is relevant to the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to an IP address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to gain access to other systems. It does not directly involve monitoring and controlling infected computers via a domain.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the network and its resources. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly involve monitoring and controlling infected computers via a domain.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network and controlling compromised systems. The related TTPs (T1102.001 and T1071.004) directly involve using a domain and DNS to monitor and control infected computers.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the target network. While it is part of the overall attack, it does not directly involve monitoring and controlling infected computers via a domain.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the attackers used a domain to monitor and control infected computers.
- The related TTPs clearly indicate that Command and Control (T1102.001 and T1071.004) are directly involved in using a domain and DNS to achieve this.
- Lateral Movement, Discovery, and Exfiltration do not directly involve the use of a domain to monitor and control infected computers.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
