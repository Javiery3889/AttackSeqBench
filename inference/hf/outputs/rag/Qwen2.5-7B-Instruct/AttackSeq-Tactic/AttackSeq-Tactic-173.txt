Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus group initially gains access through a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application and then achieves persistence through a hidden 'autoupdater' module. We need to identify which MITRE ATT&CK tactic occurred before the persistence step.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1543.003-Windows Service**: This indicates that the attackers are using a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This indicates that the attackers are compromising the software supply chain to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Execution**: This tactic involves the execution of code or programs. While it is a step in the attack chain, it does not directly precede persistence in the given sequence.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing a means to control the compromised system. While it is important, it is not the immediate step before persistence.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attackers identifying and classifying resources on the network. This is a step that can occur after initial access but before persistence.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attackers gaining access to the target network or system. The question states that the initial access was through a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the initial access was through a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which is a form of initial access.
- After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to discover the network and resources to understand how to maintain persistence.
- The persistence step involves using a hidden 'autoupdater' module, which is a technique under the Persistence tactic.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first gain initial access, then discover the network, and finally achieve persistence.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
