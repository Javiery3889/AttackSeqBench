Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information. The next step is to enable HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding. This indicates that the malware is preparing to communicate with its command and control (C2) server in a way that is both encrypted and obfuscated.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the methods used by an adversary to maintain access to and control over a victim's system.
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding (Technique):** This technique involves the use of standard encoding schemes to obfuscate data.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic involves techniques used by an adversary to avoid detection or analysis.
- **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File (Technique):** This technique involves the use of encryption and encoding to protect data.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (Technique):** This technique involves the process of removing obfuscation or encoding from data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic is not directly related to the described actions of enabling HTTPS communication with encryption and encoding.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is not directly related to the described actions.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution** - This tactic involves the running of code or scripts, which is not directly related to the described actions.
- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic is directly related to the described actions, as it involves maintaining access and control over a victim's system, which includes enabling secure and obfuscated communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already gathered system information, which is part of the initial reconnaissance phase.
- The next step is to enable secure and obfuscated communication, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding is a form of encryption and encoding, which is covered by the T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File technique.
- The T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique is also relevant, as the C2 server would need to decode the information received.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
