Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Initial access is gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable.
2. TDrop2 malware uses process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the use of process hollowing (T1055.012) by TDrop2 malware.

- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. While it is a necessary step, it does not directly precede the use of process hollowing.
- **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary avoiding or bypassing security mechanisms. Process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion, but it is not the tactic that occurs before it.
- **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. Reconnaissance is a common step before executing malware and using techniques like process hollowing.
- **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the resources needed for the attack. While it is important, it does not directly precede the use of process hollowing.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable is a form of exploitation, which is part of the Execution tactic.
- The use of process hollowing to inject malicious code is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic.
- Reconnaissance is a logical step that would occur before gaining initial access and using process hollowing.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that Reconnaissance (C) occurred before the use of process hollowing (T1055.012) by TDrop2 malware.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
