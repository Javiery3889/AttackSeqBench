Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has:
1. Maintained persistence through the creation of a link in the Startup folder.
2. Created additional files in the `%AppData%` directory.
3. Facilitated communication with dynamic DNS-associated domains like `dtl.dnsd.me:63`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic**: Persistence
- **Technique**: T1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. The actions described (creating a link in the Startup folder and additional files in `%AppData%`) are consistent with persistence techniques.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to control the compromised system. Facilitating communication with a dynamic DNS domain (`dtl.dnsd.me:63`) is a common method for Command and Control (C2) communication.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target system. The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker avoiding detection or analysis. While this could be part of the overall attack, the specific actions described are more directly related to persistence and C2.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The actions of creating a link in the Startup folder and additional files in `%AppData%` are persistence techniques.
2. **Command and Control**: Facilitating communication with a dynamic DNS domain (`dtl.dnsd.me:63`) is a Command and Control activity.
3. **Exfiltration and Defense Evasion**: These tactics are not directly mentioned in the question.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Persistence** to maintain access.
- **Command and Control** to facilitate communication with the C2 server.

However, the question asks for the most likely tactic that facilitated the communication with the C2 server. Based on the related TTPs and the specific actions described, the most relevant tactic is Command and Control.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
