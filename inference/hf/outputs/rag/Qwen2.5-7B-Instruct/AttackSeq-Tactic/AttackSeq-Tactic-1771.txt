Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and execute reconnaissance of the card processing service. This implies that the sequence of events should be:
1. An action that precedes the use of captured credentials.
2. The use of captured credentials to connect to the network.
3. The execution of reconnaissance on the card processing service.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Credential Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials, which aligns with the use of captured credentials.
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the network, which could be a precursor to using captured credentials.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic)**: This tactic involves moving within the network, which is not directly related to the use of captured credentials.
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic)**: This tactic involves gathering information, which is the final step in the sequence.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (T1078-Valid Accounts)**: This TTP involves gaining access to the network using valid accounts, which could be a precursor to using captured credentials.
- **Credential Access (T1056.003-Web Portal Capture)**: This TTP involves capturing credentials, which is the step that follows gaining access.
- **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials)**: This TTP involves using credentials to gather information, which is the final step in the sequence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers need to gain access to the network. This is the first step in the sequence.
2. **Credential Access**: Once access is gained, the attackers capture credentials. This is the second step.
3. **Reconnaissance**: Using the captured credentials, the attackers then perform reconnaissance on the card processing service. This is the final step.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the use of captured credentials is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
