Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of activities where IRIDIUM conducted preparation activities to boost destructive and intelligence-gathering capacity and then sought to identify specific types of organizations as potential targets. This indicates a strategic and targeted approach to reconnaissance and target selection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves developing and using email accounts, which can be part of resource development but also fits into reconnaissance.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the location of systems, which is a form of discovery.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which aligns with the preparation activities to boost destructive and intelligence-gathering capacity. It also fits with the need to identify specific organizations as potential targets.
- **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target network, which typically comes after reconnaissance and target identification.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the target's network and systems, which is a step that follows reconnaissance and initial access.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the target, which is a step that typically comes after discovery and data collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Preparation Activities**: These activities are likely part of the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker gathers information and prepares for the attack.
2. **Target Identification**: The attacker seeks to identify specific organizations as potential targets, which is a form of reconnaissance.
3. **Gathering Credentials and Email Accounts**: These activities are also part of reconnaissance to gather more information about the target environment.
4. **System Location Discovery**: This is a form of discovery, which comes after reconnaissance and initial access.

Given the sequence of activities described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is reconnaissance, followed by target identification and system location discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
