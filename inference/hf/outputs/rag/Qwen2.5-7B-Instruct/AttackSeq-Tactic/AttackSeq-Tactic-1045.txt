Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the ProjectM actors delivered payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the delivery of payloads.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system.
- **Technique T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a website or other online resource to deliver malware to visitors.
- **Technique T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves sending a malicious link via email to trick the recipient into clicking and executing the payload.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. It is a logical step before delivering payloads via spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.
- **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary causing harm or achieving their objective. This would typically occur after the payload has been delivered and executed.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing the resources needed for the attack, such as tools and infrastructure. While this is important, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to payload delivery.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary avoiding detection by security measures. This would be a step that occurs during or after the attack, not before payload delivery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This is the most logical step before delivering payloads. The attackers would need to gather information about their target to craft effective spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks.
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This is a broader category that includes techniques like T1189-Drive-by Compromise and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link, which are specific methods used to gain access to the target's system.
- **Techniques T1189-Drive-by Compromise and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: These techniques are specific methods used to deliver the payload, but they occur after the reconnaissance phase.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurs before the delivery of payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer: A
