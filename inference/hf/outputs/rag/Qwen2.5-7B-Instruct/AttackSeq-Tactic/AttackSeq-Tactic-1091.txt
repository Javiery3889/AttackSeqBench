Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Iron group:
1. Gained access through deploying a previously unknown backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
2. Protected their installer sample with VMProtect.
3. Compressed the installer using UPX.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
- **Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing**: This technique involves packing software to make it harder to analyze.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial access but before the protection and compression of the installer.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target network or system. The question already states that the Iron group gained access, so this is not the next step.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the running of code on the target system. The protection and compression of the installer would be part of the execution phase, but the question asks for what happened after gaining access but before these actions.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. The question does not mention any data exfiltration, so this is not the correct answer.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or data. The question does not mention any further credential access after the initial access, so this is not the correct answer.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Iron group gained access through deploying a backdoor.
- The next step would be to use the backdoor to execute the installer.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for protecting and packing the installer, which aligns with the actions described in the question.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining access but before protecting and compressing the installer is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: B
