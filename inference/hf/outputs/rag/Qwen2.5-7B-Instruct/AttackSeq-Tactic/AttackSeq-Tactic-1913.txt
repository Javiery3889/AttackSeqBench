### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of techniques used by NanHaiShu to hinder detection of a decoy XLS and JScript file. Specifically, it mentions base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs include:
     - **Defense Evasion** T1027.013: Encrypted/Encoded File
     - **Defense Evasion** T1027.010: Command Obfuscation
     - **Defense Evasion** T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The techniques mentioned in the question (base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation) align closely with the related TTPs, which are all under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - Base64 encoding is a form of encoding that can be categorized under T1027.013 (Encrypted/Encoded File).
   - Layered URL string obfuscation can be seen as a form of command obfuscation, which aligns with T1027.010 (Command Obfuscation).
   - Both of these techniques are aimed at evading detection and analysis, which is the primary goal of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the techniques described in the question are directly related to the **Defense Evasion** tactic, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the initial use of these techniques would still be under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
