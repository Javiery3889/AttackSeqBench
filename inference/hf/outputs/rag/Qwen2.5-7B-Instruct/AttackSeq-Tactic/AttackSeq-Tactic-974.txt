Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by CosmicDuke:
1. CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
2. After collecting the information, CosmicDuke enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
3. CosmicDuke exfiltrates data via FTP and WebDav servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the exfiltration process:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.
- **Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol)**: This technique involves using non-C2 channels for data exfiltration, such as HTTP GET requests and FTP.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to a target system for the purpose of executing commands.
  - The question mentions enabling communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, which aligns with the use of a C2 channel.
  - The related TTPs mention "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel," which supports this choice.

- **B: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access systems that are not immediately connected to the initial point of compromise.
  - The question does not mention moving to other systems, so this does not align with the described sequence.

- **C: Execution**
  - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system.
  - While the question mentions collecting information, the focus is on exfiltration, not execution of additional malicious code.

- **D: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system.
  - The question describes the collection phase but does not focus on the exfiltration process.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the collection of information and the subsequent exfiltration of that data.
- The related TTPs mention exfiltration over C2 channels and unencrypted non-C2 protocols.
- The most relevant tactic for enabling communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltrating data via FTP and WebDav servers is Command and Control (C2).

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
