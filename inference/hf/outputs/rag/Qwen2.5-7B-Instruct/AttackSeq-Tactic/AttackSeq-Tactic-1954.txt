Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the OceanLotus backdoor evaded defenses using robust string encoding and custom encryption to communicate with its command and control server. This indicates that the backdoor is using sophisticated methods to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic is relevant as it covers the methods used to evade detection.
  - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding to reveal the true nature of the data.
  - **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves using encryption or encoding to hide the content of files.
  - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or use.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the OceanLotus backdoor evaded defenses using robust string encoding and custom encryption.

- **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the backdoor communicating with its command and control server. While this is a critical part of the attack, it is not directly related to the evasion techniques mentioned.
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources used in the attack. It is not directly related to the evasion techniques mentioned.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker discovering information about the target environment. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the evasion techniques mentioned.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the attacker executing the payload or malicious code. This is a critical part of the attack, but it is not directly related to the evasion techniques mentioned.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes evasion techniques (string encoding and custom encryption) that are part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
- The next logical step after evading defenses would be to establish a means of communication with the command and control server, which is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. **Defense Evasion** (using robust string encoding and custom encryption)
2. **Command and Control** (establishing communication with the C2 server)

Therefore, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
