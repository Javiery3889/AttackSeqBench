Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with gaining initial access through phishing emails and creating backdoors. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement and compromised the Enterprise Admin account.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target network.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker moving from the initial foothold to other parts of the network.
- **Execution (Tactic):** This tactic involves the attacker executing code or commands on the target system.
- **Domain Accounts (Technique):** This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access.
- **Internal Spearphishing (Technique):** This technique involves using spearphishing to gain initial access.
- **Valid Accounts (Technique):** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already mentioned in the question.
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This is the step that follows initial access and is mentioned in the question.
- **Execution (Tactic):** This is a step that can occur after gaining access but is not directly related to the sequence of moving to the Enterprise Admin account.
- **Domain Accounts (Technique):** This technique is related to gaining access but is not a tactic.
- **Internal Spearphishing (Technique):** This technique is related to gaining initial access but is not a tactic.
- **Valid Accounts (Technique):** This technique is related to gaining access but is not a tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement and compromised the Enterprise Admin account.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is: Initial Access -> Lateral Movement -> Compromise of Enterprise Admin account.
- The tactic that directly precedes Lateral Movement in this sequence is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
