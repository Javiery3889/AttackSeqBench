Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Adversaries conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems.
2. This was followed by the use of malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.003-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using spearphishing links, which is also a form of reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the reconnaissance and before the use of malicious updates to sever connections.

- **A: Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of an attack, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or denial of service. It does not fit the sequence as it comes after the malicious updates.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing, maintaining, and using channels for the adversary to direct the compromised system. While it is a critical step, it is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. It is closely related to reconnaissance but does not fit the sequence as it is not the step after reconnaissance and before malicious updates.
- **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. It is a step that can occur after reconnaissance but before using malicious updates to sever connections, as it involves moving to critical systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves reconnaissance followed by a malicious action to sever connections.
- Lateral movement (D) is a logical step between reconnaissance and the use of malicious updates to sever connections, as it involves moving to critical systems.
- The other options do not fit the sequence as well as lateral movement does.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
