Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs that occur after the decryption and execution of a payload in memory but before persistence is established. The key points are:
- The payload is decrypted and executed in memory.
- Persistence is not yet established (via service creation or registry Run key).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Persistence**: This tactic is mentioned, but the question specifies that persistence has not yet been established.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic includes techniques like T1027.009-Embedded Payloads, which aligns with the question's mention of embedded payloads.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which typically happens after persistence.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is a preliminary step and not directly related to the sequence described.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Command and Control**: This typically occurs after persistence is established, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
- **B: Discovery**: This is a preliminary step and not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: Persistence**: This is the tactic that involves establishing a long-term presence on the system, but the question specifies that persistence has not yet been established.
- **D: Execution**: This involves running the payload, which aligns with the question's description of the payload being decrypted and executed in memory.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs that occur after the payload is decrypted and executed in memory but before persistence is established.
- The related TTPs, particularly T1027.009-Embedded Payloads, indicate that the payload is being executed.
- The next logical step in the attack sequence, after the payload is executed, would be to establish a foothold or further actions that do not yet involve persistence.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
