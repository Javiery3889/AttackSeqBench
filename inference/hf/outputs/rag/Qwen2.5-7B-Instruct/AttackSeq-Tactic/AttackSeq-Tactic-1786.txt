Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Elise malware moved its payload to a specific directory.
2. The malware executed the payload by injecting a DLL into Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe).

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic is not directly related to the execution of the DLL.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic is related to the technique of Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001).

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the described actions.

- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources and information. It does not fit the context of executing a payload.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the means to direct the target's resources. While it is a common post-exploitation tactic, it is not directly related to the execution of the DLL.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While it is a common post-exploitation tactic, it is not directly related to the execution of the DLL.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. The technique of Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001) is explicitly mentioned in the related TTPs, which is a method to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already moved its payload and executed it by injecting a DLL into Internet Explorer.
2. The next logical step would be to ensure that this action is not detected by defensive measures.
3. The related TTPs mention Defense Evasion, specifically the technique of Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055.001).

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer: D
