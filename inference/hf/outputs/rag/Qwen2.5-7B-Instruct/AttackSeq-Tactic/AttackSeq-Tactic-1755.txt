Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. EVILNUM ensures persistence by adding a registry key tailored to evade detection based on the antivirus on the system.
2. Before communicating with the C2 server by sending a GET request to check.php for one-way communications.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1112-Modify Registry**
  - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
  - This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel to the C2 server.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic is about gathering information from the target system. The actions described in the question do not align with the goal of collecting information.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources and information. The actions described do not align with the goal of discovering information.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target system. The final action described (sending a GET request to check.php for one-way communication) aligns with this tactic.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target system. The actions described do not align with the goal of initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes persistence and communication with the C2 server, which are actions that fall under the Command and Control tactic.
- The related TTPs specifically mention techniques for modifying the registry to evade detection (Defense Evasion) and establishing one-way communication with the C2 server (Command and Control).

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
