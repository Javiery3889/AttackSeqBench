Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by IndigoZebra:
1. They used a dropper executable.
2. The dropper opened a document to reduce suspicion.
3. The dropper then dropped and executed the backdoor 'C:\users\public\spools.exe'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the described sequence of actions.

- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. It doesn't directly relate to the initial actions described.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The use of a dropper and opening a document to reduce suspicion suggests that this is likely the initial step in the attack.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The dropper opening a document and then dropping and executing the backdoor 'C:\users\public\spools.exe' is a form of execution.
- **Privilege Escalation (D)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not directly related to the initial actions described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The dropper executable and the document opening are actions that would typically occur during the initial access phase of an attack.
2. The execution of the backdoor 'C:\users\public\spools.exe' is a form of execution.
3. The initial access tactic (B) is the most logical step that would precede the execution of the backdoor.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
