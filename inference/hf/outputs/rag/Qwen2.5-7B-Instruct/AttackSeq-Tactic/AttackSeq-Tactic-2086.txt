Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Malware downloads 'upnphost.exe' to '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp'.
2. Before gathering operating system information to send to '45.124.132.127'.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files to avoid detection.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering information from the local system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the malware downloaded the file and before it gathered operating system information.

- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the creation and running of code. While the malware downloading the file 'upnphost.exe' is an execution step, it is not the most likely tactic to occur before the download.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to an external location. It is not the most likely tactic to occur before the download and before gathering operating system information.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary's first step to establish a foothold on the target system. The malware downloading 'upnphost.exe' to '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp' is a clear indication of initial access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware downloading 'upnphost.exe' to '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp' is a clear indication of initial access, as it is the first step in establishing a foothold on the target system.
- The action of gathering operating system information to send to '45.124.132.127' is a subsequent step, likely following the initial access.
- The related TTPs do not directly influence the choice between the tactics, but they provide context that the malware is likely evading detection and collecting data.

### Final Answer: D
