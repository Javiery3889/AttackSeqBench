Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before UNC2452 used a supply chain compromise through a compromised software update for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. It is a common step before any attack, including supply chain attacks, to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the means to direct an attack. It typically occurs after initial access and is used to control the compromised system.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and services on the network. It usually follows initial access to understand the environment better.
- **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves developing and preparing resources for an attack. It can include developing malware or other tools, but it is not typically the first step in an attack sequence.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The attack sequence starts with Initial Access, which is the entry point into the target network.
2. **Supply Chain Compromise**: The specific method used for Initial Access is a supply chain compromise, which involves compromising a software update to gain access.
3. **Reconnaissance**: Before using a supply chain attack, the attackers would likely gather information about the target, including the SolarWinds Orion platform, to understand how to compromise it effectively.

### Final Answer: 
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is that Reconnaissance occurred before the supply chain compromise for Initial Access.

Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
