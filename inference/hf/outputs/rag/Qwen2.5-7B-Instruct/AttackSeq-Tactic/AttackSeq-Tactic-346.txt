Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Connecting to a C2 server to download and execute the payload.
2. Deleting files with specific extensions on removable and network drives.
3. Replacing the deleted files with a copy of the malware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files, which aligns with the action described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to a system, which is the first step in the attack sequence. The question describes actions that occur after initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This tactic is about causing harm or disruption, which could be a result of the actions described but is not the immediate action.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system, which is also not the immediate action described.
- **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or countermeasures, and T1070.004-File Deletion is a specific technique under this tactic. The action of deleting files to replace them with malware is a form of defense evasion.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions that occur after initial access, such as connecting to a C2 server and executing a payload.
- The next action is deleting files, which is a form of defense evasion to avoid detection.
- Replacing the deleted files with a copy of the malware is also a form of defense evasion to ensure persistence and avoid detection.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: D**
