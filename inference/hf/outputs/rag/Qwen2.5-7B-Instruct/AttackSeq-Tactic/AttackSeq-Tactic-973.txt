Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This indicates that the actor has already gained some level of access and is searching for specific files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the tactic "Discovery" and the technique "T1083-File and Directory Discovery." This suggests that the actor is in the process of identifying and understanding the environment, which aligns with the described activity of searching for specific files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. The question does not indicate that the actor has moved to other systems but rather is searching for specific files.
- **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the actor identifying and understanding the environment. The described activity of searching for specific files fits well with the "Discovery" tactic.
- **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing channels for the actor to communicate with the compromised system. The question does not indicate any communication or command and control activities.
- **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target environment. While the actor is searching for specific files, the question does not explicitly state that the actor is collecting data for exfiltration or further use.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actor is searching for specific files, which is a form of "Discovery" as they are identifying and understanding the environment.
- The related TTPs specifically mention "Discovery" and "File and Directory Discovery," which align with the described activity.
- The other options do not fit the described activity as well as "Discovery."

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
