Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already collected sensitive data from the victims' mobile devices. The next step in the sequence is to transmit this stolen information back to a specific domain.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the initial collection of sensitive data from the mobile devices.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Persistence**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining access to the target system over an extended period. While persistence could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the transmission of data.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining channels for control and communication with the compromised system. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the transmission of data.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources and information within the target environment. This is more about the initial reconnaissance and does not directly address the transmission of data.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information from the target environment. While this aligns with the initial collection of data, it does not address the transmission of that data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial step of collecting data (Answer Choice D: Collection) is already described in the question.
- The next step is to transmit this data back to the attacker-controlled domain (firmwaresystemupdate[.]com). This transmission is best described by the **Exfiltration** tactic, specifically the **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** technique.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control

While the question does not explicitly mention Command and Control, it is the most logical choice for the next step in the sequence after data collection. Command and Control is often used to manage the data exfiltration process, ensuring that the data is transmitted securely and efficiently to the attacker's domain.
