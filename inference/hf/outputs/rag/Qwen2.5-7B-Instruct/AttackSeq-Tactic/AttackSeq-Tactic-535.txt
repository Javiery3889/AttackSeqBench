Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
- Defense evasion techniques are used (e.g., verifying Google reachability and implementing a modular design).
- The tool 'bird.exe' is used to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1217-Browser Information Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is not directly related to gathering information about the victim's system. It is more about developing and maintaining resources, which does not fit the context of the question.

- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
  - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining channels for the adversary to direct the compromised system. While it is a critical part of an attack, the question specifically mentions gathering detailed information about the victim's system, which is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.

- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent activities. The related TTPs mention techniques for discovering browser information and system information, which aligns well with the use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

- **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. While the question mentions defense evasion techniques, the core activity described (gathering detailed information about the victim's system) is more closely aligned with the Discovery tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.
- The related TTPs specifically mention techniques for discovering browser information and system information, which are part of the Discovery tactic.
- The defense evasion techniques mentioned in the question are preparatory steps and do not directly describe the core activity of gathering information.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
