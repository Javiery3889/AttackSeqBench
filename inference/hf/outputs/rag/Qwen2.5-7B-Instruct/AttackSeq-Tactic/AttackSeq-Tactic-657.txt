Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages and then exploits vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into the victim networks. We need to identify the tactic that occurs after the credential harvesting and before the exploitation of vulnerabilities.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step where the adversary gains a foothold in the network.
- **Spearphishing Link (T1598.003):** This is a specific technique under Initial Access.
- **Credentials (T1589.001):** This is a specific technique under Reconnaissance, which is a tactic that precedes the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** This is a specific technique under Initial Access, which is the tactic that follows the credential harvesting.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to user credentials, which aligns with the credential harvesting via fake login pages.
- **Privilege Escalation (A):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access within the network, which typically occurs after initial access and credential harvesting.
- **Resource Development (C):** This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining access to the network, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another, which typically occurs after gaining initial access and credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access (Tactic):** APT28 uses spear-phishing (T1598.003) to gain initial access.
2. **Credential Access (B):** After gaining initial access, APT28 harvests credentials via fake login pages (T1589.001).
3. **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190):** This is the next step where APT28 exploits vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain deeper access.

The tactic that occurs after credential harvesting and before the exploitation of vulnerabilities is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: B
