Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Configuration files are decoded to issue new instructions.
2. These instructions are for targeted DDoS attacks.
3. KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**: This technique is directly related to the DDoS attacks mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is related to decoding configuration files to issue new instructions.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources. It does not directly relate to the decoding or receiving of instructions for DDoS attacks.
- **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While it can be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the decoding or receiving of instructions.
- **C: Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as the DDoS attacks mentioned. It occurs after the instructions are received and executed.
- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker controlling the compromised systems. It is more about the communication channel rather than the initial steps of receiving instructions.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be:
1. **Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140)**: This is the process of decoding the configuration files to issue new instructions.
2. **KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions**: After decoding, the implants receive the instructions.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The decoding of configuration files (T1140) is a crucial step before the implants receive targeting instructions.
- The tactic that best fits before the decoding and receiving of instructions is **Reconnaissance** (B), as it involves gathering the necessary information to decode and execute the instructions.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
