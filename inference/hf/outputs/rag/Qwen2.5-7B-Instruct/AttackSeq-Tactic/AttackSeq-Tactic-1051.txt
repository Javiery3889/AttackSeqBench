Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Taidoor malware is delivered via a spear-phishing email attachment that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158). We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this delivery.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This TTP directly relates to the delivery method (spear-phishing email attachment) used to deliver the malware.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP is related to the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to execute the malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their vulnerabilities. While it is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it does not directly precede the delivery of malware via a spear-phishing email.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's network or system. The spear-phishing email attachment is a method of initial access, but the question asks for what occurred before the delivery of the malware.
- **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. This is a logical step that would precede the initial access via spear-phishing.
- **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not necessarily the first step in the scenario described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario involves a spear-phishing email attachment, which is a method of initial access.
- The question asks for what occurred before the delivery of the malware.
- Reconnaissance (Choice C) is a logical step that would precede the initial access via spear-phishing. The attacker would need to gather information about the target to craft a convincing spear-phishing email.
- Discovery (Choice A) and Initial Access (Choice B) are not the first steps in this scenario, as they are more about the method of delivery rather than the preparatory steps.
- Credential Access (Choice D) is not necessarily the first step in this scenario, as the spear-phishing email is used to deliver the malware directly.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
