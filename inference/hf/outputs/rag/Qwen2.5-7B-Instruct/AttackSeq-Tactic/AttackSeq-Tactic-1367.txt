Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell**: This indicates that web shells are used for persistence.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This suggests that external remote services are used to gain initial access to the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Reconnaissance**: While reconnaissance is a common first step in many cyber attacks, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned (web shells and external remote services).
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about avoiding detection, which is not the primary focus of the question.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one part of a network to another, which would occur after initial access and persistence have been established.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target network, which aligns with the use of external remote services (T1133-External Remote Services).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access (D)**: This is the first step in the attack sequence, where FIN13 uses external remote services to gain entry into the victim network.
- **Persistence (Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1505.003-Web Shell)**: After gaining initial access, FIN13 deploys web shells to maintain a persistent presence in the network.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Initial Access (D) occurred first, followed by Persistence.

### Final Answer: D
