Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. A malicious PowerShell-based downloader script is used as an initial foothold.
2. The group then implements a malicious Registry Run key and a VB script using LoLBins for execution during reboot or re-login.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell
- Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.005-Visual Basic

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial foothold (PowerShell-based downloader script) but before the persistence mechanisms (Registry Run key and VB script).

- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system, typically after initial access. It is not the immediate next step after initial foothold.
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system. While it is a critical step, it is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defenders. It is not the immediate next step after initial access.
- **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time, which aligns with the next steps described in the question (Registry Run key and VB script).

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial foothold is established using a malicious PowerShell-based downloader script.
2. The next step is to ensure the system remains compromised even after the user logs out or the system reboots. This is best described by the Persistence tactic.
3. The techniques mentioned (Registry Run key and VB script using LoLBins) are specific methods of achieving persistence.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Persistence.

### Final Answer: D
