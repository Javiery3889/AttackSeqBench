Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance.
   - The next step is to establish communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention the Command and Control (C2) tactic and the technique T1071.001-Web Protocols, which involves using web protocols for C2.
   - Another related tactic is Exfiltration, but it is not directly relevant to the establishment of communication with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This aligns with the tactic of establishing communication with control servers, which is a core function of Command and Control.
     - The technique T1071.001-Web Protocols supports this, as it involves using web protocols (like HTTP POST) for C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic is not directly related to establishing communication with control servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment, which has already been done according to the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic is about gaining higher levels of access or permissions, which is not directly related to establishing communication with control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to establish communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.

Final Answer: A
