Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in an attack scenario:
1. Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute a malicious payload.
2. Evasion of detection by masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This TTP aligns with the exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute a payload.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This TTP aligns with the evasion of detection by masquerading connections.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**: This TTP is about the process of transferring data from the target to the attacker. It does not directly follow the execution of a payload or the evasion of detection.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This TTP is about the attacker identifying and gathering information about the target environment. It does not follow the execution of a payload or the evasion of detection.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This TTP is about the attacker gaining access to the target environment. It does not follow the execution of a payload or the evasion of detection.
- **Answer Choice D: Execution**: This TTP is about the attacker running code or scripts on the target system. It directly follows the exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute a payload.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute a payload, which aligns with the **Execution** TTP.
- After the payload is executed, the attackers then evade detection by masquerading their backdoor connections as SSL connections, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** TTP.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. **Execution** (exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute a payload)
2. **Defense Evasion** (masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections)

Therefore, the most plausible answer choice is the one that directly follows the execution of the payload.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
