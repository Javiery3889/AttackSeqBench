Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
1. Conducted internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
2. Leveraged shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This suggests that the attackers are moving between systems using tools or infrastructure.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This indicates that the attackers are discovering network services, which aligns with the internal reconnaissance described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly mentioned in the question. While it could be a step in the process, it is not the most immediate step after reconnaissance.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems, which aligns with the internal reconnaissance described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: Impact**: This tactic involves causing harm or damage, which is not mentioned in the question.
- **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes APT10 conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network. This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the **T1046-Network Service Discovery** technique.
- After the reconnaissance, the attackers are leveraging shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally. This suggests that the next step would be to use the information gathered during the reconnaissance to move between systems, which is a form of **Lateral Movement**.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. **Discovery** (to gather information about the network)
2. **Lateral Movement** (to move between systems using the gathered information)

Therefore, the most immediate step after the reconnaissance would be **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: B
