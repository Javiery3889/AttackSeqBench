Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - PROMETHIUM's malware compresses Microsoft Office files into an archive.
   - The next step is sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Collection" as a tactic and "Archive Collected Data" and "Archive via Custom Method" as techniques.
   - This indicates that the malware is collecting data (in this case, compressed Office files) and then archiving it using a custom method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic is about running malicious code or scripts. While the malware is executing code to compress and archive files, this is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to a target system. Sending the archive to a C2 server is a step in establishing and maintaining control, but it is not the immediate next step after archiving.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target environment. This is not relevant to the next step after archiving.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves transferring data from the target to an external location. Sending the archive to a C2 server is the act of transferring the data, which aligns with the exfiltration tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after archiving the data, the next step is to exfiltrate it to a C2 server.
   - Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
