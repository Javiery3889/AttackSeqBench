### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an APT group using a malicious DLL payload to establish a remote connection back to a server with the IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999.
   - This indicates that the group has established a form of communication with a remote server, which is a characteristic of Command and Control (C2) activities.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
     - **Technique: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels for communication, which aligns with the scenario of establishing a remote connection.
   - **Tactic: Persistence**
     - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to maintain persistence. While this is a relevant technique, it is more about maintaining a foothold rather than establishing a remote connection.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
     - **Technique: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is the same as in Persistence, and it is about evading detection by using legitimate processes to load malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it can be a part of an attack, it does not directly relate to establishing a remote connection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. Again, while it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to establishing a remote connection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic directly involves establishing a remote connection to a server, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from a system. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to establishing a remote connection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
