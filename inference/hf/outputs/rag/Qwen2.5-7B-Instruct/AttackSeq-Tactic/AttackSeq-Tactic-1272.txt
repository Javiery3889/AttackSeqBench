Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the use of these tools for reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and systems, which aligns with the scanning and mapping activities mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique involves blocking indicators to avoid detection, which is relevant to the part of the question about not leaving binary traces on disk.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it is a critical step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the scanning and mapping activities described.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems, which aligns with the scanning and mapping activities mentioned. It is a logical precursor to using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code or scripts. While it is a critical step, it typically follows the reconnaissance phase.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While it is important, it is also a step that typically follows the reconnaissance phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the tactic should occur before the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets.
- The related TTPs mention "Discovery" as a tactic that involves gathering information about the network and systems, which is directly related to the scanning and mapping activities.
- The other options (Privilege Escalation, Execution, and Credential Access) are more likely to occur after the initial reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
