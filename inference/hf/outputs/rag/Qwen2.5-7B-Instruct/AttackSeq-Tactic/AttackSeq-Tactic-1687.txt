Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary has already used discovery tactics, such as using PsLogList to export Security Event logs. The next step in the sequence is the collection of data from various sources like SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves enumerating logs, which aligns with the use of PsLogList to export Security Event logs.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.008-Clear Mailbox Data**: This technique involves clearing mailbox data, which is related to the collection of data from email mailboxes.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves discovering accounts, which is a form of discovery but not directly related to the collection of data from various sources.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to a network or system, which typically precedes the discovery and data collection phases.
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a network or system, which typically follows the initial access and discovery phases.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic is about identifying the network and systems, which is already described in the question.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic is about moving from one system to another within the network, which typically follows the discovery phase and precedes the data collection phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the adversary has already used discovery tactics, such as using PsLogList to export Security Event logs.
- The next step in the sequence is the collection of data from various sources like SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares.
- Lateral Movement (D) is the most plausible tactic that follows the discovery phase and precedes the data collection phase. It involves moving from one system to another, which is necessary to access different sources of data.

### Final Answer: D
