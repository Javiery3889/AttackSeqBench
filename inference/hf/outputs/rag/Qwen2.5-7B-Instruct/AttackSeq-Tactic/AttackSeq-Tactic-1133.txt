Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control communications with compromised systems. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred based on this information.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide the following information:
- **Tactic: Command and Control**
  - **Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Technique: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Technique: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question does not mention any initial access or how the adversary initially gained access, so this is unlikely.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target network. The question does not mention any data being stolen, so this is unlikely.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target network. The question explicitly mentions command and control communications, which aligns with this tactic.
- **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary causing harm or damage to the target network. The question does not mention any harm or damage, so this is unlikely.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control communications.
- The related TTPs confirm that the Command and Control tactic is relevant and includes techniques for using application layer protocols (T1071) and encrypted channels (T1573).
- None of the other tactics (Initial Access, Exfiltration, or Impact) are mentioned or implied in the question.

### Final Answer: C
