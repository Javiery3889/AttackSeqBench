Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers:
1. Opened spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links.
2. Utilized an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using links in spear phishing emails.
- **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using attachments in spear phishing emails.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about the initial entry into a network. The question describes the initial step of opening spear phishing emails, which is a form of initial access.
- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the steps taken to run malicious code or scripts. While the use of an undocumented Word feature could be considered execution, the question does not explicitly mention running code or scripts.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection aligns well with this tactic.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. The question does not mention any reconnaissance activities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial step of opening spear phishing emails, which is a form of initial access.
- The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection is a defense evasion technique.
- The question does not mention any reconnaissance or execution steps beyond the initial access.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Initial Access** (B) to gain entry.
- **Defense Evasion** (C) to avoid detection.

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access, which is the use of the undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: C**
