### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT37 has already achieved defense evasion using compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service providers.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic APT37 followed to communicate with and control compromised systems.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the initial step.
   - **Credential Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the communication and control of compromised systems.
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves establishing, operating, and maintaining the means by which threat actors control and direct compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to other systems. While it is a critical step in an attack, it does not directly address the communication and control of compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is already mentioned in the question and does not follow the initial steps described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It does not fit the sequence as it precedes the steps described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control** - This tactic directly addresses the communication and control of compromised systems, which aligns with the next step in the sequence after defense evasion.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
