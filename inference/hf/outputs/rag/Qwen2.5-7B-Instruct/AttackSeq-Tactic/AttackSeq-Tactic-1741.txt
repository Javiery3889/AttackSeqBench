Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Turla used LightNeuron to discover system network configurations.
2. An unknown TTP occurred after this.
3. Turla then used emails to conduct C&C communication with encrypted data hidden in PDF or JPG files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Command and Control (C&C)**: This tactic is mentioned, which aligns with the final step of using emails for C&C communication.
- **Steganography**: This technique is mentioned, which aligns with hiding encrypted data in PDF or JPG files.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the discovery of system network configurations and before the C&C communication.

- **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. It doesn't directly align with the sequence described.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to the target system. It also doesn't fit the sequence described.
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it could be part of the process, it doesn't directly align with the sequence described.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. It aligns well with the final step of using emails for C&C communication.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery of System Network Configurations**: This is a preparatory step.
2. **Collection**: This could be the next step where Turla gathers information.
3. **Command and Control**: This is the final step where Turla uses emails for C&C communication with encrypted data hidden in PDF or JPG files.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Discovery of system network configurations (not explicitly listed but implied)
- Collection (gathering information)
- Command and Control (using emails for C&C communication)

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
