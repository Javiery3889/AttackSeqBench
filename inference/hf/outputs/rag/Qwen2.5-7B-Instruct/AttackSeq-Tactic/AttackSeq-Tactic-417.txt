Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where threat actors have already moved laterally using credentials obtained via Mimikatz and have executed commands on other systems. The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as they maintained interaction with the compromised server and executed further commands.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Lateral Movement (Tactic):** This tactic involves moving from one asset to another to access other parts of the network.
- **Techniques:**
  - **T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally.
  - **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to other systems to maintain access and control.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the described sequence of actions. It involves the development of resources or capabilities, which does not align with the maintenance of interaction and further command execution.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
  - While the question mentions lateral movement, the focus is on the next step after the initial lateral movement. Lateral movement is more about the initial phase of moving from one system to another, not the ongoing interaction and command execution.

- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
  - This tactic involves the initial entry into a network. The question already assumes that initial access has occurred and that lateral movement has taken place. Therefore, this is not the correct choice.

- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - This tactic involves maintaining control over a compromised system or network. The question describes maintaining interaction with the compromised server and executing further commands, which aligns perfectly with the Command and Control tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where threat actors have already moved laterally and executed commands.
- The next step involves maintaining interaction with the compromised server and executing further commands.
- The Command and Control tactic (D) is the most appropriate for this scenario, as it involves the ongoing interaction and control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: D**
