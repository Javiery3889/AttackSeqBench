Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where T9000 (a hypothetical adversary) has communicated with a C2 server using encrypted traffic to relay collected information. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to securely move the stolen data out of the victim environment.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data at a scheduled time, which can be used to exfiltrate data securely.
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the scenario where T9000 is using a C2 server to relay information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic is about gaining higher-level access within a system, which is not directly related to moving data out of the environment.
- **Answer Choice B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is also not directly related to moving data out of the environment.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the adversary's control over a victim's systems, which is more about maintaining access rather than moving data out.
- **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration** - This tactic directly involves the transfer of data from the victim's environment to an external location. The related TTPs (T1029 and T1041) both align with this tactic, especially since the question mentions using a C2 server to relay information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where data is being relayed to a C2 server, which is a form of exfiltration.
- The related TTPs mention techniques for exfiltration, specifically T1029 and T1041, which involve using scheduled transfers and C2 channels, respectively.
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described scenario is the exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
