Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Using credential-stealing modules (T1003).
2. Monitoring IIS network traffic to collect administration data (T1040).

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This indicates that the attacker is monitoring network traffic to collect data.
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1057-Process Discovery**: This indicates that the attacker is looking for information about processes and their memory usage.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic is about gathering data, which is what the attacker is doing with the credential-stealing modules and network sniffing. However, it does not specifically address the process and memory discovery.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic is about identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. T1057-Process Discovery is a specific technique under this tactic, which aligns with the question's requirement to locate processes and memory utilization.
- **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic is about gathering information to be used for future attacks. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not as specific to the process and memory discovery as the Discovery tactic.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target system. It does not align with the process and memory discovery described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions that are part of the attacker's initial steps to gather data and monitor the system.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1057-Process Discovery, which is a technique under the Discovery tactic.
- The Discovery tactic (B) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the need to locate processes and memory utilization, which is the final step in the sequence described.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
