Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group:
1. Utilized backdoor malware packed with Themida to execute remote commands.
2. Deployed Hermes ransomware to disrupt the FEIB's operations.

We need to identify the tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of the backdoor malware and before the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1053.002-At**: This suggests the malware was used to execute commands.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This indicates the development and use of malware.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1027.002-Software Packing**: This indicates the malware was packed with Themida to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the establishment and maintenance of the interaction between an attacker and a compromised system. While it is a plausible tactic, it is more likely to occur after the malware is deployed and before the ransomware is deployed.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by the defender. The use of Themida for packing the malware is a form of defense evasion. However, this is more of a technique rather than a tactic.
- **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the attacker. Deploying Hermes ransomware to disrupt operations is a clear example of this tactic.
- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is a common tactic, it is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor malware packed with Themida was used to execute remote commands, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic.
- The next step in the sequence is the deployment of Hermes ransomware to disrupt operations, which aligns with the **Impact** tactic.

Given the sequence of events and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the execution of the backdoor malware and before the deployment of Hermes ransomware is **Impact**.

### Final Answer: C: Impact
