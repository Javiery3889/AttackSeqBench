Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. Domain administrator passwords were compromised.
2. Access to all active domain accounts was gained.
3. Metasploit was used for system reconnaissance.
4. Progression to other networks occurred.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access**: Technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts (compromising domain accounts)
- **Privilege Escalation**: Technique T1078.002-Domain Accounts (gaining access to all active domain accounts)

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial compromise and before the use of Metasploit for reconnaissance.

- **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the creation and running of code, typically to execute a payload. It doesn't fit the sequence as it would come after reconnaissance and exploitation.
- **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. While it's related to the initial compromise, it doesn't fit the sequence as it would be part of the initial access phase.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It fits the sequence as it comes after gaining access to all active domain accounts and before using Metasploit for reconnaissance.
- **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves stealing data from the network. It would typically come after reconnaissance and exploitation, not before.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts. This aligns with the **Privilege Escalation** tactic.
2. The next step would be to move laterally within the network to other systems, which is the **Lateral Movement** tactic.
3. After gaining access to other systems, the attackers would use Metasploit for system reconnaissance and further progression.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer: C
