Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Longhorn's malware conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery for espionage purposes.
2. This was followed by an action that is not explicitly stated but is before communicating with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
- **Technique: T1071.001 - Web Protocols**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described:

- **A: Defense Evasion**
  - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly follow the detailed system fingerprinting and discovery phase.
  
- **B: Collection**
  - This tactic involves gathering information and data. After conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery, the next logical step would be to collect the data that was discovered. This aligns well with the espionage purpose mentioned in the question.
  
- **C: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying the network and systems to be targeted. Since the question states that detailed system fingerprinting and discovery have already occurred, this step has already been completed.
  
- **D: Privilege Escalation**
  - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to systems. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the data collection phase that follows the discovery phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery.
- The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect the data that was discovered.
- Communicating with C&C servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS is a command and control activity, which typically occurs after data collection.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Collection, which directly follows the discovery phase and precedes the command and control activity.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
