Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events:
1. Employees were socially engineered to enable macros.
2. BlackEnergy 3 malware was installed.
3. Adversaries began using BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This suggests that the malware is moving laterally within the network.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This indicates that the adversaries used a spearphishing service to gather information.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This technique involves using a spearphishing link to gain initial access to the network.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the communication between the malware and an external server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. Given that the malware is installed and adversaries are using plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement, it is logical that the malware would need to communicate with an external server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources. While discovery is part of the overall attack, it does not directly facilitate communication between the malware and an external server.

- **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the adversary causing harm or damage to the network. While this is a potential outcome, it does not directly address the communication aspect.

- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering data. While data collection is a part of the attack, it does not directly address the communication aspect.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the installation of malware and subsequent actions like credential harvesting and lateral movement.
- The communication between the malware and an external server is a critical part of the attack, as the malware needs to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
- Among the given options, **Command and Control (C2)** is the most relevant tactic that directly addresses the communication aspect.

### Final Answer: A: Command and Control
