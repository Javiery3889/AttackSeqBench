Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions that Harvester attempted to blend its malicious command and control activities with legitimate network traffic by leveraging CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure. This indicates that the attacker is trying to evade detection by making their activities appear as normal traffic.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location**: This technique involves using legitimate names or locations to blend in with normal traffic, which aligns with the question's description of blending malicious activities with legitimate network traffic.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for command and control, which could be related to the use of CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using domain fronting to hide the true destination of network traffic, which is also related to blending malicious activities with legitimate traffic.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. While it is a common tactic, the question specifically mentions blending activities with legitimate traffic, which is more closely related to the techniques of Defense Evasion and Command and Control.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target. While this is relevant, the question focuses on the blending of activities, which is more closely related to the techniques of Defense Evasion and Command and Control.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to additional systems. This is not directly related to the blending of activities with legitimate traffic.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or response by the defender. The techniques mentioned (T1036.005, T1665, T1090.004) are all related to evading detection by blending malicious activities with legitimate traffic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes blending malicious activities with legitimate network traffic, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
- The related TTPs include techniques that directly support this blending, such as T1036.005 (matching legitimate names or locations), T1665 (hiding infrastructure), and T1090.004 (domain fronting).
- The Command and Control tactic is also relevant, but the specific techniques mentioned in the question are more closely aligned with Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
