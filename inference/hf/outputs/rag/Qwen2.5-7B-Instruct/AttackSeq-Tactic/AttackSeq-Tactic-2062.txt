Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Hi-Zor RAT using string-stacking and double XOR encoding.
2. Sending a victim's Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools.
- **T1132.001-Standard Encoding (Technique):** This is a form of encoding used to evade detection.
- **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File (Technique):** This involves encoding or encrypting files to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **String-stacking and double XOR encoding:** These are forms of encoding or encryption, which fall under the category of **Defense Evasion**.
- **Sending Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection:** This is a form of **Command and Control** as it involves communication between the attacker and the compromised system.

Given this, the sequence of TTPs should be:
1. **Defense Evasion** (encoding/encryption)
2. **Command and Control** (secure communication)

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** Hi-Zor RAT uses string-stacking and double XOR encoding (Defense Evasion).
- **Step 2:** The encoded information is then sent through a secure TLS connection (Command and Control).

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Defense Evasion** (encoding/encryption) followed by **Command and Control** (secure communication).

### Final Answer: C (Defense Evasion) and D (Command and Control)
