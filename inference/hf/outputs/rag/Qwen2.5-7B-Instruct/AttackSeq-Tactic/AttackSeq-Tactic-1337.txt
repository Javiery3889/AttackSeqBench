Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where BlackEnergy malware was activated, and then operators assessed targets by deploying a specific variant. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the malware was activated.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**: This technique involves the adversary using environmental factors to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: T1587.001-Malware**: This technique involves the adversary developing or modifying malware.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves the adversary compromising a system through a drive-by download.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the capability to direct the compromised system.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system.
- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to access systems or networks.

Given the context of the question, the sequence of events described is:
1. BlackEnergy malware was activated.
2. Operators assessed targets by deploying a specific variant.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Activation of Malware**: This aligns with the **Execution** tactic, as it involves running malicious code.
2. **Assessment and Deployment of a Variant**: This suggests the adversary is actively using the malware to gather information and deploy additional components. This aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic, as it involves maintaining the capability to direct the compromised system and deploy additional components.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Execution** (Activation of BlackEnergy malware)
- **Command and Control** (Assessment and deployment of a variant)

Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is:
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
