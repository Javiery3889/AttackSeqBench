Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Execution of a modular backdoor (lightSpy) to enable spying and full control over the infected iOS device.
2. Silent patching of Safari.
3. Exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is not directly relevant to the actions described in the question, as the initial access has already occurred with the execution of the lightSpy backdoor.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This is relevant as the attackers are trying to maintain control and evade detection.
- **Execution (Tactic):** This is relevant as the attackers are exploiting Safari, which is an execution of code.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A):** This tactic is not directly relevant to the actions described, as the question does not mention collecting data or information.
- **Execution (B):** This is relevant as the attackers are exploiting Safari, which is an execution of code.
- **Defense Evasion (C):** This is highly relevant as the attackers are trying to maintain control and evade detection.
- **Credential Access (D):** This tactic is not directly relevant to the actions described, as the question does not mention accessing credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The execution of the lightSpy backdoor is a form of initial access, which has already occurred.
2. The silent patching of Safari and the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 are actions that fall under the tactic of **Defense Evasion**. These actions are designed to maintain control and evade detection.
3. The execution of the exploit (CVE-2019-8605) is a form of **Execution**.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **Defense Evasion** followed by **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
