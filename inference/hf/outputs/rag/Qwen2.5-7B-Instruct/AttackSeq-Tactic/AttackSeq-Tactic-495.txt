Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where remote administration tools are used to gain system administrators' credentials. After this, the cybercriminals explore the financial systems of the targeted organization. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the exploration of the financial systems.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering credentials, which aligns with the question's mention of gaining system administrators' credentials.
- **Tactic: Impact, Technique: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves stealing financial data, which aligns with the exploration of financial systems.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves modifying email forwarding rules, which is not directly related to the question's context.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
  - Persistence is about maintaining access to the target system over time. While it could be a tactic used after gaining credentials, it is not the most direct precursor to exploring financial systems.
- **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
  - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack. Gaining credentials (T1589.001) is a form of reconnaissance, and it directly precedes the exploration of financial systems (T1657).
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**
  - Execution involves running malicious code or commands. While this is part of the attack sequence, it is not the most direct precursor to exploring financial systems.
- **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
  - Defense Evasion involves avoiding detection by the target's defenses. This is not the most direct precursor to exploring financial systems.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes gaining credentials, which is a form of reconnaissance.
- The related TTPs confirm that T1589.001 (gaining credentials) is a technique under the Reconnaissance tactic.
- The exploration of financial systems (T1657) is a technique under the Impact tactic, which logically follows after gaining credentials.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Reconnaissance (gaining credentials) occurred before the exploration of financial systems.

**Final Answer: B**
