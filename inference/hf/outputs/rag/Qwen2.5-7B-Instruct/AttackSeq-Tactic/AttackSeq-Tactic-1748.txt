Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where attackers have already evaded defenses using process hollowing and obfuscating the second-stage payload as an image file. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next in the sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This indicates that the attackers used process hollowing to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This suggests that the attackers might have used process hollowing to escalate privileges.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining a long-term presence in a network. While it is a common goal after evading defenses, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned (process hollowing and obfuscation).
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing channels to exfiltrate data or send commands to the compromised system. While it is a common goal, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned.
- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attackers developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned.
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attackers identifying and exploiting the target's network and systems. Given that the attackers have already evaded defenses and obfuscated their payload, the next logical step would be to discover the network and systems to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already used process hollowing to evade defenses and obfuscate their payload.
- The next logical step would be to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- The other options (Persistence, Command and Control, and Resource Development) are more about maintaining or controlling the compromised system, which would come after the initial discovery and exploitation.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
