Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials. After this, a specific action is taken on the stolen files with certain extensions, which are then uploaded to a C2 server. We need to determine which tactic most likely occurs before the files are uploaded.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection (T1005-Data from Local System)**: This tactic involves gathering data from the local system, which could include the stolen files.
- **Exfiltration (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This tactic involves transferring data to a remote system, which is the action of uploading the files to the C2 server.
- **Credential Access (T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie)**: This technique involves stealing web session cookies, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance**
  - Reconnaissance is about gathering information about the target. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described (stealing credentials and uploading files).
- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
  - This is the initial step where the backdoor steals the Google Chrome credentials. However, the question asks what happens before the files are uploaded, not the credential theft itself.
- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying the network and systems within the target environment. This could be part of the overall attack but is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering data from the local system, which aligns with the action of taking the stolen files with specific extensions and preparing them for upload to the C2 server.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials (Credential Access).
- The stolen files with specific extensions are then collected (Collection).
- These collected files are subsequently uploaded to the C2 server (Exfiltration).

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurs before the files are uploaded is Collection.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
