Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question mentions that after leveraging plugins for discovery on infected devices, SideCopy utilized modular plugins to steal browser passwords and perform keylogging tasks. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1056.001-Keylogging**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. It is unlikely to be the first step before stealing browser passwords and performing keylogging.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network. While it could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to the specific actions of stealing browser passwords and keylogging.
- **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While it is a critical step, it is not directly related to the specific actions of stealing browser passwords and keylogging.
- **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target system. Stealing browser passwords and performing keylogging are specific forms of data collection.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of modular plugins to steal browser passwords and perform keylogging tasks. These actions are directly related to the Collection tactic, as they involve gathering specific types of data.
- The related TTPs mention the Collection tactic and specifically the keylogging technique, which aligns with the described actions.
- The question implies that these actions are a result of some initial discovery or reconnaissance, which is a part of the Collection tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Collection tactic occurred before the described actions.

**Final Answer: D**
