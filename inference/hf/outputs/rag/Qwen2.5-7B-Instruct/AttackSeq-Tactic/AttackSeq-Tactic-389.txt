Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where VBA macros within malicious Word documents are executed, and then scripts from watering hole attacks start communicating with external servers. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic best fits the communication with external servers.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the Tactic "Execution" and the Technique "T1059.005-Visual Basic". This indicates that the initial phase involves the execution of VBA macros.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Execution** - This tactic is about the initial phase where the adversary executes malicious code. While the execution of VBA macros is part of this tactic, the question specifically mentions communication with external servers, which is a different phase.
- **B: Impact** - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction, or modification of data. The communication with external servers is not directly an impact but rather a means to achieve an impact.
- **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing a means to control the compromised system. Communication with external servers is a key component of Command and Control (C2) activities.
- **D: Initial Access** - This tactic is about how the adversary initially gains access to the target network. The execution of VBA macros is an initial access method, but the communication with external servers is a subsequent action.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of VBA macros (T1059.005-Visual Basic) is part of the initial access or execution phase.
- The communication with external servers is a critical step in the Command and Control (C2) phase, where the adversary establishes a means to control the compromised system and potentially exfiltrate data or issue further commands.

Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
