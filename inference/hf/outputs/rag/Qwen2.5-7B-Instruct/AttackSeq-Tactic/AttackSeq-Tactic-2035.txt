### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Dragonfly attackers used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to energy companies, allowing them to download Trojan software.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Initial Access" as the tactic, and the techniques include spear-phishing emails (both link and attachment forms).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about the attacker's preparation and resource gathering, which is not directly related to the initial access phase.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic is about maintaining control over the compromised system, which happens after initial access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding detection, which is also a post-initial access phase activity.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target, which is a precursor to the initial access phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the attackers would first gather information about their target (Reconnaissance) before using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the spear-phishing emails were used is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
