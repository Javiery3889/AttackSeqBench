Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
1. Delivering Gh0st RAT via email.
2. Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system.
- **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by security measures.

The related techniques specifically mention:
- **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique is used to load a malicious DLL, which aligns with the second part of the sequence in the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic best fits the sequence of TTPs:
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the initial entry into a network or system. Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is an example of initial access.
- **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves developing resources for an attack, which doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves running malicious code or commands. Employing DLL side-loading to load a malicious DLL is an example of execution.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. It doesn't directly fit the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access (A)**: Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is a form of initial access.
2. **Execution (C)**: Employing DLL side-loading to load a malicious DLL is a form of execution.

The sequence described in the question involves moving from initial access to execution. The related TTPs confirm that DLL side-loading is a technique under the Execution tactic.

### Final Answer: C
