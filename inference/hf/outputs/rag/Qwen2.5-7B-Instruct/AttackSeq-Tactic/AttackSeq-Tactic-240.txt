Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where data collected by W32.Flamer is encrypted and transferred to C&C servers. The next step in the sequence is to ensure the stolen data is archived and downloadable by operators.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves using a utility to archive data.
- **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data.
- **T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This technique involves staging data remotely for later access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining access to the target network. It does not directly relate to archiving or making data downloadable.
- **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic is about transferring data from the target to the attacker. While it involves data transfer, it does not specifically address archiving or making the data downloadable.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic is about avoiding detection by the defender. It does not align with the task of archiving and making data downloadable.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic is about moving within the network to gain access to other systems. It does not relate to archiving or making data downloadable.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where data is encrypted and transferred to C&C servers, and the next step is to ensure the data is archived and downloadable by operators.
- The related TTPs specifically mention techniques for archiving collected data and making it downloadable.
- Among the answer choices, **T1560-Archive Collected Data** and **T1560.001-Archive via Utility** are directly related to archiving and making data downloadable.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to ensure the stolen data is archived and downloadable by operators, which aligns with the **T1560-Archive Collected Data** technique.

### Final Answer: C
