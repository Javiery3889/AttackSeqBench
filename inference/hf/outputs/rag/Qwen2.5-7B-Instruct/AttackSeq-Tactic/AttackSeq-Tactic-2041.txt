Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers gathered credentials and system information from Windows systems.
2. This occurred during the "discovery" phase.
3. The next step was using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to hop among systems within the victim network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Discovery**: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- **Reconnaissance**: This is a broader tactic that includes gathering information about the target.
- **Credential Access**: T1187-Forced Authentication

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining initial access to the network, which typically precedes the discovery phase.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network, which aligns with the use of RDP to hop among systems.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, which aligns with the gathering of credentials and system information.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the gathering of credentials.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access (A)**: This is not the correct answer because the question states that the discovery phase has already occurred.
2. **Lateral Movement (B)**: This is the correct answer because it follows the discovery phase and involves moving from one system to another using RDP.
3. **Discovery (C)**: This is not the correct answer because the question states that the discovery phase has already occurred.
4. **Credential Access (D)**: This is not the correct answer because the question states that the credentials have already been gathered.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B
