Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the group Earth Lusca:
1. Acquiring credentials using tools like Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit.
2. Scanning the compromised network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the actions described in the question:
- **Resource Development**: Technique T1588.002-Tool
- **Reconnaissance**: Technique T1589.001-Credentials
- **Lateral Movement**: Technique T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials, which is already described in the first part of the question. It does not fit the second part of the question, which involves scanning the network.
- **Lateral Movement (A)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While it could be part of the overall attack, the question specifically mentions scanning the network, which is more closely related to reconnaissance.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves identifying the network and its components, which aligns well with the scanning activities mentioned in the question.
- **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves developing tools and resources, which is not directly related to the scanning activities described in the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access (C)**: This is the first step, where the group acquires credentials.
2. **Discovery (B)**: After acquiring credentials, the group scans the network environment, which is a form of discovery to identify the network and its components.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Discovery, as it directly aligns with the scanning activities described in the question.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
