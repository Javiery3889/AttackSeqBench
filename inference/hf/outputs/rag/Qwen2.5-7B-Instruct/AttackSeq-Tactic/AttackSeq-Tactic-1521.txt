Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that Whitefly uses tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials and compromises machines. It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before they used stolen credentials to expand their control within the network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Credential Access (T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials using network poisoning techniques.
- **Reconnaissance (T1589.001-Credentials)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network and its users, which can include credentials.
- **Initial Access (T1078-Valid Accounts)**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the network using valid accounts.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the network. While it is a critical step, it is not directly related to the immediate use of stolen credentials.
- **Lateral Movement (B)**: This tactic involves moving from one part of the network to another. It typically follows the use of stolen credentials to gain access to other systems.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic directly involves stealing credentials, which aligns with the question's description of using tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves identifying the network's resources and structure. While it is a crucial step, it is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of Mimikatz to harvest credentials, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.
- The next step in the sequence would be to use these stolen credentials to expand control within the network, which aligns with the **Lateral Movement** tactic.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Credential Access** (stealing credentials) occurred before **Lateral Movement** (using stolen credentials to expand control).

### Final Answer: B
