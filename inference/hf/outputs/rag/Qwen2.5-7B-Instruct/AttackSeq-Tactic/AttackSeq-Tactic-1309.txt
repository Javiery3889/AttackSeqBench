Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Establishing communication with C2 servers using hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files.
2. Directing KernelBot implants to target Next Media websites.
3. Resulting in a 'total failure' of their network.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
- Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1008-Fallback Channels

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a network or system. While it is relevant to the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly describe the communication or failure aspect mentioned in the question.
- **Impact (B)**: This tactic is about causing harm or disruption to the target. The question mentions a 'total failure' of the network, which aligns with the concept of impact.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic is about avoiding detection or response. While it is relevant to the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly describe the communication or failure aspect mentioned in the question.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic is about the attackers controlling the compromised systems. The question mentions establishing communication with C2 servers and directing the bots, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic. However, the question also mentions a 'total failure' of the network, which is more aligned with the Impact tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the attackers establishing communication with C2 servers and directing the bots to target Next Media websites. This aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- However, the question also mentions a 'total failure' of the network, which is more aligned with the Impact tactic. The Impact tactic describes the consequences of the attack, such as network disruption or failure.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Impact tactic, as it directly addresses the 'total failure' of the network.

### Final Answer: B: Impact
