Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where:
1. NanHaiShu communicates system information to its C&C servers through HTTP POST requests.
2. NanHaiShu switches to a Chinese IP address for dynamic DNS-based Command and Control.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols for command and control.
- **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain persistence or evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the actions described in the question.

- **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources that can be used to further an attack. It is unlikely to be the first step before communicating system information and switching to a C&C server.
- **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources used in an attack. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the specific actions described.
- **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. Communicating system information to a C&C server is a form of data collection. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this action.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the means to direct an adversary's access to and use of compromised resources. The actions described (HTTP POST requests and switching to a Chinese IP address) are directly related to Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The actions described (HTTP POST requests and switching to a Chinese IP address) are part of the Command and Control tactic.
- **Step 2**: The question asks for the tactic that occurred before these actions.
- **Step 3**: Collection (T1033) is a tactic that involves gathering information, which is a logical step before communicating this information to a C&C server.

Given the context and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Collection occurred before the actions described.

### Final Answer: C
