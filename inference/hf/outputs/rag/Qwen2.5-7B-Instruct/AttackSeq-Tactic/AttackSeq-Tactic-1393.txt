Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Lateral movement through shared MSP infrastructure has occurred.
2. Systems of interest have been identified.
3. Data is staged for exfiltration in multi-part archives.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1560-Archive Collected Data**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement (A)**: This is the initial phase where the attacker moves through the network. It is not directly related to staging data for exfiltration.
- **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial part of an attack, it is not directly related to the staging of data for exfiltration.
- **Impact (C)**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect of the attack. It is not directly related to the staging of data for exfiltration.
- **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information or data from the target. The related techniques T1074.002-Remote Data Staging and T1560-Archive Collected Data are directly related to the staging and archiving of collected data, which aligns with the question.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the attacker moving laterally and identifying systems of interest, which aligns with the initial phase of the attack.
2. The next step is to stage the data for exfiltration, which is a part of the Collection tactic.
3. The related TTPs specifically mention techniques for staging and archiving collected data, which aligns with the question's description of multi-part archives.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the Collection tactic, as it directly involves the staging and archiving of data for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D**
