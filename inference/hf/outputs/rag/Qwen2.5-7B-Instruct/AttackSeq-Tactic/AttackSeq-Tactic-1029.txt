Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where TidePool malware has achieved persistence by using an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry.
   - Next, the malware communicates with a domain 'goback.strangled[.]net' to execute remote commands.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention techniques related to persistence and defense evasion.
   - Specifically, the techniques T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder and T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution are related to persistence.
   - The technique T1112-Modify Registry is also related to persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks what tactic most likely occurred next after achieving persistence.
   - The next action described is the malware communicating with a remote domain to execute remote commands.
   - This action aligns with the Tactic of Command and Control (C2), which involves the establishment and maintenance of the malicious actor's ability to direct the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible next tactic after achieving persistence is Command and Control.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is C: Command and Control.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
