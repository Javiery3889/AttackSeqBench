Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The malware actors collect email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI.
2. They then send the collected data to their infrastructure through a POST web request.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment.
  - **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: This technique is relevant to the first part of the sequence, where the malware collects email accounts.
- **Command and Control**: This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
  - **T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique is relevant to the second part of the sequence, where the collected data is sent to the attacker's infrastructure using a POST web request.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
  - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It does not fit the sequence as the question describes actions after the initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
  - This tactic fits the second part of the sequence, where the collected data is sent to the attacker's infrastructure. However, it does not cover the first part of the sequence, which is the collection of email accounts.
- **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location. The second part of the sequence (sending the collected data to the attacker's infrastructure) aligns with this tactic.
- **Answer Choice D: Collection**
  - This tactic fits the first part of the sequence, where the malware collects email accounts. However, it does not cover the second part of the sequence, which is the exfiltration of the collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first part of the sequence (collecting email accounts) is covered by the **Collection** tactic.
- The second part of the sequence (sending the collected data to the attacker's infrastructure) is covered by the **Exfiltration** tactic.
- The question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs, and the second part of the sequence (sending the collected data) is the focus of the question.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
