Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Backdoor malware is embedded within trusted software.
2. This occurs on victims' machines.
3. The malware is executed.
4. Before gathering information and credentials, another tactic is performed.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic)**: This is the initial phase of gathering information about the target.
- **T1589.001-Credentials (Technique)**: This technique involves stealing or gathering credentials.
- **Discovery (Tactic)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information and resources.
- **Software Discovery (Technique)**: This technique involves identifying software on the target system.
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
- **Steganography (Technique)**: This technique involves hiding information within other non-secret text or data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurs before the malware gathers information and credentials. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the establishment of a channel for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system. It typically occurs after the malware has been installed and is not directly related to the initial steps of reconnaissance or discovery.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is a common tactic, it is not directly related to the initial steps of reconnaissance or discovery.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information and resources. It is a logical step before gathering credentials, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to identify valuable targets.
- **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of resources to support the attack. It is not directly related to the initial steps of reconnaissance or discovery.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is embedded within trusted software and executed on the victim's machine.
- The next step before gathering credentials is to understand the environment.
- **Discovery (Tactic)** involves identifying and classifying information and resources, which is a logical step before gathering credentials.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
