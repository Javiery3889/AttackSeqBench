Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Gamaredon used scripting (Batch files and VBScript) to execute payloads from C&C servers. This implies that the tactic in question should precede the use of scripting for payload execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide information about techniques under the Execution tactic:
- T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1059.003-Windows Command Shell
- T1059.005-Visual Basic

These techniques are all related to the use of scripts and command interpreters for execution, which aligns with the question's focus on scripting.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about avoiding or reducing the effectiveness of defensive measures. While it can be a part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the use of scripting for payload execution.
- **B: Execution** - This tactic encompasses the techniques used to run malicious code. The related TTPs (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1059.003-Windows Command Shell, T1059.005-Visual Basic) are all under the Execution tactic. However, the question asks what occurred before the use of scripting, not what was used for scripting.
- **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. It is a prerequisite for any further actions, including the use of scripting for payload execution. This fits the sequence as it logically precedes the use of scripting.
- **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. While it is a part of an attack, it does not directly precede the use of scripting for payload execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the use of scripting for payload execution.
- The related TTPs are all under the Execution tactic, which includes the use of scripting.
- Initial Access (C) is a prerequisite for any further actions, including the use of scripting for payload execution.
- Defense Evasion (A) and Lateral Movement (D) do not directly precede the use of scripting for payload execution.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
