Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting have already occurred.
2. The next step involves using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Credential Access
- Technique: T1003.001-LSASS Memory

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the described sequence. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) is about establishing and maintaining the channels for communication between the attacker and the compromised system. It is not directly related to the initial steps of credential harvesting or gathering information on network and host configurations.

- **B: Discovery**
  - Discovery involves identifying the network and system resources. This could include gathering information on network and host configurations, which aligns with the next step in the sequence.

- **C: Reconnaissance**
  - Reconnaissance is similar to Discovery but is more focused on gathering information about the target environment. It can include activities like network scanning and enumeration, which could precede the credential harvesting and information gathering steps.

- **D: Credential Access**
  - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as having occurred. This tactic is not the one that precedes the next steps.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where credential harvesting (T1003.001-LSASS Memory) has already occurred.
- The next step involves gathering information on network and host configurations, which is a form of Discovery or Reconnaissance.
- Among the options, Discovery (B) is more specific to gathering detailed information about the network and host, which aligns well with the next step in the sequence.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
