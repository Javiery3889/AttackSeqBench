Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Defense evasion techniques (deleting files and disabling security tools) are employed.
2. Sednit gathers information about credentials using dumpers to target browser databases and email clients.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- **Tactic: Credential Access**
  - **Technique: T1555.003-Credentials from Web Browsers**
  - **Technique: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the credential access techniques mentioned in the question.

- **Credential Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to obtain credentials, such as passwords, tokens, or other forms of authentication.
- **Collection (Tactic)**: This tactic involves gathering information and data, which can include credentials.
- **Resource Development (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to develop and maintain the resources needed for the attack.
- **Discovery (Tactic)**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to identify and locate resources and systems.

Given the sequence described in the question, the adversary first employs defense evasion techniques, which are a precursor to the actual credential gathering process. The credential gathering process involves both OS credential dumping and credentials from web browsers.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion**: This is the initial step where the adversary deletes files and disables security tools.
2. **Discovery**: After evading defenses, the adversary likely discovers the systems and resources they need to target.
3. **Collection**: The adversary then collects credentials using various methods, including OS credential dumping and credentials from web browsers.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Defense Evasion → Discovery → Collection

Among the given answer choices, the tactic that best fits the sequence before the actual credential access techniques is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
