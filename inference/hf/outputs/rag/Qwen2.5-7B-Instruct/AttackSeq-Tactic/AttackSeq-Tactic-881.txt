Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first gather network information using ADFind and port scanning.
   - The next step in the sequence is the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention two techniques under the Discovery tactic:
     - T1018-Remote System Discovery
     - T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
   - Both of these techniques are related to gathering information about the network and systems, which aligns with the initial actions described in the question.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic involves identifying and classifying information about the network and its resources. While the initial actions (ADFind and port scanning) are part of discovery, the propagation of beacons is not directly a discovery activity.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running code or commands on the target system. Propagating beacons to other systems is more about moving laterally and establishing a presence, which is not directly an execution activity.
   - **Defense Evasion (C):** This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender. While beacons can be used to evade detection, the propagation itself is not primarily about evasion.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. Propagating beacons to other systems is a clear example of lateral movement, as it involves moving to and establishing a presence on other systems within the network.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial actions (ADFind and port scanning) are part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The propagation of beacons to other systems within the network is a clear example of moving laterally to other systems, which is the definition of Lateral Movement.
   - None of the other options (Discovery, Execution, or Defense Evasion) directly describe the action of propagating beacons to other systems.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
