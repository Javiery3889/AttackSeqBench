Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions in an attack:
1. Compromised web servers are prepared to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
2. This is part of resource development.
3. Before tricking users into executing the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention the following:
- **Defense Evasion**: Technique T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
- **Privilege Escalation**: Technique T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
- **Persistence**: Technique T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the preparation of compromised web servers and before the execution of the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The preparation of compromised web servers suggests that this has already occurred.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target's system. The execution of the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking is the final step in the sequence.
- **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering data from the target's system. There is no indication of data collection in the sequence described.
- **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the target's system. While this could be part of the initial access, it is not the most likely step after the preparation of compromised web servers and before the execution of the DLL.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The preparation of compromised web servers to host the ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts is part of resource development, which is a step in the attack lifecycle.
- The next step is to trick users into executing the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking, which is a form of execution.
- The related TTPs mention DLL Search Order Hijacking, which is a technique under the Execution tactic.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the preparation of compromised web servers and before the execution of the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking is Execution.

### Final Answer: B
