Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Naikon APT group:
1. Conducted discovery to gather system and network information.
2. Used the Aria-body backdoor to search for files.
3. Took screenshots.
4. Enumerated loaded modules.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide specific techniques and tactics:
- **Discovery**:
  - T1049: System Network Connections Discovery
  - T1083: File and Directory Discovery
- **Collection**:
  - T1113: Screen Capture

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: Command and Control**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the actions described in the question. The actions mentioned are more about gathering information and taking screenshots, which do not align with command and control activities.

- **B: Collection**
  - This tactic aligns well with the actions of taking screenshots (T1113) and enumerating loaded modules. However, it does not fully capture the initial discovery phase.

- **C: Discovery**
  - This tactic is directly related to the initial discovery phase, where the APT group gathers system and network information. The techniques T1049 and T1083 are specifically mentioned for this tactic.

- **D: Credential Access**
  - This tactic is not directly related to the actions described. The question does not mention any activities related to accessing credentials.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question starts with discovery, which is a clear indication that the APT group is gathering information.
2. The Aria-body backdoor is used to search for files and enumerate loaded modules, which are actions typically associated with the Discovery tactic.
3. Taking screenshots is a Collection activity, but it follows the initial Discovery phase.
4. The related TTPs confirm that Discovery (T1049, T1083) and Collection (T1113) are the relevant techniques.

Given the sequence of actions and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Discovery, followed by Collection.

### Final Answer: C
