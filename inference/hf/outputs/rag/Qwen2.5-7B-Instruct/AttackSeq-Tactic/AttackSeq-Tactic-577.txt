Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Higaisa distributed malicious LNK files disguised as CVs and IELTS results within RAR archives via spear-phishing.
2. This was followed by the LNK file initiating a multi-stage attack.
3. The multi-stage attack involved copying its content to a temporary directory and using 'certutil.exe' to decode a base64 blob.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spear-phishing attachment to deliver malware.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The question mentions spear-phishing, which is a method of initial access. However, the question is asking about what occurred after the initial access and before the execution of the multi-stage attack.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves the actual execution of the malware. The question describes the LNK file initiating a multi-stage attack, which aligns with the execution phase.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic is about developing and maintaining access to the target environment. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. While it could be part of a multi-stage attack, the question does not specifically mention credential access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing attack (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is the initial access.
- The LNK file being executed and initiating a multi-stage attack (T1204.002-Malicious File) is the execution phase.
- The use of 'certutil.exe' to decode a base64 blob (T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) is part of the execution phase, as it is a technique used to execute the payload.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
