Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving ShadowPad's initial deployment through DLL sideloading in a legitimate executable.
   - It mentions custom decryption algorithms and payload injection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensures the malware remains active even after system restarts or interruptions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" as a tactic and "DLL Side-Loading" as a technique.
   - DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) is a technique used to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can be used to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic is about gathering data from the target system. It does not directly address ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **Impact (B):** This tactic is about causing harm or damage to the target system. It does not directly address ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic is about running malicious code. While it is part of the initial deployment, it does not address ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic is specifically about maintaining access to the target system over time, even after system restarts or interruptions. DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) is a technique that can be used to achieve persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts or interruptions.
   - The related TTPs mention "Persistence" as a tactic and "DLL Side-Loading" as a technique.
   - DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) is a method to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can be used to maintain persistence.
   - None of the other tactics (Collection, Impact, Execution) directly address the need for the malware to remain active after system restarts.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
