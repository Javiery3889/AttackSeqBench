Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers gained access to the victim's systems via a watering hole attack exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
2. The next step is before the downloader leverages CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Privilege Escalation
- Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic (Command and Control, Initial Access, Execution, or Reconnaissance) fits best between the initial access and the privilege escalation.

- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about the initial entry into the target network. The question already mentions that the attackers gained access via a watering hole attack, so this step has already occurred.
- **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves the steps taken to run malicious code. While this could be a step before privilege escalation, it is not specifically mentioned in the question.
- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. This is typically an early step and not directly related to the sequence described.
- **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing a means to control the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it is not directly mentioned as occurring before the privilege escalation.

Given the sequence described, the step that logically follows gaining access and precedes privilege escalation is likely to be the execution of a payload or downloader. This aligns with the Execution tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers gained access via a watering hole attack (Initial Access).
2. The next step is the execution of a downloader or malicious code (Execution).
3. This downloader then leverages CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
