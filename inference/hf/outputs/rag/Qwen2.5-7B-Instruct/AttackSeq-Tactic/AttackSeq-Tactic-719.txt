Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Acquiring system details using the 'bs.dll' plugin through WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls.
2. Overwriting data on hard drives using the 'dstr.dll' plugin.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1082-System Information Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as system details, hardware details, and software details. This aligns with the first part of the sequence described in the question, where system details are acquired using various methods (WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls).

- **Execution**: This tactic involves the creation and running of code or scripts. While the question mentions the use of plugins ('bs.dll' and 'dstr.dll'), the primary focus is on the information gathering phase, not the execution phase.

- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by security tools. The question does not provide information that suggests the attacker is trying to evade detection, but rather focuses on the information gathering phase.

- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another. The question does not mention any movement to other systems, but rather focuses on the current system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial phase of the attack, which is the gathering of system details.
- The related TTPs specifically mention T1082-System Information Discovery, which aligns with the first part of the sequence.
- The subsequent action (overwriting data) is more aligned with the Execution tactic, but the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the system details were acquired and **before** the data was overwritten.

Given this analysis, the most plausible tactic that occurred after acquiring system details and before overwriting data is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
