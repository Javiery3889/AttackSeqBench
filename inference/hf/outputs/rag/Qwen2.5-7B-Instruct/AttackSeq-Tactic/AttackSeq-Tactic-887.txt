Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10:
1. Utilization of Mimikatz for credential theft.
2. Logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context on the tactics and techniques involved:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests that the attackers are using valid accounts to evade detection.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This indicates that the attackers initially gained access using valid accounts.
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1133-External Remote Services**: This suggests that the attackers are maintaining access through external remote services.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection (A)**: This tactic is about gathering information, which does not fit the sequence as it comes before the credential theft.
- **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic is about developing resources, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network, which could be a step after credential theft but before using valid accounts to log in.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which fits the first step of the sequence (using Mimikatz for credential theft).

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Credential Access (D)**: APT10 used Mimikatz for credential theft, which is a form of Credential Access.
2. **Lateral Movement (C)**: After obtaining credentials, the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network to reach the target (Visma network).
3. **Persistence (T1133-External Remote Services)**: Once in the network, the attackers might use external remote services to maintain persistence, but this is not the immediate next step after credential theft and before using valid accounts.

### Final Answer: 
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
Final Answer: C
