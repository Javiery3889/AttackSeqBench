Let's break down the question and the related TTPs to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions after establishing a foothold through remote exploitation of a Solaris server. The next steps mentioned are privilege escalation using tools like Mimikatz and backdoors such as SLAPSTICK.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Lateral Movement, Technique: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This TTP aligns with the initial remote exploitation of a Solaris server.
- **Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This TTP aligns with the privilege escalation step using tools like Mimikatz and backdoors such as SLAPSTICK.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**: This TTP is more about gaining initial access to a system, which is already described in the question as the remote exploitation of a Solaris server. The question is asking about the next step after this initial access.
- **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**: This TTP directly aligns with the next step mentioned in the question, which is the escalation of privileges using tools like Mimikatz and backdoors such as SLAPSTICK.
- **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This TTP is about maintaining access to the system over a longer period, which is not the immediate next step after privilege escalation.
- **Answer Choice D: Discovery**: This TTP is about identifying and classifying resources, which is not the immediate next step after privilege escalation.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions after initial access, which is already established.
- The next step is privilege escalation, which is directly aligned with the TTP of Privilege Escalation.
- The related TTPs confirm that the next step after initial access is privilege escalation.

**Final Answer: B: Privilege Escalation**
