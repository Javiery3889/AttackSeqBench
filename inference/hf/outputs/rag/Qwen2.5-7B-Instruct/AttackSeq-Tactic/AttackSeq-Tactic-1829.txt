Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained initial access to a system through a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via watering hole attacks. The next step involves the Poison Ivy RAT communicating with a domain like diff.qohub.info.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the initial step, where the attacker gained access through a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit.
- **T1189-Drive-by Compromise (Technique)**: This technique is related to the initial access method used, which is a drive-by compromise via a watering hole attack.

Given that the Poison Ivy RAT is communicating with a domain, the next logical step would be to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is a common method for maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access to the system through a drive-by compromise (watering hole attack and CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit).
2. **Command and Control (C2)**: The Poison Ivy RAT communicates with the domain (diff.qohub.info) to establish a C2 channel, allowing the attacker to maintain control and potentially exfiltrate data.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after initial access is Command and Control.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
