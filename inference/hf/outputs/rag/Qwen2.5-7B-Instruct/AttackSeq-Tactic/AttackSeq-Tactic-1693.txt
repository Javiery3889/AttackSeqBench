Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Shamoon malware:
1. The malware executed itself as a scheduled job.
2. It deleted the file created for the job.
3. It overwrote data and boot records to prevent system access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or interference from defensive measures.
- **File Deletion (Technique)**: This technique involves deleting files to evade detection or to disrupt the system.
- **Impact (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques that cause harm to the system, such as data destruction or denial of service.
- **Disk Structure Wipe (Technique)**: This technique involves overwriting the disk structure to prevent system access.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the wiping function overwrote data and boot records.

- **Defense Evasion (Tactic)**: This tactic is about evading detection and interference. While it is a crucial part of the malware's lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the wiping of data and boot records.
- **Persistence (Tactic)**: This tactic involves techniques that allow the malware to maintain long-term access to the system. Executing itself as a scheduled job is a form of persistence.
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance might be part of the initial stages, it is not directly related to the wiping of data and boot records.
- **Credential Access (Tactic)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials to gain access to the system. It is not directly related to the wiping of data and boot records.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware executed itself as a scheduled job, which is a form of **Persistence**.
- After executing, it deleted the file created for the job, which is a form of **Defense Evasion**.
- Finally, it overwrote data and boot records to prevent system access, which is a form of **Impact**.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the wiping function is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
