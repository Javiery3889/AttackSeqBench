Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence where:
1. Korplug collects extensive system information and data from local, removable, and network drives.
2. It then communicates with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Collection (Tactic):** This is the initial phase where data is gathered.
- **Fallback Channels (T1008):** This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system.
  - While it fits the context of communicating with fallback servers, it is not the immediate next step after data collection.
  
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
  - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment.
  - This is not the next step after data collection; it is the first step in the attack lifecycle.
  
- **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network.
  - This is not directly related to the communication with fallback servers.
  
- **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
  - This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the target environment.
  - Given that Korplug has already collected data and is now communicating with fallback servers, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the collected data.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** Korplug collects extensive system information and data.
- **Step 2:** It communicates with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols.
- **Step 3:** The purpose of this communication is to exfiltrate the collected data to a remote location.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
