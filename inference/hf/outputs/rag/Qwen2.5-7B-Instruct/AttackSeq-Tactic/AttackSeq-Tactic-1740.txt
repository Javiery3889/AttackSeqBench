Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell script is used to install LightNeuron on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - After the installation, LightNeuron uses `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` to determine system network configurations.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system.
   - **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to determine system network configurations.
   - The related TTPs indicate that the technique T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) is part of the Discovery tactic, and T1059.001 (PowerShell) is part of the Execution tactic.
   - Since the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the execution of the functions to determine system network configurations, we need to identify the tactic that precedes the Execution tactic in the sequence of actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used a PowerShell script (T1059.001) to install LightNeuron, which is part of the Execution tactic.
   - Before executing the PowerShell script, the attackers would need to gather information about the network configuration of the target system, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the functions to determine system network configurations is Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
