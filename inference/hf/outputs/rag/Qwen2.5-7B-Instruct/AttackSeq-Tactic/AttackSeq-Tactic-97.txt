Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT-TOCS:
1. Utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
2. Remote control of targeted systems.
3. Execution in memory to evade detection via operations without hard disk writing.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Execution
- Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the execution of PowerShell scripts and before the in-memory execution to evade detection.

- **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell scripts or in-memory execution.
- **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network, which is typically before the execution of PowerShell scripts.
- **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the running of code or scripts, which aligns with the execution of PowerShell scripts.
- **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the removal of data from the target, which is typically after the data has been compromised and is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell scripts or in-memory execution.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access** (B) is the first step, where the attacker gains initial access to the target system.
2. **Execution** (C) follows, where the attacker uses PowerShell to execute Shellcode scripts.
3. **Execution in Memory** (which is a subtechnique of Execution) is the next step, where the scripts are executed in memory to evade detection.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurs after the execution of PowerShell scripts and before in-memory execution is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C
