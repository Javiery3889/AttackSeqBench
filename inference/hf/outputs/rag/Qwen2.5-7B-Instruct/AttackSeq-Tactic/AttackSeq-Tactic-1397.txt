Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT10 achieved persistence on victim networks using scheduled tasks or Windows services, following the deployment of malware such as PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.005-Scheduled Task
- Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1053.002-At

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic (Resource Development, Defense Evasion, Execution, or Initial Access) logically precedes the persistence tactic.

- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of tools, resources, and infrastructure. While it is a valid tactic, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. It is more about hiding activities rather than the initial steps leading to persistence.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts. It is a step that can lead to persistence, but it is not the first step in the sequence.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It is the first step in the attack lifecycle and logically precedes the deployment of malware and subsequent persistence.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT10 would need to gain initial access to the network to deploy malware.
2. **Execution**: Once access is gained, the malware (PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT) is executed to establish remote access.
3. **Persistence**: The malware then achieves persistence by creating scheduled tasks or Windows services to ensure it remains active even after a system restart.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurs before persistence is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
