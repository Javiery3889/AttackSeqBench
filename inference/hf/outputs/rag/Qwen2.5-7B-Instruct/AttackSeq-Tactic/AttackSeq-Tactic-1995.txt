Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already harvested credentials using the Responder tool. The next step in the sequence is establishing network share and system information enumeration. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide additional context:
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves sniffing network traffic to gather information about the network.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique is similar to the previous one but is categorized under Credential Access.
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning network protocols to steal credentials.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code and the creation and use of malware. It does not directly relate to the harvesting of credentials or the subsequent network share and system information enumeration.
- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the network and the systems within it. Techniques like T1040-Network Sniffing and T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are relevant here, as they help the attackers understand the network and gather credentials.
- **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the network or system over time. It does not directly relate to the initial steps of harvesting credentials and network reconnaissance.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question. The next step after credential access would be to use the credentials to gather more information.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the attackers have harvested credentials using the Responder tool.
- The next step is to establish network share and system information enumeration.
- The related TTPs mention techniques like T1040-Network Sniffing and T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay, which are under the Discovery tactic.
- These techniques help the attackers understand the network and gather more information, which is necessary before they can establish network shares and system information enumeration.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
