Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. SparrowDoor (a specific TTP) establishes an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server.
2. This connection is used for data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: This technique involves using the command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.
- **Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol)**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel that is not a C2 channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. It does not fit the sequence as it precedes the establishment of the connection.
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information that could be used for further attacks. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the use of the C2 channel for exfiltration.
- **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment. It is also not directly related to the use of the C2 channel for exfiltration.
- **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the C2 channel. The question mentions that SparrowDoor established an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server, which aligns with this tactic.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the establishment of the encrypted HTTPS connection and just before data exfiltration took place over the same channel.

Final Answer: D
