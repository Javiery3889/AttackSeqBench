Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by StellarParticle:
1. Using AdFind and custom tooling to identify information from Active Directory and systems.
2. Preparing to interrogate other infrastructure for additional access pathways.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery
- Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Tactic: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent actions.
  - The actions described (using AdFind and custom tooling to gather information) align well with the Discovery tactic.
- **Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering remote systems and their services.
  - The question mentions gathering information from Active Directory and systems, which is consistent with remote system discovery.

### Step 4: Determine the Sequence
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the initial gathering of information. The actions described (gathering information from Active Directory and systems) are part of the Discovery tactic. The next logical step would be to use this information to further interrogate other infrastructure, which aligns with the Discovery tactic as well.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred after the initial gathering of information. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D: Discovery
