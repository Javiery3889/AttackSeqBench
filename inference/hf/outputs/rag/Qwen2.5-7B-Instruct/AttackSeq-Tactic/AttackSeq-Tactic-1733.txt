Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the initial step involves defense evasion techniques like self-deletion based on a hardcoded date. The next step is gathering detailed information such as IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files based on specific criteria, which aligns with the self-deletion based on a hardcoded date mentioned in the question.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1480-Execution Guardrails**: This technique involves controlling the execution environment to avoid detection, which is also a form of defense evasion.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying information to be used for future attacks. While it could be relevant, it does not directly align with the self-deletion technique mentioned.
- **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is already mentioned in the question and includes the self-deletion technique. However, it does not directly address the gathering of detailed information.
- **Answer Choice C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It does not directly align with the gathering of detailed information.
- **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It aligns well with the gathering of detailed information such as IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence where the first step is defense evasion (self-deletion based on a hardcoded date).
- The next step is gathering detailed information, which is a key aspect of reconnaissance.
- While defense evasion is involved, the primary focus of the sequence is on the gathering of detailed information, which is a core component of reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
