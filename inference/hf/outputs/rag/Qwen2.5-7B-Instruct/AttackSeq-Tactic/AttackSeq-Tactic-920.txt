Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. **Packrat evaded antivirus detection using obfuscation techniques and runtime packers.**
2. **Used its infrastructure to host domains communicating with malware on targeted systems.**

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Defense Evasion (Tactic):** This tactic includes techniques for evading detection and defense mechanisms.
- **T1027.002-Software Packing (Technique):** This technique involves using runtime packers to obfuscate the malware.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (Technique):** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence described in the question:

- **A: Discovery**
  - Discovery is about the adversary learning information about the target environment. While this could be a step before the described actions, it is not directly related to the evasion and communication aspects described.
  
- **B: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels to control the compromised systems. The question mentions using infrastructure to host domains communicating with malware, which aligns with C2.
  
- **C: Defense Evasion**
  - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and interference by defensive measures. The question describes evading antivirus detection and using obfuscation techniques, which are directly related to Defense Evasion.
  
- **D: Collection**
  - Collection involves gathering information from the target. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the evasion and communication aspects described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes evading antivirus detection and using obfuscation techniques, which are directly related to the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The question also mentions using infrastructure to host domains communicating with malware, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- However, the sequence of actions described in the question starts with evasion and then moves to communication, making Defense Evasion the initial tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
