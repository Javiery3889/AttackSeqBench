Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by Russian-speaking cybercriminals:
1. They used remote administration tools.
2. They gained system administrators' credentials.
3. They explored the financial systems of the targeted organization.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context for the attack sequence:
- **Tactic: Credential Access, Technique: T1110-Brute Force**: This technique is used to gain unauthorized access to systems by trying multiple passwords.
- **Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's credentials.
- **Tactic: Collection, Technique: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to collect information.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the actions described in the question.

- **A: Impact**: This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data loss or system damage. It is unlikely to be the first step in the sequence.
- **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it is a critical step in many attacks, it is not the first step in the sequence described.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. It is a logical first step before gaining credentials and exploring systems.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location. It is a step that typically occurs after gaining access and exploring the system.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance (Discovery)**: The attackers would first need to gather information about the target's environment, including the credentials of system administrators. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Credential Access**: Once they have gathered the necessary information, they would use techniques like brute force (T1110) to gain the credentials of the system administrators.
3. **Lateral Movement and Exploration**: With the credentials, they can then move laterally within the network and explore the financial systems.

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the actions described in the question is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C
