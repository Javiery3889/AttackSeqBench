Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider. This file is then used to execute the EVILNUM malware, which disguises its headless Javascript agent as decoy business files.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the execution of a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves the use of a malicious link to deliver a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising the malware to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**: This tactic is about identifying and exploiting the victim's systems, which does not fit the sequence described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Execution**: This tactic is about running the malware, but it does not address how the malware was initially delivered to the victim.
- **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining access to the victim's system, which aligns with the scenario of the victim following a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider.
- **Answer Choice D: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the victim's system, which is not directly related to the initial delivery of the malware.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The scenario describes a victim following a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider.
2. The related TTPs mention the use of a malicious link (T1204.001) to deliver a malicious file (T1204.002).
3. The initial access to the system is the first step in the attack sequence, which is best described by the "Initial Access" tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
