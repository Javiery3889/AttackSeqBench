Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server to download its backdoor and data stealer components. This implies that the malware first needs to establish a connection or gain access to the remote server before downloading the components.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Collection (T1074.002-Remote Data Staging)**: This technique involves gathering data from a remote system and staging it for exfiltration. While this is related to data handling, it doesn't directly address the initial contact or access to the remote server.
- **Exfiltration (T1029-Scheduled Transfer, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)**: These techniques involve transferring data from the target system to an external location. However, they are more relevant to the stage after the malware has already gained access and downloaded its components.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Execution (T1055.005-Scriptlet)**: This technique involves executing code or scripts. While it can be part of the malware's initial stages, it doesn't directly address the contact with the remote server.
- **Command and Control (T1047-Remote Services, T1048-Port Forwarding, T1049-Proxy) and (T1046-External Remote Services)**: These techniques involve establishing a connection to a remote server for command and control purposes. This is the most relevant tactic as it directly addresses the contact with the remote server.
- **Lateral Movement (T1028-Path Discovery, T1027-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, T1025-Exploitation for Lateral Movement)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network. While it can be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly address the initial contact with the remote server.
- **Initial Access (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, T1197-Unsecured Remote Desktop Protocol, T1195-Exploit Public Server, T1193-Unauthorized Access via Remote Services)**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system. While it is a critical step, it doesn't directly address the contact with the remote server for downloading components.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the malware contacted a remote server to download its components.
- The most relevant tactic in this context is **Command and Control (C2)**, as it directly involves establishing a connection to a remote server for command and control purposes, which is necessary before downloading the malware components.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
