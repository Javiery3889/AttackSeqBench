Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the StellarParticle campaign:
- AdFind
- PowerShell cmdlets
- Custom tools
- Gathering Active Directory information
- Identifying systems for access

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018-Remote System Discovery
- Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred after the initial gathering of Active Directory information and identification of systems for access.

- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. While it is a precursor to the attack, it does not directly follow the gathering of Active Directory information and identification of systems for access.
- **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. The question does not describe the initial access but rather the actions taken after the initial access.
- **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker learning more about the target environment, such as identifying systems, services, and users. The gathering of Active Directory information and identification of systems for access aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
- **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials to access systems or networks. While this is a step that follows the identification of systems, the question does not specifically mention credential access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The StellarParticle campaign used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access.
- This aligns with the Discovery tactic, which involves learning more about the target environment.
- The next logical step after gathering Active Directory information and identifying systems would be to further discover details about the systems and their configurations, which is also part of the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
