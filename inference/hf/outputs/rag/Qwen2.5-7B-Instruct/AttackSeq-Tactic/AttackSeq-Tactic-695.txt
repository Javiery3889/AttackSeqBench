Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group:
1. Executed a downloader.
2. Issued commands and collected data.
3. Evaded defenses by deleting files and killing processes.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs mention:
- Tactic: Defense Evasion
- Technique: T1070.004-File Deletion

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic occurred before the group evaded defenses by deleting files and killing processes.

- **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network or system. While it is a common tactic, it does not directly relate to the specific actions of deleting files and killing processes.
- **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While reconnaissance might be part of the initial phase, it does not directly lead to the deletion of files and killing of processes.
- **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it can be a precursor to many actions, it does not directly relate to the specific actions of deleting files and killing processes.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves avoiding or blocking detection by the defender. The related TTPs specifically mention T1070.004-File Deletion, which is a technique used to evade detection by deleting files. This suggests that the group was already in the process of evading defenses, which implies that other actions had already occurred.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Sednit group executed a downloader and issued commands and collected data.
2. These actions are part of the initial compromise and data collection phase.
3. The next step was to evade defenses by deleting files and killing processes, which is a Defense Evasion tactic.
4. The related TTPs specifically mention T1070.004-File Deletion, which is a technique used in the Defense Evasion tactic.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the group was already in the process of evading defenses before they deleted files and killed processes.

**Final Answer: D**
