Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where RIG EK gains initial access through malvertising and redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this initial access.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker's efforts to develop and maintain the resources needed for an attack.
- **Tactic: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods and techniques used by attackers to initially infiltrate a network or system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about the attacker's efforts to develop and maintain the resources needed for an attack. While it is a necessary step, it does not directly relate to the specific method of gaining initial access through malvertising.
- **Answer Choice B: Initial Access** - This tactic directly involves the methods and techniques used by attackers to initially infiltrate a network or system. The question mentions that RIG EK gains initial access through malvertising, which is a specific technique under the Initial Access tactic.
- **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to steal data from the compromised system. This is not relevant to the initial access phase.
- **Answer Choice D: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to cause harm or disruption to the victim's systems. This is also not relevant to the initial access phase.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a specific method of gaining initial access (malvertising and redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript).
- The related TTPs mention the Initial Access tactic, which includes the technique T1189-Drive-by Compromise, which aligns with the method described in the question.
- The Resource Development tactic, while important, does not directly relate to the specific method of gaining initial access through malvertising.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
