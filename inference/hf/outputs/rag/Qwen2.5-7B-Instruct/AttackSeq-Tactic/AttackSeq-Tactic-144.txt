Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions by the actor "FamousSparrow":
1. Used SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server.
2. Used HTTPS and encrypted communications.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next in the attack sequence.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provided are:
- Tactic: Command and Control
- Technique: T1071.001-Web Protocols

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the provided information:

- **A: Impact**
  - Impact is a tactic that describes the final effect of the attack, such as data destruction or modification. Given that the actor has already established communication with the C&C server, it is unlikely that the next step would be to cause an impact immediately.

- **B: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) is a tactic that involves the actor maintaining control over the compromised system. Since the actor has already established communication with the C&C server, this tactic is highly relevant and likely to continue.

- **C: Exfiltration**
  - Exfiltration is the tactic of transferring data from the target system to the attacker. While this is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly implied by the information given. The actor has established communication but not necessarily exfiltrated data yet.

- **D: Collection**
  - Collection is the tactic of gathering information from the target system. This is a logical step before exfiltration, but it is not as directly implied by the given information as Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actor has established communication with the C&C server using SparrowDoor and HTTPS.
- The next logical step in maintaining control over the compromised system would be to continue using the established Command and Control channel.
- The related TTPs specifically mention Command and Control as the relevant tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
