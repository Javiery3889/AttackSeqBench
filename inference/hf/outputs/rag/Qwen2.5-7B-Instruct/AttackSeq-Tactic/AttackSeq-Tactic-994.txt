Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a spear-phishing attack is used to exploit a vulnerability in Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver a secondary payload. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to run code on the victim's system.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves executing a malicious file.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using a spear-phishing email with an attachment to gain initial access to the victim's system.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It involves the development of resources for an attack, which is not the immediate step before the execution of the payload.
- **Answer Choice B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not the immediate step before the execution of the payload.
- **Answer Choice C: Execution**: This tactic is directly related to the execution of the payload. However, the question asks which tactic occurred before the execution, not during or after.
- **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target system, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps. The spear-phishing attack and the exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) fall under the Initial Access tactic.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The spear-phishing attack (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment) is the initial method used to gain access to the victim's system.
- After gaining initial access, the exploit of the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) is used to deliver and execute the secondary payload.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the Initial Access tactic occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

**Final Answer: D**
