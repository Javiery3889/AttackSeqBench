Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where BlueDelta redirects victims' future incoming emails to an actor-controlled address by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software. This indicates that the initial step involves gaining access to the webmail system and then setting up a redirection mechanism.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's system or network.
- **Exploit Public-Facing Application (Technique T1190):** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining resources for the attack.
- **Email Accounts (Technique T1586.002):** This technique involves the adversary compromising email accounts.
- **Collection (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target.
- **Email Forwarding Rule (Technique T1114.003):** This technique involves the adversary setting up rules to forward emails to a different address.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This is the first step where the adversary gains access to the system. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (T1190) is a common method for gaining initial access.
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** This is a subsequent step where the adversary might develop additional tools or maintain access.
- **Collection (Tactic):** This is a step where the adversary gathers information, which could be part of the overall attack but is not the initial step.
- **Email Forwarding Rule (Technique T1114.003):** This is a specific technique used to redirect emails, which is a step that occurs after gaining access.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access (Tactic):** The adversary must first gain access to the Roundcube webmail system. This is done by exploiting vulnerabilities (T1190).
2. **Email Forwarding Rule (Technique T1114.003):** After gaining access, the adversary sets up the email forwarding rule to redirect emails to a controlled address.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access is gained first, followed by the setting up of the email forwarding rule.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
