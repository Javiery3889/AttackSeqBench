Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests.
   - The next step in the sequence is to send encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and using C2 channels to direct the actions of the compromised system.
   - **Web Protocols (Technique T1071.001):** This technique involves using web protocols for C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target.
   - **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (Technique T1041):** This technique involves using a C2 channel to exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question mentions that the data is sent to the control servers, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - The data is described as encrypted and obfuscated, which is a common practice in exfiltration to avoid detection.
   - The related TTPs specifically mention "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" (T1041), which directly describes the scenario of sending data over a C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Rising Sun implant has established a C2 channel using HTTP POST requests (Command and Control).
   - The next logical step is to send data over this channel.
   - The data is described as encrypted and obfuscated, which is a characteristic of exfiltration.
   - The related TTPs explicitly mention "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" (T1041), which fits the scenario perfectly.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is A: Exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
