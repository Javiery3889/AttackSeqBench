### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs where Longhorn (a hypothetical adversary) uses in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting.
   - The question implies that these actions are part of a sequence, and we need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Analyze the Related TTPs:**
   - **T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe:** This technique involves wiping disk content, which is a form of data destruction.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This is a broader technique that includes methods to destroy data, which can include disk wiping.
   - **T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files, which is a form of defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves stealing data from a system. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly relate to the specific TTPs mentioned (in-memory de-obfuscation and secure erase).
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or defend against defensive measures. The TTPs mentioned (file deletion) are related to this tactic, but they do not directly precede the in-memory de-obfuscation and secure erase.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves the adversary learning about the target environment. While discovery can precede other actions, it does not directly relate to the specific TTPs mentioned.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The TTPs mentioned (in-memory de-obfuscation and secure erase) are more likely to occur after gaining access, as they are actions taken to maintain persistence or cover tracks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of the question and the related TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be that the adversary first gains initial access to the system, and then uses in-memory de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before these actions is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: D**
