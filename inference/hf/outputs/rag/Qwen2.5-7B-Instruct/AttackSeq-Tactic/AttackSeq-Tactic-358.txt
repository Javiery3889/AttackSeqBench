Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has already established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The next step in the sequence is to transfer the collected data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Command and Control (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems.
  - **Technique T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols, which aligns with the initial communication setup.
  - **Technique T1071.004-DNS:** This technique involves using DNS for command and control, which is consistent with the initial communication setup.
- **Exfiltration (Tactic):** This tactic involves the adversary transferring data from the target's systems to an external location.
  - **Technique T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves using the C2 channel for data exfiltration, which is relevant to the context of the question.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Resource Development** - This tactic is not directly related to the transfer of data or the establishment of a C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control** - While this tactic is involved in the initial setup of the C2 channel, it does not specifically address the transfer of data.
- **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration** - This tactic directly addresses the transfer of data from the target's systems to an external location, which is the next logical step after establishing the C2 channel.
- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the target network, which is not directly related to the transfer of data over an established C2 channel.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial setup of the C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- The next step in the sequence is the transfer of collected data.
- Among the given answer choices, **Exfiltration** (Answer Choice C) is the most relevant tactic as it directly addresses the transfer of data from the target's systems to an external location, which is the logical next step after establishing the C2 channel.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
