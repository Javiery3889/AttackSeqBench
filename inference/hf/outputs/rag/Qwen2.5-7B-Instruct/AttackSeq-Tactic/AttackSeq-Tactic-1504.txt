Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Mimikatz is used to capture passwords.
2. Core malware Anunak is employed in targeted attacks.
3. RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools are used to evade detection.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the theft of authentication credentials.
- **LSASS Memory**: This technique is a method under Credential Access to extract credentials from the LSASS process.
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network.
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: This technique is a method under Lateral Movement to access remote systems.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the attackers employed RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to evade detection.

- **A: Resource Development**: This tactic is about developing resources for an attack, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves the execution of malware or other code, which is part of the sequence but not necessarily the step before RDPdoor.
- **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a network, which could be a step after capturing credentials and before using RDPdoor.
- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is the first step in the sequence described.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access (D)**: The attackers use Mimikatz to capture passwords, which falls under the Credential Access tactic.
2. **Persistence (C)**: After capturing credentials, the attackers might use them to establish persistence, which could involve using RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to maintain access.
3. **Execution (B)**: The core malware Anunak is executed, which is a step in the sequence but not necessarily before RDPdoor.
4. **Lateral Movement (Lateral Movement tactic, not a specific technique)**: The use of RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to move laterally within the network is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.

Given the sequence and the related TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the attackers employed RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: C
