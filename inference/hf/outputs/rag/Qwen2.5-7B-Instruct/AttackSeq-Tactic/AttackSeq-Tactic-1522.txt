Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement across the network to expand their control. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this action.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Persistence, Technique: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain access to the network by using domain accounts.
- **Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This indicates that the attackers are using valid accounts to gain initial access to the network.
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This suggests that the attackers are using valid accounts to evade detection.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Resource Development**: This tactic is about developing and maintaining the resources needed to carry out the attack. It does not directly follow the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or countermeasures. While it is relevant, it does not directly follow the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one asset to another within the target network. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this is not the next step.
- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target network. After using stolen credentials to move laterally, the next logical step would be to collect information from the network.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement, which is a form of Initial Access (T1078-Valid Accounts).
- After lateral movement, the attackers would likely want to gather information from the network to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
- The related TTPs do not directly suggest a step after lateral movement, but the logical next step in an attack sequence is to collect information.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
