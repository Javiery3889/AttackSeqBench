Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Identifying installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word.
2. Bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**
- **Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1518-Software Discovery**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred prior to the bypass during the Freakyshelly targeted attack.

- **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's system. The question does not mention any initial access method, so this is less likely.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying the target's environment and systems. The question mentions identifying installed software, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
- **Credential Access (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials. The question does not mention any credential access, so this is less likely.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker bypassing security mechanisms. The question mentions bypassing detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Identifying Installed Software**: This action is described as part of the Discovery tactic (T1518-Software Discovery).
2. **Bypassing Detection**: This action is described as part of the Defense Evasion tactic (T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion).

Given that the question asks which tactic most likely occurred prior to the bypass, the logical sequence is:
- **Discovery** (identifying installed software) -> **Defense Evasion** (bypassing detection).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B
