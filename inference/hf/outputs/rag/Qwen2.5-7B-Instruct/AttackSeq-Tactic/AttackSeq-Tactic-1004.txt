Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Monitoring targets through benign emails to understand click habits.
2. Using mailing lists to build trust.
3. Sending emails mimicking legitimate password recovery to harvest credentials.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Initial Access (Tactic):** T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** T1586.002-Email Accounts
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** T1598.003-Spearphishing Link

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which tactic most likely occurred before the WINDSHIFT sent emails mimicking legitimate password recovery to harvest credentials.

- **Initial Access (Tactic):** This typically involves gaining initial entry into a network or system. The T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is a specific technique under Initial Access.
- **Resource Development (Tactic):** This involves gathering and maintaining access to resources. The T1586.002-Email Accounts is a specific technique under Resource Development.
- **Reconnaissance (Tactic):** This involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. The T1598.003-Spearphishing Link is a specific technique under Reconnaissance.

### Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Monitoring targets through benign emails to understand click habits** aligns with **Reconnaissance** (T1598.003-Spearphishing Link).
2. **Using mailing lists to build trust** aligns with **Resource Development** (T1586.002-Email Accounts).
3. **Sending emails mimicking legitimate password recovery to harvest credentials** aligns with **Initial Access** (T1566.002-Spearphishing Link).

### Final Answer
The sequence of TTPs described in the question logically follows the order of **Reconnaissance**, **Resource Development**, and then **Initial Access**. Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before WINDSHIFT sent emails mimicking legitimate password recovery to harvest credentials is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
