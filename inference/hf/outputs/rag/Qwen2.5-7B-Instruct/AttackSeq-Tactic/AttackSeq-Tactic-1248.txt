Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question states that Mustang Panda utilized the double extension trick and delivered PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade security defenses. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs are:
- T1036.005-Match Legitimate Name or Location
- T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading
- T1036.007-Double File Extension

These techniques are all related to Defense Evasion, which aligns with the question's context of evading security defenses.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the related TTPs:

- **A: Command and Control**
  - Command and Control (C2) is about maintaining access to the compromised system. While it is a common tactic after initial access, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned (double extension, DLL side-loading, and matching legitimate names).

- **B: Persistence**
  - Persistence is about maintaining long-term access to the system. While it is a common tactic after initial access, it is not directly related to the techniques mentioned (double extension, DLL side-loading, and matching legitimate names).

- **C: Initial Access**
  - Initial Access is about gaining initial foothold in the network. This is the first step in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the techniques mentioned (double extension, DLL side-loading, and matching legitimate names).

- **D: Defense Evasion**
  - Defense Evasion is about evading detection and analysis by the defender. The related TTPs (T1036.005, T1574.002, T1036.007) are all techniques for evading detection, which aligns perfectly with the question's context of evading security defenses.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes actions that are aimed at evading security defenses.
- The related TTPs are all techniques for Defense Evasion.
- The techniques mentioned (double extension, DLL side-loading, and matching legitimate names) are all methods to evade detection and analysis.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion, as it directly aligns with the techniques and the goal of evading security defenses.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
