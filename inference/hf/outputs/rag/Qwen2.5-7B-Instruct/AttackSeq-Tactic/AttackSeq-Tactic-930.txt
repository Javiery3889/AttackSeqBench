Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. The attacker decrypted obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor.
2. The attacker deployed the njRAT remote access tool.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
The related TTPs provide context:
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
- **Technique: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
- **Technique: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. The question mentions "decrypted obfuscated registry content," which aligns with this technique.
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information. The question mentions "decrypted obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor," which aligns with this technique.

### Step 4: Determine the Plausible Sequence
The sequence of actions described in the question involves:
1. Decryption of obfuscated content (T1140).
2. Deployment of a remote access tool (njRAT).

Given the related TTPs, the decryption of obfuscated content (T1140) is a form of defense evasion (T1027). After this, the attacker would likely use the decrypted information to deploy the njRAT, which is a form of command and control.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- **Defense Evasion** (T1027) for the decryption of obfuscated content.
- **Command and Control** (B) for deploying the njRAT.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
