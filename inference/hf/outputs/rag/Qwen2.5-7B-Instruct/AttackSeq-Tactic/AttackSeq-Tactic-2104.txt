Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step to determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in an attack:
1. Scanning the corporate internal network for open ports.
2. Using the Nidiran back door to exfiltrate data.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems to be targeted.
- **Network Service Discovery (T1046)**: This technique is a specific method under the Discovery tactic that involves identifying open ports and services.
- **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the victim's network to an external location.
- **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This technique is a specific method under the Exfiltration tactic that involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**
  - This is a tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over a victim's systems. It is not directly related to the initial scanning of open ports or the exfiltration of data using the Nidiran back door.
- **Choice B: Discovery**
  - This tactic involves identifying the network and systems to be targeted. The question mentions scanning for open ports, which is a form of network service discovery (T1046). This aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
- **Choice C: Lateral Movement**
  - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly mentioned in the question.
- **Choice D: Execution**
  - This tactic involves running malicious code or commands on the target system. While the Nidiran back door is a form of execution, the question specifically mentions scanning for open ports and exfiltration, which are more closely aligned with the Discovery and Exfiltration tactics.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial step of scanning for open ports, which is a form of network service discovery (T1046) under the Discovery tactic.
- The next step is using the Nidiran back door to exfiltrate data, which is a form of data exfiltration (T1041) under the Exfiltration tactic.
- The related TTPs confirm that Network Service Discovery (T1046) is under the Discovery tactic and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) is under the Exfiltration tactic.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described in the question is the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
