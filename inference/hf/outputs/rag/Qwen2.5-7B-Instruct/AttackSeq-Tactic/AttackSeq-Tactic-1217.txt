Let's analyze the question and the related TTPs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for communication with a command and control (C2) domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure. We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next.

### Step 2: Analyze the Related TTPs
- **Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data at a scheduled time, which is related to data exfiltration.
- **Tactic: Command and Control, Technique: T1071.004-DNS**: This technique involves using DNS for C2 communication.
- **Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell for execution, which can be part of the initial or subsequent stages of an attack.

### Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the C2 communication described in the question.
- **Answer Choice B: Impact**: This tactic involves causing damage or unwanted effects, which could be a result of the attack but is not the immediate next step after C2 communication.
- **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network, which is directly related to the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for C2 communication.
- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network, which could be a subsequent step but is not as directly related to the C2 communication as Command and Control.

### Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for C2 communication, which is a Command and Control activity.
- The next logical step in an attack sequence involving C2 communication would be to maintain and possibly expand the access within the network, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
- Exfiltration and Lateral Movement are subsequent steps but are not as directly related to the immediate next step after establishing C2 communication.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
